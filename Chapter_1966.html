  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng practiced this set of swordsmanship, he sheathed the Great Weighty Sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>Although Livingston's mind was indeed a bit muddled, one couldn't challenge his talent in the field of weapon refining. When the Infinity Stone was not enough to make a sword hilt, it was he who came up with an ingenious way for storing Luo Zheng's sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to take Livingston's advice to smash the sword on his opponent, but he liked the Great Weighty Sword very much.</p>

  <p>This sword didn't seem to be flexible at all.</p>

  <p>But it was very compatible with Luo Zheng's swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>In any case, the Emotion Closing Divine Dao stressed on killing with a single blow; it did not call for any sophisticated swordsmanship. So it was not a flexible sword technique to begin with!</p>

  <p>Thanks to the Great Weighty Sword, he could multiply the power of his strike.</p>

  <p>"This Great Weighty Sword is not bad. It's great for me to use!" Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>The scene that Luo Luo Zheng swiped the heavy sword with ease left Livingston dumbstruck. Now that he heard Luo Zheng's praise, he was very excited. "I haven't had a rest in years; I have been making some other treasures too!"</p>

  <p>Livingston was like a child who wanted to show off all the nice things he had to his parent. He took out all the things he had meticulously crafted over the years in one go.</p>

  <p>If he said he didn't have a moment to rest, then it must be true!</p>

  <p>Although Livingston's body was ugly, it had one advantage. As long as there were enough life vitality crystals, it could operate nonstop. He did not need any time to rest. He was constantly researching and trying to understand the characteristics of the materials in the weapon refining workshop, and he kept inventing and innovating treasures based on these materials. If he didn't understand some material, he would go to the library to learn everything about it.</p>

  <p>The only problem was that Livingston was completely self-centered and a workaholic. In the past few years, he didn't even pay attention to the new group of people. He was totally immersed in his own world.</p>

  <p>"This is the Alms Bowl of Acalanatha. A first-rank divine weapon.</p>

  <p>This is the Will of Harmony. Even though it is just an ornament, it can nourish a pill with its energy.</p>

  <p>This is the Cloud Flute..." He showed off all his inventions with great pride and aplomb.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the magical trinkets refined by Livingston were defensive treasures.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's current body was tough enough, and he even had the Redemption Armor made by Holy Drew. Holy Drew had used the source of Godly Tile to make the Redemption Armor. The items made by Livingston, although impressive, were not of much use to Luo Luo Zheng now.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't deny their value even if he did not have a need for them.</p>

  <p>Livingston's skill combined with these rare materials from the divine land in the refining workshop, created treasures that could easily fuel a war in the universe.</p>

  <p>"Take all of them!" Livingston chuckled.</p>

  <p>He didn't need these treasures for himself. His interest lay in the refining process and not the end products. Moreover, the materials he used to make these treasures did not belong to him. His only request was for Luo Luo Zheng to not to kick him out of the refining workshop.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't hold back and grabbed the trinkets. So what if he didn't need these things? Ning Yudie and the others might need them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he gave all the treasures to Ning Yudie so that she could gauge their characteristics and assign them to suitable people accordingly.</p>

  <p>After handing over these items, Livingston entered the material storehouse in the workshop and began to study a rare material that he had never seen before. He no longer paid attention to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stayed in the Immortal Mansion for two days.</p>

  <p>Since Mu Ning was not in the Immortal Mansion, the girls got along surprisingly well with each other.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie might be willful sometimes, but as the leader of Cloud Hall, she still had a gentle demeanor. Mu Ning, on the other hand, was quite calm and composed at all times. She and Ning Yudie had always been amicable and cordial with each other.</p>

  <p>As for Freya, her attitude was even more restrained. Strictly speaking, she was the strongest within the Immortal Mansion, yet she behaved like a servant girl, taking care of all the miscellaneous trivial matters in the palace.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hadn't bothered to ask about the private matters of these people who were staying in the Immortal Mansion for a few years, but Ning Yudie casually mentioned them while they were chatting.</p>

  <p>The Immortal Mansion had been slowly floating within the space created by the Teleportation Token in the last two days.</p>

  <p>On the third day, the Immortal Mansion was flying towards the core supreme world of the Celestial Position race at a high speed. In the end, it landed within the borders of the Breaking Cloud Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The Immortal Mansion rotated slowly and landed softly on the side of Breaking Cloud Mountain.</p>

  <p>The ones who had lived in the Immortal Mansion for a few years wanted to see the outside world. Whether it was Imogen or Luo Nian, they all appeared to be impatient to get out and leave the confines of the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>However, when the Immortal Mansion descended firmly on the ground, Luo Luo Zheng prohibited them from leaving, choosing to only take Ning Yudie and Freya out.</p>

  <p>There was a big difference in the vitality between heaven and earth in the Lower World and the Upper World. So the warriors who had just ascended to the Upper World needed to stay in the Ascending Wells in order to adjust to the vitality between heaven and earth in the Upper World. Ning Yudie and Freya had stayed in the Ascending Wells before, while the others had never been in the Upper World before. They would be unable to bear this new vitality between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>However, it wouldn't be difficult for the Celestial Position warriors to solve this problem.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Luo Zheng left the Immortal Mansion, dozens of beams of light shot out from the top of the Breaking Cloud Mountain. Naturally these warriors were from the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>The man in the lead cupped his hands towards Luo Luo Zheng and yelled, "Luo Luo Zheng, Master Feng has been waiting for a long time."</p>

  <p>Most of the people who came to welcome Luo Luo Zheng were world lords, and they were considered the elite warriors of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>Although their cultivation was similar to Luo Zheng's, when they saw Luo Luo Zheng, they were full of respect and admiration.</p>

  <p>Their respect was genuine and came from the bottom of their hearts, and not due to fear of Luo Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had left the Evolutionary Universe, his cultivation was at the Spirit Supreme Realm and he had returned as a world lord.</p>

  <p>Their respect for Luo Luo Zheng was also a result of his declaration of war.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's war declaration had struck a responsive chord in the hearts of many warriors. Many Supreme Lords also joined hands with Luo Luo Zheng and used this opportunity to declare war on the Sacred race. But, the truth was that the most excited people were the countless martial artists and not the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>These low-level martial artists were dissatisfied with the pacification tactics of the Supreme Lords. They had reached the point where they couldn't tolerate it any longer. They would rather die in battle than allow the Sacred race to behave so arrogantly!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's return had completely changed this situation and given them a way to vent their frustrations.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was in the Immortal Mansion for the past few days and was unaware of this grave situation in the outside world.</p>

  <p>All the warriors of various races in the universe were impassioned. The small races that had chosen to remain neutral and silent had also expressed their support for the human race. There was a light at the end of this horrific tunnel; they would fight against the invading Sacred race together.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he once again became an emotional anchor for all the warriors within the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was hard to contain the excitement in their hearts when they saw Luo Luo Zheng. People were overjoyed and filled with hope once again!</p>

  <p>"Please lead the way." Luo Luo Zheng was rather calm.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position warriors led the way, while Luo Luo Zheng, Ning Yudie and Freya followed behind.</p>

  <p>After crossing the Breaking Cloud Mountain, Luo Luo Zheng was brought into a hall at the back of the mountain. Master Feng and the Supreme Lords of the Celestial Position race were gathered in this hall.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng entered the hall, he saluted them. "Master Feng, you must have been waiting for a long time."</p>

  <p>Master Feng sized up Luo Luo Zheng as a look of gratification appeared on his elderly face. "You're the first Godly Genius to return," he said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Three years ago, what they let fly was a promise and a hope for future, and now was the time to make good on their hopes. This matter concerned the Celestial Position race, the Evolutionary Universe, and the fate of Holy Mike.</p>

  <p>"What about the others?" Luo Luo Zheng asked. It was only then that he realized that except him, no one else had been able to make it.</p>

  <p id="top_5">"I have already calculated where they are. They are all safe," replied Master Feng.</p>

  <p>Every single Godly Genius was an immeasurably valuable asset to the Evolutionary Universe, and the Celestial Position race placed all of its hopes on the Godly Geniuses. Naturally, they wouldn't allow any Godly Genius to be killed.</p>

  <p>The moment Master Feng learned that the Godly Geniuses had returned, he began to calculate where and when the Godly Geniuses would descend into the universe.</p>

  <p>Tianming had fallen into the territory of the ogres, and Kurt was the luckiest one, directly returning to the Blessed Buddha Land.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Lawson, Lone, Xenia, and Karl had fallen into the supreme worlds of small races. Their situation was relatively safe, and Master Feng only needed to send some people to bring them back.</p>

  <p>The only trouble was with Lucille and Nathan. The two of them had fallen into the Fiery Rock World occupied by the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Master Feng explained the situation of the other Godly Geniuses to Luo Luo Zheng, and then he smiled, "Luo Luo Zheng, you've been training in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land for three years, and you're already a world lord now. I wonder how strong you are."</p>

  <p>As he was speaking, he suddenly extended a finger and pointed it at Luo Luo Zheng without elaborating any further.</p>
