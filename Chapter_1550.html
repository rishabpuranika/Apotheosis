  <p>
</p>

  <p>Lucille's eyes held determination as she raised her wrist again and gently waved her fingers in the air. The thin chain dripped and hung down like crystal droplets between her fingers.</p>

  <p>"Metal Element Power!"</p>

  <p>The ring on her ring finger started to glow with a faint golden light, which gradually formed into a golden sword.</p>

  <p>The sword formed by the golden light didn't have a fixed shape. The rhombus-shaped golden ray was bound to Lucille's hand as it glinted marvelously under the light, like a snake's flicking tongue.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Lucille had quickly made her decision!</p>

  <p>She could tell that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't someone who would easily admit losing.</p>

  <p>Only by defeating such a man could she make him realize the gap between him and reality.</p>

  <p>Thus, she finally decided to kill him once. If he got mad, she could just pay him 500, 000 Illusion Points as an apology.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A gust of golden wind blew and Lucille's figure faded away into the wind, gone from everyone's sight in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng scanned his surroundings, and then his whole body suddenly flew backwards after he just focused for a second!</p>

  <p>"Shoop! Shoop! Shoop!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng flew backwards in the air, a series of gilded swords came crashing down from the sky like a golden storm.</p>

  <p>Each swing of the gilded swords left a deep hole in the ground. The usually empty space was filled with small, densely packed holes in just a second. It looked like a complete mess!</p>

  <p>The rain of golden swords covered an enormous area. At first, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't escape the storm of swords no matter how fast he retreated.</p>

  <p>After all, there were so many golden swords that even Luo Luo Zheng couldn't completely dodge them all!</p>

  <p>"Bash!"</p>

  <p>One golden sword suddenly pierced Luo Zheng's collarbone!</p>

  <p>Had it been any other warrior's body, the golden sword would've completely penetrated it and crushed it on the ground.</p>

  <p>However, the sword only cut through Luo Zheng's flesh. One end of the sword was embedded into his shoulder blade.</p>

  <p>The spectators on top of the city wall couldn't help but admire Luo Zheng's immense strength. However, Luo Luo Zheng was slightly shocked inside and thought, 'How could the golden sword's penetrating power be so strong?'</p>

  <p>Lucille summoned the golden sword with merely a ring on her Five-element Finger Chain, which could be considered a type of profound mystery of the Metal Law. As even the rain of gilded swords could break his divine weapon body, he couldn't imagine what that golden sword in Lucille's hand could do.</p>

  <p>"Shoop!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lucille floated far away as her cold eyes looked at Luo Zheng's flickering figure. "If you can't hold on, you can fly back to the main city.</p>

  <p>You will then have time to consider what you want from the Ji Clan," she said faintly.</p>

  <p>The common warriors considered working with the Ji Clan as a great opportunity and an honor. However, what Luo Luo Zheng wanted was more than that.</p>

  <p>"How stupid is that guy? Lucille said the Ji Clan will fulfill any of his requests, but he just refused her!"</p>

  <p>"I've never seen such a stupid person! This is the Ji Clan, a great clan that can influence the entire Thoughtless Minds. Guidance from the Ji Clan's Supreme Lord would save him a lot of struggles in life!"</p>

  <p>"I guess there are some people in the world who are really stupid. I don't know what this guy is thinking. Why does he bother struggling when Lucille can defeat him easily anyway?"</p>

  <p>Many warriors could only sigh and shake their heads at Luo Zheng's miserable state.</p>

  <p>They all thought that Luo Luo Zheng was arrogant and didn't know how to appreciate favors.</p>

  <p>Some of them even suspected that Luo Luo Zheng only displayed his strength to gain more power from the Ji Clan, but they believed that Lucille would defeat him sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"Bash!"</p>

  <p>Another golden sword descended and pierced through Luo Zheng's thigh, and left a bloody hole on the side of his leg!</p>

  <p>Red blood flowed from his right shoulder and his left leg, which made him look like a gory mess.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng appeared bedraggled, the small injury had little effect on him.</p>

  <p>However, his heart still felt heavy and overwhelmed. Such an ace talent like Lucille was truly extraordinary!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Luo Zheng had a strange thought about Layla. Layla's strength six years ago wasn't bad, but she was still much weaker compared to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Layla had just reached the Soul Sea Realm at that time, like Luo Luo Zheng had done now. He wondered if Layla had entered the Illusion Battlefield after six years. Like Lucille, Layla was also fated to lead the great world of chaos. Thus, he wondered who was stronger between the two of them.</p>

  <p>"What I want?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed into slits, and then he grinned. His body suddenly disappeared from where he stood, traversed through space and headed straight for her!</p>

  <p>But just as he entered the space, Lucille stretched her hand out and swept across, which caused the space below her to be distorted. As soon as Luo Zheng's figure reappeared, he found that he had returned to his original position.</p>

  <p>A warrior at Lucille's level had usually mastered the Time Law and Space Law. The moment when Luo Luo Zheng used the Space Law to penetrate space, Lucille waved her hand and twisted the space he crossed over.</p>

  <p>That was why Luo Luo Zheng went back to where he stood first even after summoning the Space Law.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Zheng's attack against Lucille was futile.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng faced Norton, he had also suffered a big loss when he crossed space.</p>

  <p>"Just accept it! Then let's talk," Lucille said indifferently. "Even though your body is as strong as a divine weapon, you can't withstand my attack!"</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng acted as if he heard nothing. If he accepted his defeat in front of her, then there would be no need for him to continue his journey in the Illusion Battlefield. He could just leave directly.</p>

  <p>"It's hard to get close to this woman," he murmured.</p>

  <p>His brows curved down into a frown. It was indeed difficult for him to break through the rain of sharp golden swords.</p>

  <p>When his Space Law failed to work, traces of white fog had once again appeared around Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>The Eight Smoky Melodies didn't need the Law Power to activate it, so Lucille's Five-element Finger Chain didn't affect it.</p>

  <p>His voice became as light as a willow catkin when the Eight Smoky Melodies was unleashed. Any energy ripple could push his body away.</p>

  <p>The onlookers thought that Luo Zheng's movement technique was extremely nimble. Now, none of the golden swords hit Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"What is this movement technique?"</p>

  <p>Lucille saw Luo Luo Zheng who quickly twisted his body amidst the golden swords like a loach, and dodged the dense blades with ease! The most important thing was Lucille couldn't see through his movement technique at all!</p>

  <p>At that moment, Lucille finally understood that this man was not as simple as she had imagined. He must be a great warrior!</p>

  <p>However, all the ace talents from the Blessed Buddha Land were monks.</p>

  <p>She also knew every ace talent from the Thoughtless Minds, and she had never heard of an ace talent named Tianxing in the Humanity Alliance. That meant he was not from any of the top three human forces. Then, where was he from?</p>

  <p>Now, the battle was currently at an impasse because Luo Luo Zheng activated the Eight Smoky Melodies.</p>

  <p>Even though there was a deadlock, the battle was still quite entertaining.</p>

  <p>The martial artists found it amazing to watch Luo Zheng's figure shuttle through the rain of golden swords.</p>

  <p>Some of them even looked at Luo Luo Zheng with such delight that they wanted to find a trace of mystery in Luo Zheng's technique and comprehend it.</p>

  <p>The Eight Smoky Melodies' only principle was to take advantage of the situation. There was no mystery or pattern. It was simply impossible for them to see through any of it by just relying on Luo Zheng's floating movement technique.</p>

  <p>"This man!"</p>

  <p>At that point, Lucille couldn't hold herself back anymore.</p>

  <p>There was no way she'd believe that she couldn't deal with him.</p>

  <p>As she thought about it, Lucille disappeared in the golden wind again.</p>

  <p>"Here she is!" Luo Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>He had been floating in the golden sword storm for quite a while now, waiting for this very moment!</p>

  <p>The golden wind flashed, and then Lucille suddenly appeared behind Luo Luo Zheng. The golden light in her palm shot out and extended into a ten feet long golden sword, which pierced towards Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>However, it was like Luo Luo Zheng had grown a pair of eyes behind him. His body started to sway in a spiral movement as he followed the golden sword and circled around it, careful to keep a distance of three inches during the whole process.</p>

  <p>Then, he appeared in front of Lucille in a mere second. The Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his hand flashed with a blue light as he swung it towards Lucille's face!</p>

  <p>Their distance now was the closest they ever got to each other, ever since their fight had started.</p>

  <p>Lucille didn't expect that Luo Luo Zheng would fly backwards and his extremely precise control of the distance. He had flown close to her golden sword but always kept three inches between them. His method was simply amazing!</p>
