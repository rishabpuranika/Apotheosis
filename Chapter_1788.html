<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"These two friends don't seem to be in a good mood." Dillon, a clever and considerate man, said in an attempt to help Zheng make the situation less uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan replied coldly, "I'm drinking with a bunch of ants from the Lower World. How do you expect me to be in a good mood?"</p>

  <p>Many of those who heard the response found it insulting.</p>

  <p>Various strong masters from all over the Central Region had come to visit the Cloud Hall. Said during this glorious and joyous occasion, Nathan's words offended some people.</p>

  <p>Yudie made a face at Zheng, who frowned and snapped, "If my hospitality has failed to please the two of you, then you can leave!"</p>

  <p>They had all relied on Zheng's Teleportation Token to get here. They could go back to the Upper World through the ascending passageway, but through there, there was no guarantee that they would return safely.</p>

  <p>Lawson curled his lips. He ignored Zheng, and when he spoke, it was to support Nathan. "What was wrong with what Nathan said? Martial artists from the Lower World don't even compare to ants, and that's a fact."</p>

  <p>From the perspective of these top warriors, this was an accepted truth. If it weren't for Zheng, they wouldn't have had any connection with the Lower World.</p>

  <p>"Really? Why is it, then, that as the number one Godly Genius in the universe, you still lost to Zheng?" Margaret snapped. She could no longer sit there and watch this senseless argument go on. Among the people who the two had referred to as ants were members of her family. Today, Xander had even brought the core members of the Ethereal Spirit Sect to the banquet.</p>

  <p>Margaret saw herself as someone who often caused trouble without reason. Today, she discovered that these two fellows from the Thoughtless Minds were even more unreasonable than she was.</p>

  <p>"Hmph. He's simply an exception, a special ant," Nathan snorted. Deep inside, he also did not understand how someone like Zheng had found his way into this great world.</p>

  <p>Nurturing an ace talent or a Godly Genius required plenty of resources.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, the Central Region was not the kind of place to catch the eye or produce outstanding talents. Zheng coming from such a place defied logic.</p>

  <p>"What about me? Am I an exception, too?" Margaret raised an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how many exceptions there are in the Central Region," Tianming said.</p>

  <p>Among the top ten warriors of the supreme worlds, the Central Region nurtured three. Despite the power of the Thoughtless Minds, they were only able to secure the same number of places— three out of ten.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Nathan was at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, Kurt, who had been silently enjoying a selection of vegetarian dishes the whole time, smiled and chimed in, "Amitabha, the Central Region is truly too mystical. It takes three places in the heavens.</p>

  <p>A talent of our Blessed Buddha Land even stays here, still unnoticed."</p>

  <p>Everyone looked curiously at Kurt. Nobody knew what he meant.</p>

  <p>Lewis and Patrick drank in silence.</p>

  <p>The low tables, each accommodating three to five people, were lined up in a single row. Lewis, Patrick, and Tianming shared the same table, and all three sat above the salt.</p>

  <p>Lewis and Patrick's friendship with Zheng and Tianming had granted them seats of honor in the banquet.</p>

  <p>Their strength and status alone didn't make them qualified to sit where they were.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the conversations between Zheng and the others, Patrick and Lewis were shocked to the core.</p>

  <p>How big was the universe?</p>

  <p>The two had never seen it before, but from what Tianming had said, there were trillions of Soul Sea Realm warriors out there!</p>

  <p>Trillions!</p>

  <p>When they heard this, they were so astonished that they almost fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>In comparison, there were much fewer Soul Sea Realm warriors in this great world. The real power of the universe seemed to be beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>They had just found out, from what Zheng had said, that these people were the top Godly Geniuses in the entire universe!</p>

  <p>At the time, they didn't know what the title of Godly Genius meant.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, to be able to stand out among trillions of Soul Sea Realm cultivators and be among the top 10 indicated that their talents were beyond astonishing.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a strange feeling overcame Patrick. He felt like someone was watching him. When he looked around, he found out that Kurt was staring at him. Now that he thought about it, he was sure that Kurt had been staring at him the whole time. The realization sent chills down his spine.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had led this group away to rescue Yudie, this monk had stared at him the same way. Why was he doing it again?</p>

  <p>Kurt gazed at Patrick, who was deep in thought about why this was happening. One by one, the group seemed to notice. Everyone followed Kurt's gaze until, in the end, all their gazes landed on Patrick.</p>

  <p>"Hey, hey, your companion is gazing at you again," Lewis teased as he elbowed Patrick in the arm.</p>

  <p>"Damn you! He's your companion, not mine!" Patrick hated it when people stared, especially when they did it in this manner, but Lewis' remark made him feel even worse. He couldn't help but curse him.</p>

  <p>Lewis, on the other hand, was amused, but when he, too, could tell that Patrick was already feeling a little nervous, he decided to keep quiet.</p>

  <p>"Kurt, what do you mean by that?" A hint of curiosity flashed on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>After ascending to the Upper World, Zheng had never entered the Blessed Buddha Land. The Buddhism they practiced there was unusual, and some parts of it were quite mysterious. He had a feeling that there was something behind Kurt's words.</p>

  <p>Kurt smiled and nodded at Patrick. "May I know your name, Mister?"</p>

  <p>"Patrick Pei." Patrick stood up and put his palms together as a form of salute.</p>

  <p>Some might have found this strange, as Kurt looked like a little acolyte.</p>

  <p>He was even younger than Patrick was. However, he was still a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior. Thus, Patrick politely paid him due respect.</p>

  <p>After Patrick had greeted him with a salute, Kurt did the same and put his palms together. He said, "Amitabha, you are the reincarnation of the Acalanatha, but right now, you have a very slim chance of ascending to the Upper World. If you come to our Blessed Buddha Land, we will train you and mold you into a Godly Genius..." Without waiting for a response, Kurt turned to Zheng and Yudie. "I wonder... If I want to take someone away from the Cloud Hall, will you permit me to do so?" he asked.</p>
