<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Glint Pearl was the only glowing object amidst the dark surroundings, but little inky black moths the size of a finger continuously circled around it.</p>

  <p>The moths seemed to hate the light, so a few of them suddenly shot towards the Glint Pearl, and in a second, the last ray of light was gone.</p>

  <p>Once again, the moths sank into the darkness.</p>

  <p>Shock was written all over Ab's face. "These are..."</p>

  <p>"These are Cannibal Moths! And here... This is the Nether Water!"</p>

  <p>"The dripping sound we heard just now was from the Nether Water!"</p>

  <p>"We should leave now?"</p>

  <p>The seven Hou brothers who had mocked Luo Luo Zheng just a while ago were now scared out of their wits.</p>

  <p>There was a Magical Insect List in the universe, and all the insects ranked in the list had extremely powerful abilities. The Cannibal Moth was one of the very dangerous insects included in the list.</p>

  <p>For instance, the Ice Jade Butterfly was ranked fifty-first in the list.</p>

  <p>Although it was deceptively beautiful, it was immensely lethal: any living being exposed to its cold poison would freeze quickly; even their souls would no longer fall into the path of reincarnation.</p>

  <p>The vicious Cannibal Moth was ranked twenty-first on the list. It normally lived in the form of an insect egg in the Nether Water, and would remain like so even after thousands of years. As long as it was under the Nether Water, the insect egg could live up to a hundred thousand to even a million years long.</p>

  <p>However, once the Cannibal Moths felt the existence of a living creature and needed to search for food, the insect eggs would control the Nether Water and let it flow out. Then, the Cannibal Moths would hatch out from the insect eggs and search for food in the darkness!</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Luo Zheng used his magical eyes to see the drops of Nether Water that dripped down from above. In a blink of an eye, the finger-sized black moths had hatched and come out of the water.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't be much of a threat if they were ordinary moths, but Luo Luo Zheng had felt the strong Mu Ning of the extremely rare Dark Law. He had encountered this kind of Dark Law before in the Enchanted Barrier Tower. This Law Power seemed to be the light's enemy and could devour all the light, which was why the underground palace was pitch black.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that the moths weren't ordinary when he saw them. Thus, he asked Lincoln to open the entrance to the underground palace the soonest possible.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the fearless seven Hou brothers seemed to ignore the danger, so Luo Luo Zheng didn't say much anymore. He couldn't be bothered to remind them!</p>

  <p>The seven Hou brothers were a collective of independent warriors, so they did everything in the universe together. They had extraordinary experiences and insights, but now that they realized that those moths were Cannibal Moths, how could they even stay there? Two of them named Deke and Finn quickly rushed to the passageway in front of the underground palace.</p>

  <p>"That is also..." Luo Luo Zheng saw them and wanted to say that the Dark Law had also engulfed that side.</p>

  <p>The two Hou brothers reached the exit and had just ignited two oil lamps on both sides of the passageway just now, but the oil lamps' light was quite dim. It turned out that there were Cannibal Moths that flew towards the passageway's exit!</p>

  <p>But before Luo Luo Zheng could even warn them, Deke and Finn charged straight ahead. Strong cyan gales suddenly appeared from their bodies, and wrapped them in layers of cyan wind as they rushed towards the other side of the passageway.</p>

  <p>However, black spots appeared above the two oil lamps before they could enter the passageway. Then, the oil lamps were extinguished with a loud bang. Only two miserable shrieks were heard after that, followed by the audible crack of shattering bones.</p>

  <p>Once again, the entrance to the underground palace had completely sunk into darkness and deathly silence.</p>

  <p>Naturally, everyone was like a blind person without the oil lamps' light.</p>

  <p>What made everything worse was that countless Cannibal Moths still roamed around the area!</p>

  <p>No one wanted to make any more light rays because as long as there was light, the Cannibal Moths would attack them. They would end up with their flesh and blood devoured by the moths, and be left as lifeless skeletons. Moreover, it was also said that the Cannibal Moths could also devour souls.</p>

  <p>The most important thing about the Cannibal Moths was their special ability. Even if their bodies were doused in flames and shocked with lightning, they couldn't be stopped and could still attack.</p>

  <p>Freya clenched her teeth hard in the inky blackness. Even though she was terrified, she wouldn't cause Luo Luo Zheng any trouble.</p>

  <p>She was mentally prepared since she had finally decided to follow Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Of course, she wouldn't regret making such a decision!</p>

  <p>"What do we do now..." Baal cried out and sobbed. Surviving in the dark while being chased by Cannibal Moths drove him crazy!</p>

  <p>"Everyone, try your best to get close. After Lincoln opens the underground palace's gate, we can retreat into the underground palace,"</p>

  <p>Adrian uttered in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Adrian wasn't that powerful when compared to the Hou brothers, and his strength wasn't even worth mentioning. However, he was the calmest since he and Luo Luo Zheng were well aware of their current situation. They might have a chance to live if they managed to calm down. Being scared wouldn't help and would just make things worse.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Adrian's words, Ab added, "Everyone, gather over here!"</p>

  <p>While the Cannibal Moths were small, they naturally comprehended the Dark Law. They seemed to be unbeatable and resistant to any damage as they flew effortlessly in the dark.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng didn't gather with the rest of them. He grabbed Freya's hand instead and felt her trembling slightly. "Don't be nervous.</p>

  <p>Follow me," he whispered.</p>

  <p>Freya nodded, but remained silent. She was afraid that she would uncontrollably scream out loud if she opened her mouth...</p>

  <p>Thanks to Luo Zheng's magical eyes, he could see everything in the darkness even if the surroundings was like a black hole.</p>

  <p>As more droplets of Nether Water dripped down from above, the number of moths increased. They flapped towards their surroundings and covered them in a dense mesh.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could only rely on his own vision to save Freya from the moths' attacks. However, time was ticking and the entire space would soon be filled with the Cannibal Moths. But Luo Luo Zheng still had another treasure? the token with the word 'mountain'. He could use the token to summon the Immortal Mansion, and then take Freya there.</p>

  <p>Freya didn't know that Luo Luo Zheng had such a marvelous token. Thus, she thought that if even those Spirit Supreme Realm warriors couldn't resist the Cannibal Moths, she was even more helpless. Until then, she could only rely on Luo Luo Zheng, so she held his hand to ease the fear in her heart.</p>

  <p>"Lincoln, have you opened the door yet?" Luo Luo Zheng gripped Freya's hand as well and slowly retreated into the darkness. His eyes looked up at the Nine-head Snake's statue. Luckily, the Cannibal Moths didn't spread out to that direction. If they did and also blocked Lincoln's way, Lincoln might not open the underground palace's door.</p>

  <p>Lincoln also knew that something unexpected had happened outside, but he was currently using the method he learned from the man in the Villain World to open the underground palace gate. He couldn't afford to be distracted now. He could only anxiously say, "Wait a moment..."</p>

  <p>"We can't wait anymore! Why are you so slow even when you're opening the door?" Ab couldn't help but curse in the dark. He never expected to encounter such strange insects there, and he had lost three of his brothers in the blink of an eye!</p>

  <p>Just as the last curse slipped out of his lips, they heard another miserable scream in the dark. Clearly, another person had been taken by the Cannibal Moths.</p>

  <p>The moment they heard the scream, Ab angrily punched the air and sent the next person flying.</p>

  <p>"Ab, that's Gil!" Baal said angrily. "If I don't do that, we're all going to die!" Ab coldly shot back.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt their hearts sink into despair as they kept backing away.</p>

  <p>However, the Cannibal Moths were everywhere.</p>

  <p>They didn't know if retreating was the right choice, but they all did it on instinct.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, it was much easier on Luo Zheng's side. He could see the distribution of the Cannibal Moths, so he was able to avoid attracting them as much as possible as he carefully dragged Freya along. He had managed to dodge three or four groups of Cannibal moths now, but the dripping sounds continued, which meant more Cannibal Moths had hatched, and there was less space for Luo Luo Zheng and Freya to retreat.</p>
