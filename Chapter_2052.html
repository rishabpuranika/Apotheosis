<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2052 Stall For Time (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The expression on Wynn's face remained calm. With a light stomp on the Dark Star, he moved like the wind. After his withered fingers lightly tapped on the air, an invisible force spread out...</p>

  <p>The world lords from Sacred race noticed that the situation was unfavorable. Just as they were about to employ the Grand Teleportation technique to flee from the scene, they discovered that the entire space had been locked down. There was no way to use the Grand Teleportation technique in this supreme world! Escape would be tough for their low levels of cultivation.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>The invisible force instantly crushed the dozens of world lords of the Sacred race present. They didn't even have the time to scream before all of them had perished! Corpses were all that was left after Wynn's attack.</p>

  <p>After he murdered the weak world lords, Wynn didn't linger in the area.</p>

  <p>He stepped out, instantly left the supreme world, and flew towards the center of the universe. The Sunflower Water World was his planned destination, so he rushed towards there.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race were hidden in the Sunflower Water World. At that moment, Wynn wanted to use the Star Sealing Technique to seal the Sunflower Water World. If he didn't do that, then it would be impossible for Wynn to kill all of the Supreme Lords within a short period. After all, it was easy for a Supreme Lord to cross over several supreme worlds through the Grand Teleportation technique and escape.</p>

  <p>When Wynn sealed the passageway, the Sacred race had also begun to take action.</p>

  <p>After Maha died, a shadow of a massive altar descended into the Sunflower Water World...</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The enormous altar, which had initially been just a shadow, had begun to reveal itself. It was suddenly located in the center of the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz…"</p>

  <p>A circle of fire suddenly burned in the center of the altar. Bright flames immediately lit up the entire altar.</p>

  <p>At the center of the altar was a wide well. A circle of flames burned furiously around it. At the same time, a strange and eccentric song echoed from the altar. The mysterious sound instantly spread throughout the Sunflower Water World. Zheng, who wasn't too far away from the altar, could hear it clearly.</p>

  <p>"That altar is summoning something in the well!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed with urgency as he grasped the Great Weighty Sword more tightly. A hint of worry was reflected in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Even in the eyes of the True Gods and Holy Beings, the Sacred race was very mysterious. Their power and abilities were enigmatic. Both Murphy and Bromley, Zheng's master, studied the Sacred race. That was why the Sacred warriors appeared in the test of the True Path in the fairy palace...</p>

  <p>"Aroo!"</p>

  <p>A monster with the head of a chicken and body of a snake drilled out from deep within the well in the center of the altar. As the monster roared, the Space Law in the Sunflower Water World seemed to become more chaotic. Zheng also became unable to employ the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>The monster with the chicken's head and snake-like body had such a mysterious ability, which seemed similar to Maha's Grand World Technique, but they were still essentially different. Maha had directly changed the laws within. However, the monster was unable to change the Law Power. Instead, it made the laws stay in a chaotic state so that the laws could not be used.</p>

  <p>The flames on the altar continued to burn as the mysterious song persistently reverberated throughout the land. As the song echoed, monsters were relentlessly summoned in the altar.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>As a fierce roar rang out, the entire altar began to shake. Afterward, a monster rushed out of the altar with great speed. It was a monster with the head of a tiger and the body of a bull. Dark red wings grew from its back while long sharp spikes decorated its body like a hedgehog.</p>

  <p>Violence and ferocity were apparent from its wild expression.</p>

  <p>The moment the monster rushed out of the altar, it pounced towards Zheng without the slightest hesitation! Savage eyes accompanied the monster's feral appearance.</p>

  <p>Zheng was unable to determine the grade of the monster, but the pressure it gave him was immense. A strong sense of crisis arose in his heart as if this monster was even more formidable than a Supreme Lord. Its powerful claws showcased its destructive strength!</p>

  <p>If he were faced with a Supreme Lord, Zheng could just cut off his opponent's Heavenly Destiny by means of the Causality Breaking Light...</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was unable to use the Causality Breaking Light to kill the beasts of remote ages summoned by Supreme Lord Denzel through the altar. Zheng had only managed to cultivate the Profound Cause-eliminating Technique at the current stage. His current level would make his attacks ineffective towards the monsters.</p>

  <p>Those beasts of remote ages were born from a cause, and they were actually regarded as the "effect". Zheng needed to master the Profound Effect-eliminating Technique first so that he could possess the power to exterminate the monstrous beasts.</p>

  <p>Just as the monster with the tiger's head and bull's body was about to pounce towards Zheng, its attack was stopped!</p>

  <p>A thin and small figure suddenly appeared in the sky and directly in front of Zheng. He quickly stepped on the monster. Within a blink of an eye, the monster was trampled into pieces!</p>

  <p>"So powerful!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat. When he saw clearly who the figure was, Zheng recognized that he was actually the head of the Celestial Position race, who carried an Evolution Lotus Flower!</p>

  <p>The head of the Celestial Position race, Master Feng, chuckled with arrogant eyes. "The monster with a tiger's head and the one with a chicken's head are two of the four legendary vicious beasts of the Sacred race. However, they are not that powerful at all!"</p>
