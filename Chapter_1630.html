<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng finished speaking, Malachi was slightly perplexed, and his sharp eyes, which were as slender as willow leaves, were clouded with confusion.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng's words had come out of the blue.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he realized what Luo Zheng was saying, his entire body suddenly shook, his eyes filling with a strong killing intent.</p>

  <p>"You are  Luo Zheng Luo!"</p>

  <p>Malachi was the only son of Supreme Lord Gunter!</p>

  <p>Although the Demon Night members were all born strong warriors, they were quite weak when it came to reproduction. That was the main factor that restricted the development of the Demon Night race. Even though Supreme Lord Gunter had many wives, he only had a single descendant, and that was Malachi.</p>

  <p>His father's death had been a huge blow to him.</p>

  <p>Now that he'd learned that the young man standing in front of him was the one who had killed his father, he realized that he was facing off against his sworn enemy.</p>

  <p>Although he had never seen Luo Zheng before, he had already imagined countless times in his mind what his enemy was like and he had sworn that he would kill Luo Zheng with his own hands in this lifetime!</p>

  <p>However, he had never thought that he would encounter Luo Zheng in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>"No way! That guy is Luo Zheng?!"</p>

  <p>"You mean the guy that killed the four Supreme Lords?"</p>

  <p>"By the way, the stories he told through the Roaring Token are really quite interesting�"</p>

  <p>"This is going to be exciting! Luo Zheng is a warrior of the Soul Sea Realm, so it's not surprising that he has entered the Illusion Battlefield. We're so lucky to see him here."</p>

  <p>"I want to know just how strong this fellow is since he has the ability to kill Supreme Lords."</p>

  <p>When Zheng's identity was revealed, it immediately caused heated discussions among the warriors watching from the city walls.</p>

  <p>A while ago, everyone had seen this as a fight between two powerful warriors. But most of them had bet on Malachi to win since they were confident that Malachi would make his opponents suffer with his superior strength.</p>

  <p>But after finding out that Malachi's opponent was the famous Luo Zheng, their views had completely changed. They felt like the tables had turned.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was a legendary warrior. Although his strength was nothing extraordinary, he enjoyed a fame that was perhaps even greater than that of some of the Supreme Lords!</p>

  <p>Although there were only 128 Supreme Lords in the supreme worlds, many martial artists could not name all of them. However, when it came to Luo Zheng... It was impossible for them not to know him because this fellow had used the Roaring Token to bombard their ears for six whole years!</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am  Luo Zheng Luo." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Killing Mu Ning immediately soared from Malachi's body. The killing Mu Ning condensed into a demon-like form in the air.</p>

  <p>"I really didn't expect to meet you in the Illusion Battlefield!" Malachi said as he stared firmly at Luo Zheng. His eyes were filled with killing intent as if he wanted to directly pierce through Luo Zheng with them. "Unfortunately, this is the Illusion Battlefield. I can't kill you in the real sense�"</p>

  <p>Although the killing intent in his eyes was strong, the expression on his face was extremely cautious.</p>

  <p>Some people said that Luo Zheng had only relied on that mysterious fairy palace to achieve what he was now, and without that, he was just an ordinary warrior who had ascended from the Lower World.</p>

  <p>But Malachi had disregarded such rumors as soon as he'd heard them.</p>

  <p>'Since this fairy palace possesses the ability to kill Supreme Lords, its legacies aren't something to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>Just now when Luo Zheng was in the main city, he already knew that I am Supreme Lord Gunter's son, but he didn't tell me his identity. Instead, he exposed his identity after we came out of the main city. It's obvious that he thought that if he'd exposed his identity when we were in the city, I would be afraid and refuse to come out of the main city to fight with him.</p>

  <p>Does that mean that I should be actually scared of him? Is he that confident that he has the ability to kill me?'</p>

  <p>As these thoughts flashed in his mind, Malachi quickly analyzed the situation.</p>

  <p>He wasn't a brainless person, otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to become an ace talent. Even the son of a Supreme Lord had to rely on his own talent and hard work if he wanted to become an ace talent of his race.</p>

  <p>Therefore, although many of the sons of the Supreme Lords in the universe had outstanding talent, they hadn't been able to become ace talents.</p>

  <p>The malicious Mu Ning that had emitted from Malachi and loomed in the air like a demon gradually dissipated.</p>

  <p>Although Malachi's malicious Mu Ning was strong, he did not rely on it to face his enemies. It was only a way for him to vent his emotions.</p>

  <p>After he calmed down, the malicious Mu Ning from his body dissipated completely. He appeared very composed now.</p>

  <p>Although he could not actually kill Luo Zheng in the Illusion Battlefield, he knew that this fight would be a rehearsal because the real battle between him and Luo Zheng would happen sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"You... are very confident.</p>

  <p>It's a good thing to have self-confidence. For a warrior who wants to cultivate martial arts, the most important quality to have is a strong warrior spirit.</p>

  <p>However, it's foolish to be over-confident!"</p>

  <p>Malachi's calm face revealed a cold smile. With a flick of his fingers, two pointed spearheads shot out of his space ring.</p>

  <p>It was a spear with a strange shape.</p>

  <p>Two snake-like forms, one black and one white, were coiled together to form the shaft of the spear. They wound all the way to the top, where they separated to form two spearheads.</p>

  <p>It was a double-pointed spear with two spearheads.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng focused his gaze on this spear with a unique double helix structure, his brows furrowed slightly.</p>

  <p>A black and white double helix double-pointed spear�</p>

  <p>He remembered hearing about something like this from Xun.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, be careful. That is the Saint Killing Spear of the Demon Night,"</p>

  <p>Hailey, who was on top of the city wall, warned in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Hailey wasn't the only one who had recognized the spear. When the other warriors of the Demon Night saw it, their expressions became incomparably solemn.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear...</p>

  <p>It was the strongest weapon of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, the Demon Night had passed it down from one deserving warrior to another. Throughout the years, it had stayed within the top ten ranks of the Universe Spirit Tablet without ever dropping in rank.</p>

  <p>This Saint Killing Spear didn't belong to any specific person, not even to Xun. But according to the rules of the Demon Night, Xun was the only one who had the right to use this Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>But now, Malachi had brought it into the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>The many members of the Demon Night sighed internally.</p>

  <p>In the past, this sort of thing would never have happened.</p>

  <p>After the Illusion Battlefield opened, many ace talents had indeed borrowed the supreme divine weapons of their races to help them in their battles. For example, Jeffrey had borrowed the Buddha Curse Blade.</p>

  <p>After all, it was only a projection of the Buddha Curse Blade, so there was no way it could be lost or damaged.</p>

  <p>However, the Saint Killing Spear was not just a supreme divine weapon; Like the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer, it was also a symbol of the supreme identity of the queen of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer was a symbol of the Queen of Punishment, while the Saint Killing Spear was a symbol of the Queen of Killings.</p>

  <p>How could such a treasure be lent to an ace talent?</p>

  <p>"Alas, the current Demon Night� is too reckless�"</p>

  <p>"Ever since Yao made the move to attack Xun, the Demon Night race has barely had any respect for the rules."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, the top leaders are the ones who set the rules, and they can change them whenever they want," some of the Demon Night members who were watching from the top of the city wall couldn't help but sigh.</p>

  <p>Malachi gripped the Saint Killing Spear tightly in his hand. He stared at Luo Zheng and said coldly, "I originally wanted to use this Saint Killing Spear to fight against the Godly Geniuses. I never thought that I would use it right now..."</p>

  <p>Right now, they were only in the first stage of the Illusion Battlefield, and the battles would only get more and more intense from here on.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he gently waved his long spear and aimed it at Luo Zheng. "You should feel proud to be facing off against such a precious weapon!"</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, Luo Zheng grinned. "It really is a great honor. But this spear doesn't seem to belong to you, does it?"</p>

  <p>"Since it is in my hands, of course it belongs to me," Malachi said proudly with his head held high. As a member of the Demon Night, of course he understood the significance of the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng stared at the spear, he pondered in his heart, 'What a pity...</p>

  <p>If I could get the Saint Killing Spear and use the reward from the Hall of Causality to make a duplicate for Xun, it would be perfect.'</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, Luo Zheng slowly took out his longsword from his space ring�the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>As he moved his longsword, the corners of his mouth slightly curled up.</p>

  <p>"Since you are so shameless to claim that the Demon Night's Saint Killing Spear is yours, then I have nothing to say�"</p>

  <p>"If you have nothing to say, then go to hell!"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Malachi attacked without any warning. Although he was confident that he could defeat Luo Zheng, he was an aloof and stubborn person.</p>

  <p>Even if he had the absolute advantage, he would still go all out, especially now that he wasn't sure of Zheng's real strength.</p>

  <p>He always favored launching surprise attacks.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear suddenly spun around in Malachi's hand, and two cold glints flashed from the two tips of the spear. Then, he thrust the spear toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A huge spear shadow appeared from the Saint Killing Spear, crazily circling in the air before shooting toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The power hidden within the spear shadow was intimidating. It was as if it could pierce through everything.</p>

  <p>This was the most basic cultivation method of the Saint Killing Spear� Shadowy Spin.</p>

  <p>"Be careful!" Janet exclaimed from the top of the city wall.</p>
