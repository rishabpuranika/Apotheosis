<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Terror flashed across the Evil God's face as the woman in black dress exposed his secret.</p>

  <p>The existence of the Rebirth Land was a fetter and a form of protection to the Evil God at the same time.</p>

  <p>But if the Rebirth Land could be so easily destroyed, this protection would become a white elephant.</p>

  <p>"Just try and kill me if you can!" the Evil God sneered.</p>

  <p>He was a formidable man, aloof to the thought of life and death. After all, he had few things to worry about.</p>

  <p>The woman sized up the Evil God, a beginner in the Other Shore Realm, with a wide smile on her face.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, I will satisfy you," the woman said, still smiling.</p>

  <p>She brought up her fingertips to his face, gently touching his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Wait," the Evil God stopped her.</p>

  <p>"Afraid of death?" she said scornfully.</p>

  <p>She had seen many people act like this. They appeared impassioned, even cocky, before death came. But once it came, they got cold feet. This man before her might also be a wimp.</p>

  <p>The Evil God snorted. "I've already killed that monster. Can I have your name?"</p>

  <p>The woman was stunned. But she recovered soon enough and said, a smile growing on her lips, "My name is Shera.".</p>

  <p>The Evil God closed his eyes at the name. He didn't look terrified even though he was about to face death.</p>

  <p>A ghastly-looking death aura then sprawled from her fingertips. It wasn't long before the Evil God stiffened and fell into a daze.</p>

  <p>He was an amazing talent, full of an irascible perversity. He should belong to the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>She wouldn't kill him, obviously.</p>

  <p>She lifted the Evil God while she stared at the leader of the Nineteenth Cave Humans some distance away with her striking eyes.</p>

  <p>The leader's heart skipped a beat when he met her gaze.</p>

  <p>But she merely began walking, and then gained speed before she galloped upwards.</p>

  <p>The leader heaved a long sigh of relief once she left with the Evil God.</p>

  <p>If the horrible man was an existence that they could not provoke, then the woman was an existence they dared not have eye contact with.</p>

  <p>How could their little Nether Mountain encounter such an existence and survive?</p>

  <p>Almost all the races of the other 32 caves had died.</p>

  <p>But fortunately, the humans were fine.</p>

  <p>Although the horrible man was ferocious, he did care about people who were from the same race as him.</p>

  <p>The leader had just begun to celebrate his good fortune when suddenly, the sound of flowing water reached his ears. .</p>

  <p>The fragments of corpses and amputated limbs within the 32 caves were once again merging together into huge monsters.</p>

  <p>These monsters, armed with wings and bone blades, wrapped in sinister deathly energy, swarmed towards the leader and the nineteenth cave.</p>

  <p>A loud thump sounded.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was thrown onto the deck of the ghost ship, his limbs flailing like a dead animal's.</p>

  <p>The "bamboo pole" stared at the Evil God before he sighed, "There are 29 layers of Ways-blending Energy. If he has really comprehended it by himself, he truly possesses a remarkable power of perception."</p>

  <p>"He has probably mastered it on his own. He'd rather die than take a master," Shera said.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that he is reluctant to take someone as his master. But most people with great talents act like this," the "bamboo pole" said. He paused for a second before asking, "Are you planning to turn him into a puppet, or do you have other plans?"</p>

  <p>Shera responded with a smile, "I want him to join the Black Ship."</p>

  <p>The man looked dazed before he recovered enough to ask rather breathily,</p>

  <p>"Are you crazy?"</p>

  <p>"There has been a vacancy on the Black Ship since one of us was killed by the Snake Goddess race," she said, leaning against the railings and pressing her arms around a skeleton. "The captain is bound to agree."</p>

  <p>"There's no way he could join us even if he's insanely talented. He's too weak," the "bamboo pole" murmured, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"That's none of your concern. I have my own ways," she said flatly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God now had nothing to offer to the Black Ship, but that didn't mean he wouldn't be of use sometime in the future.</p>

  <p>The Black Ship did not belong to any kind of super forces. It even had conflicts with most super forces in the Source World, which was why they weren't able enough to sift and pick talents from all around the Source World. It had become difficult to reinforce the Black Ship with newcomers.</p>

  <p>To Shera's satisfaction, the Evil God was perfect for that vacancy.</p>

  <p>"You can explain this to the captain yourself," the "bamboo pole" said, no longer against her decision but not comfortable with talking to the captain about it either.</p>

  <p>The ship sailed away and soon disappeared as the death aura spread around it.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the Nether Mountain, everything was restored to calm after a length of chaos, leaving only a smell of blood drifting with the wind.</p>

  <p>Another month passed.</p>

  <p>Zheng asked Trish to take the Sword-reading Liquid to the bottom of the mountain again. He also got some news from her when she returned.</p>

  <p>Gant had finally won himself a chance to go up the mountain from Sellers.</p>

  <p>But he had been stranded halfway up the mountain.</p>

  <p>Apart from glowing recommendations, one's strength was also a major factor in helping them conquer the mountain. It was obvious that Gant wasn't qualified enough.</p>

  <p>Over the past month, Zheng had spent most of his time studying the Flow Strike. He had comprehended it and discovered that the Flow Strike was not as simple as he had thought it was.</p>

  <p>It was true that the cultivation of the Emotion Closing Godly Way could be the foundation of the Flow Strike, but there was a great gap between them.</p>

  <p>Comprehending the Flow Strike required calmness. It didn't matter that he had reached the tenth floor of the Flow Tower. He had only been able to grasp a small part of the Flow Strike in a month.</p>

  <p>He couldn't be fully occupied with cultivating the Flow Strike. Improving his cultivation level on the Other Shore was equally important. He believed that the other disciples of the Flow Sword Sect would also invest some time to the Other Shore apart from having fun in their houses.</p>

  <p>On the first day of the month, Zheng chose to cultivate in seclusion.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng entered the Other Shore with his physical body after burning himself with fire.</p>

  <p>The last time around, he had wanted to explore the Sacred Mallow Temple thoroughly, but had been interrupted by the Sun Crow race's intrusion into the Blue Cloud City. He could now explore it. Fully and at his will.</p>

  <p>Zheng was now on a beach with golden sand.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a good time yet to break through to the Other Shore, so there was no Soul of Light on this beach.</p>

  <p>He looked around as he walked on.</p>

  <p>The topography of Stage One of the Other Shore was pretty simple. Zheng could easily find his way to the Sacred Mallow Temple based on his memory.</p>

  <p>On his way, Zheng remembered the Shade Stone that was inside his body.</p>

  <p>Since the Shade Stone had been melted into one with him, and his body had already entered the Other Shore, had this stone been brought here too?</p>

  <p>As far as Zheng knew, it was difficult to bring external objects out of the Source World into the Other Shore. Only two kinds of things could be taken into the Other Shore. One was the soul pill, and the other was the Other Shore Key.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Zheng tried to manifest the Shade Stone on his arm.</p>

  <p>"No reaction," he murmured, shaking his head and smiling.</p>

  <p>He had underestimated the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>If it really was so simple, so many creatures in the Source World wouldn't have had to risk so much to cross the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Zheng decided to leave this attempt behind and resumed his journey. It was not long before the Sacred Mallow Temple came into view.</p>
