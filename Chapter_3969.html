<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>About a hundred miles away from Zheng, many creatures hung on the vines.</p>

  <p>Their bodies had strange shapes and they dangled from the vines entangling the trees.</p>

  <p>The lower part of their bodies was shaped like half a gourd. On the upper half were hard bones bending upwards, with golden manes falling from the end of the bones.</p>

  <p>The hard bones were bows, and the manes were bowstrings. These short creatures were called Arrow Demons.</p>

  <p>They took out many green arrows, and without any hesitation, started shooting them out.</p>

  <p>The vine next to the leader of the Arrow Demons had already borne a huge fruit. The fruit looked exactly like an eyeball, with the white sclera and a pupil in the middle. This vine with an eye-shaped fruit was called the Heavenly Eye Vine.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Eye Vine bore a fruit that functioned much better than a normal human eye. It had good eyesight that could see ten thousand miles away.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan said that the Arrow Demons used the Shadow Marks to lock them, but its assumption was not completely right. The Arrow Demons also used the eyeball. After they found Zheng and his group through the Shadow Marks, it was the eyeball that detected them.</p>

  <p>All the Arrow Demons attacked according to what their leader saw.</p>

  <p>The relationship between the Arrow Demons and the Heavenly Eye Vine was the same as that of the Misty River race and the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>They relied on each other to live.</p>

  <p>"The Green Willow Arrows don't work on him. He has a very powerful body; no wonder he was able to kill Hawley," the leader of the Arrow Demons muttered. He saw Zheng move so quickly even as arrows were shot one after another. They didn't stop or slow him down.</p>

  <p>The leader's face darkened as he issued an order, "Use the Jade Bone Arrows!"</p>

  <p>Hearing the leader's order, the Arrow Demons felt their hearts sink, but they still turned around. They forcefully pulled out the black hard bones extending from their gourd-like bodies.</p>

  <p>The process of pulling out the hard bones was excruciating. Some of the Arrow Demons could not help but scream as blood spurted out.</p>

  <p>After they had drawn the hard bones from their bodies, black gas began to fume from the bones. They then placed the hard bones on the bows. These bones turned out to be the Jade Bone Arrows that the leader had mentioned.</p>

  <p>Every Arrow Demon would grow six black jade bones in their lifetime, and these bones could not be renewed. If all six bones were pulled out, the Arrow Demons would die.</p>

  <p>In other words, they were shooting the Jade Bone Arrows at the risk of their lives.</p>

  <p>Generally, the Arrow Demons were to use the Jade Bone Arrows when facing a deadly enemy.</p>

  <p>However, the reward Slade offered, namely the Bone Fragments Secret Soul, was too tempting. The targets happened to pass by the Arrow Demons' territory, so they were determined not to let them go.</p>

  <p>Under the command of the leader, all the Jade Bone Arrows were shot simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the leader let out a long and loud roar.</p>

  <p>"Woo!"</p>

  <p>All the Jade Bone Arrows came to a stop, suspended in the air.</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>A strange shadow began to appear on one end of the Jade Bone Arrows.</p>

  <p>It was a ferocious beast's head, covered with cyan skin, with fangs extending from its snout.</p>

  <p>The Arrow Demons had Feather Ghosts' unique bloodline. When the Jade Bone Arrows shot out, the leader had activated their bloodline theurgy.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the leader's voice shrilled, the long arrows with the Feather Ghosts' heads wailed all over the sky. They shot towards Zheng and his group about a hundred miles away.</p>

  <p>When the Arrow Demons shifted to use the Jade Bone Arrows, the rain of green arrows halted.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng did not slow down. The Arrow Demons shot so many arrows towards him; he decided not to let them go.</p>

  <p>"Why do the Arrow Demons stop after only three rounds of attacks?"</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"This is not their way of doing things," Yasamin said as she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"They are not a powerful race in the Grand Pure Realm. The reason why they gain a foothold in it is that they have very powerful arrows. It is said that these arrows are shot at the expense of their lives..."</p>

  <p>As the Snake Goddess spoke, the Augury Dog barked fiercely again.</p>

  <p>He would remind them immediately whenever he sensed any danger, but this time, his bark had become wilder.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng saw a large group of black dots floating from the distance. They looked like heads with sharp pointed teeth.</p>

  <p>"Be careful, Zheng. Those are the Jade Bone Arrows," the Primeval Lord of Heaven in Zheng's mind reminded.</p>

  <p>Although Yasamin, the Snake Goddess, and Fuxi had heard of the Arrow Demons before, they had never provoked them. They didn't know much about the Jade Bone Arrows.</p>

  <p>"Are they that powerful?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"They are arrows shot at the cost of the Arrow Demons' lives. They can directly kill their opponents, same as Gerald's Corroding Purple Rain," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained.</p>

  <p>There was a theurgy in the life truth called the Corroding Purple Rain, which was used as a weapon to kill. When the rain fell, it corroded several provinces, eating away all the lives in them.</p>

  <p>In the battle against the Pear Hill, Gerald's opponents were the masters at the Eternal Realm. They were strong and thus unafraid that the raindrops could corrode their lives.</p>

  <p>However, the Jade Bone Arrows were different. On one hand, they were more powerful than the Corroding Purple Rain; on the other hand, they killed a certain target in unison, unlike the scattered Corroding Purple Rain.</p>

  <p>While the group learned the characteristics of the Jade Bone Arrows, the Jade Bone Arrow in front of them shot towards the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Almost faster than lightning, Zheng grabbed it with his right hand.</p>

  <p>He then exerted a powerful force, crushing the Jade Bone Arrow into tiny pieces. However, the Feather Ghost attached to the arrow had bitten into his arm, leaving a small mark.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Feather Ghost's head disappeared. Zheng felt cold rushing through his body as if something had vanished together with the Feather Ghost's head.</p>

  <p>Before long, he realized that his life energy was deteriorating.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, are you okay?" The Snake Goddess keenly sensed that the arrow was not simple.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm fine."</p>

  <p>Zheng was confident in his life energy and didn't dwell on it too much.</p>

  <p>Facing the dense Jade Bone Arrows, he waved his arms that were thirty feet long and as wide as a wooden bucket.</p>

  <p>The Jade Bone Arrows had their own consciousness. They still targeted the Snake Goddess and Eastern Emperor Taiyi on Zheng's shoulders. However, when the arrows were damaged, the Feather Ghosts' heads could only attack whoever was nearby.</p>

  <p>In a flash, Zheng had destroyed dozens of bone arrows, resulting in more Feather Ghosts' heads biting his arms.</p>

  <p>Every time a Feather Ghost's head disappeared, he felt his body slowly turn cold, almost like a portion of his life energy was also being taken away.</p>

  <p>At first, there hadn't been a noticeable change in his body, but as he shattered more and more bone arrows, his body finally revealed signs of decline.</p>

  <p>Wrinkles and black spots were gradually developing on his originally bright and powerful body surface.</p>

  <p>For only a short time, Zheng had grown from a young man to a middle-aged man, and then to an old man.</p>
