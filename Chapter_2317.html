<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2317 Fusing Internal Momentum </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Once the figure in the clouds slashed a hundred thousand times, everything in the Secret Time Room disappeared right before Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>The Secret Time Room returned to darkness, as if nothing had ever happened.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't in much of a hurry to leave the Secret Time Room. He continued standing quietly and without moving in the darkness.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for Luo Zheng to completely absorb the three thousand Divine Dao with the Infinity Ruler in such a short period of time. Even if the figure slashed one hundred thousand times, Luo Zheng still couldn't exactly comprehend the strikes, because he didn't understand the many of the different kinds of internal momentum contained in them.</p>

  <p>That said, the Secret Time Room hadn't taught Luo Zheng any theurgies, instead, it only offered him a new way of thinking.</p>

  <p>'The method is to fuse the Divine Dao!' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Indeed, there really were people who could fuse two or even three kinds of Divine Dao together. However, this was only a technique put in place in order to make good use of each Divine Dao's strength as well as to allow different Divine Dao to complement each other. Many Divine Dao clashed with each other though, and fusing hundreds of different kinds of Divine Dao was simply unheard of! The reason for the latter was because there was no second person throughout all in the divine land that possessed such an ability! It was safe to say that the Secret Time Room was truly amazing.</p>

  <p>'Can I fuse them?' Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>As of right now, Luo Zheng had a total of three hundred and seven types of Divine Dao in his body. He figured there was no harm in giving it a try.</p>

  <p>As this thought came to mind, streams of chaotic energy were continuously being drawn out from the chaotic sea. They flowed along the faint light and began to gather on the scales of the Godly Tile. The internal momentum coming from all sorts of Divine Dao began to slowly seep and spread out.</p>

  <p>Elementary Fire Divine Dao...</p>

  <p>Tortoise Divine Dao...</p>

  <p>Purple Aura Divine Dao...</p>

  <p>Snow Divine Dao...</p>

  <p>Murdering Divine Dao...</p>

  <p>Parting Water Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Each scale only absorbed a small amount of the chaotic energy. Thus, in turn, the quantity of internal momentum produced wasn't very much, either.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum coming from more than three hundred Divine Dao varied. As the different kinds of internal momentum slowly entangled with each other, the colors began to oscillate on a continual basis, almost like dancing light. In the end, it turned into black-brown, a color similar to that of chaos energy!</p>

  <p>"What a surprise! It went well. I don't know if it'll really work or not..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>The process of fusing the internal momentum had gone very smoothly, which was beyond any of Luo Zheng's expectation. After fusing the internal momentum of all Divine Dao, Luo Zheng quietly extracted it.</p>

  <p>As soon as he began extracting the fused internal momentum, Luo Zheng immediately noticed that some of the energy was surging out widely.</p>

  <p>The energy was so violent that the moment it escaped his cinnabar field, it resembled a wild, running horse rampaging within his body.</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>A serious of muffled sounds could be heard coming from Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a sweet and fishy taste quickly filled Luo Zheng's throat and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His body weakened unexpectedly and he actually fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" Master Evil asked, with concern. He had no idea what Luo Zheng had just done.</p>

  <p>Moments ago, Master Evil had been hiding in Luo Zheng's mind. When he heard what Reginald had said, he roughly understood what this Secret Time Room was.</p>

  <p>In the divine land existed a stone known as the Epiphany Stone, which could help cultivators enter the best state and obtain the most suitable inspiration for breaking through to higher levels. It was said that someone had comprehended a wonderful token through the Epiphany Stone because the cultivator had seen a few illusions within it.</p>

  <p>That said though, the Epiphany Stone was incomparable to the Secret Time Room. When looking at the two, it was clear that the Secret Time Room was much more advanced. In fact, it could directly create the most suitable period of time for any cultivator.</p>

  <p>Master Evil had previously guessed what kind of scene Luo Zheng would experience. What he had never expected was that Luo Zheng would observe how the divine land came into existence.</p>

  <p>He knew Luo Zheng's origin and he knew he was an extraordinary warrior. In spite of that, he still wondered what kind of cultivation method this guy had practiced that required him to comprehend the divine land's origins.</p>

  <p>Master Evil could clearly see that Luo Zheng had indeed comprehended something, and he was looking forward to his achievements. Of course, he didn't expect that Luo Zheng would suffer from internal injury not long after it showed sighs that he had made some progress.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I'm fine. Only my internal organs are shattered..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took out a snow-white pill and swallowed it at once. He had retrieved this pill from the pill refining room in case of future need. After consuming it, a cool sensation spread throughout his entire body, and his internal organs began recovering rapidly.</p>

  <p>As he gritted his teeth, he slowly got himself up from the ground.</p>

  <p>The method provided by the Time Secret Room could possibly work. He hadn't considered how violent the fused internal momentum would be.</p>

  <p>Before even drawing it out, he had already lost control.</p>

  <p>'The Divine Dao fused by the figure were selective. Perhaps he has avoided a few Divine Dao that clash with each other. I didn't filter out the clashing Divine Dao, and fused all of them. The repellent power of internal momentum is too strong, so the fused internal momentum is too violent and difficult to control!' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>After failing the first time, Luo Zheng didn't give up or feel discouraged.</p>

  <p>Instead, he started the second experiment, and the third...</p>

  <p>Many of the True Gods had gained some insights in the Secret Time Room. And every time, once they came out, their faces revealed a trace of excitement that they couldn't control.</p>

  <p>With a look of arrogance on his face, Langston stood at the door of the Secret Time Room and waited. A short while later, Liusu came out of the Secret Time Room with a shocking expression on her face, as if she had witnessed an incredible scene while she was inside.</p>

  <p>"Liusu, how are you doing? Are you okay?" Langston asked.</p>

  <p>"Fine," replied Liusu indifferently.</p>

  <p>"That's good to hear!" Langston smiled back and said, "I've also gained a lot from this place. I feel as though I can break through to become a top-rank True God at any time now!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, good for you," Liusu nodded, as she looked inadvertently at the Secret Time Room where Luo Zheng was staying.</p>

  <p>As Langston took notice of Liusu's reaction, his face darkened and turned grim.</p>

  <p>This whole time, Liusu had secretly kept an eye on Luo Zheng. In fact, Langston had noticed this before, but he simply restrained his anger.</p>

  <p>After all, he was a proud man, how could he even bear this?</p>

  <p>As Liusu repeatedly paid attention to Luo Zheng, the killing intent in Langston's heart began to grow larger and larger.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, Luo Zheng walked out of the Secret Time Room.</p>

  <p>Although the wounds within his body had almost healed, his face was still slightly pale.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing!" Aleyna shouted.</p>

  <p>"You seem to be hurt!" Kelsey said.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng stepped out, the two girls immediately rushed toward him.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, it doesn't matter. Something wrong happened during my cultivation," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>"How is that even possible? Doesn't the Secret Time Room only provide cultivators with certain insights?" Kelsey asked, curiously.</p>

  <p>As Liusu heard what her two sisters were saying, her eyes filled with worry, but her emotion disappeared quickly. On the other hand though, it didn't escape Langston's eyes. He sneered, "He just overestimated himself and falsely thought he had actually comprehended something.</p>

  <p>He'd certainly face a few problems if he rushed to practice. Sooner or later, he will spiral into madness and die."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't say anything, but Aleyna couldn't stand it any longer. "What kind of nonsense are you even talking about?"</p>

  <p>"I'm just speaking the truth. Someone hurting themselves in the Secret Time Room, now that's a real talent. Ha-ha," Langston said, with a wry smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shot a cold glance in Langston's direction, but didn't say a word.</p>

  <p>Instead, he walked toward the Divine Time Temple's door.</p>

  <p>Being ignored by Luo Zheng in front of Liusu made Langston feel awful. If it weren't for the fact that this wasn't the place for a fight, he would have killed Luo Zheng off in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The True Gods inside the Time Divine Temple left the Secret Time Rooms one after another, and gathered in front of the door once again.</p>

  <p>The Time Ghosts were still blocking the door, and Reginald, Jolyon and a few other True Gods were discussing where to go next.</p>

  <p>"If we find a way to lure these Time Ghosts away, then we'll have a chance at entering the second stage of the Time Sea," a True God proposed.</p>

  <p>"This time though, the Time Sea is much more dangerous. The first stage is already so terrifying. Wouldn't it be courting death if we go to the second stage? I think it's probably better if we return the way we came, and leave the Time Sea Forbidden Land," another True God said.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods cherished their lives preciously, and thus, they wouldn't take such a risk.</p>

  <p>That said, a good portion of the True Gods were still very persistent. One of the True Gods said, "This forbidden land has become much more difficult than before. In the past, the forbidden land was very stable, but perhaps a few great opportunities have formed within it this time."</p>

  <p>In their opinion, the female leader of the Sun Blind race was the controller of the Time Sea Forbidden Land. Seeing as she invited them to the Astronomical Transit Day celebration, it was impossible for her to casually adjust the difficulty in the forbidden land. Now that there were so many Time Ghosts in the forbidden land, there was a higher chance that great opportunities would present themselves.</p>

  <p>The group of True Gods were discussing whether or not they were to explore further. For some time, they even quarreled over this.</p>

  <p>"Stop quarreling. Whether we leave the Divine Time Temple or not depends on Tianxing, anyway," said Reginald, as he turned his head to look at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Time Ghosts were still blocking the gate, and therefore, they could only rely on the Golden Beast Statue to lure them away. Otherwise, no one could ever leave the Divine Time Temple.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what Reginald had to say, everyone immediately fixed their gaze on Luo Zheng.</p>
