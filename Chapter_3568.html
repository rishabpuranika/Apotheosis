<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>To the second-floor disciples who didn't know Zheng, it looked as if Rocco had tolerated Zheng and was even considerate enough to not put him in an awkward situation.</p>

  <p>Zheng's insistence in challenging him only showed his ungrateful and reckless nature.</p>

  <p>Yusuf shook his head and smiled. "He came out of nowhere. He's a new disciple and has only been in the Land of Sword Grief for less than two months."</p>

  <p>"Maybe two months weren't enough for him to know the Land of Sword Grief's situation..." The disciple's words faltered when he realized something. "Wait!"</p>

  <p>This guy was ranked first on the first floor but he had only been here for two months. Did that mean it only took him two months to nab the top spot?</p>

  <p>"Two months? Are you serious, Yusuf?" he asked. The disbelief was clearly obvious on his face.</p>

  <p>Those on the second floor all had been on the first floor too. Becoming the number one fighter on the first floor was incredibly difficult, but Zheng was able to do it in two months? That was impossible! None of the disciples on the second floor could believe this.</p>

  <p>"Not in two months," Yusuf clarified.</p>

  <p>The disciples relaxed hearing this. They thought perhaps there was a misunderstanding, so they waited for Yusuf's explanation. However, what he said next shocked them even more. "On his first day entering the Land of Sword Grief, he defeated Cleon and became number one."</p>

  <p>Not two months, but only a day! Yusuf squinted at the scene below. "It doesn't really matter though. The fact remains that he wants to challenge Rocco after less than two months."</p>

  <p>A genius at Zheng's level was rare, even in the Oneness Sky Palace. He was very confident too since he dared to challenge Rocco in just a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>Where exactly did his confidence come from?</p>

  <p>Even Rocco himself was confused at Zheng's brashness. Did he have some sort of secret technique? A magical ace up his sleeves?</p>

  <p>"Rocco!" another disciple shouted from above. "Don't underestimate this guy! He ranked first on the first floor on his first day of entering the Land of Sword Grief!"</p>

  <p>This piece of information greatly cleared up all the speculation in Rocco's head.</p>

  <p>Now he understood why Zheng was so confident!</p>

  <p>"Ranking first on your first day! Outstanding," he couldn't help but remark in amazement. "There has never been such an amazing person that appeared in the Oneness Sky Palace before. Not even Libby was able to do it. That's a really outstanding feat, but I still think it's too early for you to challenge me."</p>

  <p>Rocco waved his hands and the Other Shore Power surged throughout his whole body.</p>

  <p>A strange aura emanated from him, plunging the arena into a state of intense pressure.</p>

  <p>The flash of murderous intent in his eyes did not go unnoticed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Rocco had been ranked first on the second floor for quite a long time now.</p>

  <p>He even challenged the disciples on the third floor before, but he always failed. In the earlier days, someone even had defeated him and got promoted to the third floor. Rocco knew that a talent like Zheng was also destined to reach third floor one day.</p>

  <p>The thought made him burn with jealousy.</p>

  <p>Just now, he only planned to teach Zheng a lesson, but that slight twinge of resentment made him want to kill the brat.</p>

  <p>Those watching could only stare in wide-eyed wonder at the sudden power that surged out of Rocco's body.</p>

  <p>They all knew Rocco was number one on the second floor but none of them ever expected his power to actually be this great. His power was condensed in an almost solid state of pressure, as if he could crush a person with one move.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity I can't use the ability of the Other Shore Token on the arena, otherwise I could increase my strength threefold..." Rocco murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>When Zheng felt Rocco's power, he became just a bit more serious about this challenge he was proposing. His opponent had just extracted more than five thousand divine megatons of power on a whim. Who knew what his limit was?</p>

  <p>Not only that, Rocco's Other Shore Token could even increase his strength threefold. It was fortunate that he couldn't use it in the arena.</p>

  <p>As soon as Rocco finished talking, he jumped and immediately pounced.</p>

  <p>He was determined to make the first move and didn't give Zheng any sort of warning whatsoever.</p>

  <p>He raised his hand and allowed the Other Shore Power to rush towards his right hand, forming a powerful spiral.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>This powerful fist was headed straight towards Zheng!</p>

  <p>There was no need to be stupid and try to take on Rocco's punch. Zheng immediately side-stepped and dodged.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Instead of Zheng, Rocco's fist hit the ground and made the entire arena shake violently. The array flickered momentarily, having taken the brunt of his attack.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't dodge like a coward!" Rocco exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Since you were the one to propose the challenge, you should face me like a man!"</p>

  <p>Disciples mainly competed in terms of Chaotic Source Spirits and Other Shore Power here in the arena of the Land of Sword Grief. There wasn't really any other skill to prove beside those two.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng decided not to dodge Rocco's second punch. Instead, he reached out and tried to block his fist!</p>

  <p>Rocco snickered at Zheng's chosen move.</p>

  <p>"Idiot..."</p>

  <p>He didn't think Zheng would take his words so seriously. Rocco only said that to rile him up, but it seemed to have worked since the young man was now determined to face him head-on.</p>

  <p>How could such a stupid person become number one so easily? There was no way Zheng was going to survive his explosive power now.</p>

  <p>Maybe those guys on the second floor lied to him?</p>

  <p>It didn't really matter though.</p>

  <p>Zheng was going to lose this fight after this punch.</p>

  <p>Would he die? That depended on his luck. Rocco didn't really have the time to dally with these first-floor fighters since he had to deal with the Sanskrit words. His only choice was to go all out and finish the fight as fast as possible without any heed for the consequences.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Just as he expected, Zheng had been unable to block his punch with his hands.</p>

  <p>As a result, Rocco's fist directly collided with his chest.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The force was enough to send Zheng all the way to the edge of the arena. He would've fallen, had he not stopped himself at the last moment.</p>

  <p>Any other ordinary warrior would've been pleased by this result.</p>

  <p>However, there was nothing but a serious frown on Rocco's face because he expected more.</p>

  <p>That punch should've pierced through Zheng's chest and made his internal organs collapse! However, Rocco had failed to tire out Zheng's Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Did that mean Zheng had already cultivated the Chaotic Source Spirits to the middle stage?</p>

  <p>Once the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace reached the Chaotic Source Realm, they would immediately get recruited in the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>Did Zheng also just reach the Chaotic Source Realm?</p>

  <p>Rocco looked at Zheng in confusion. "How long have you been in the Chaotic Source Realm?" he asked.</p>
