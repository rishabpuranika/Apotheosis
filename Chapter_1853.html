  <p>
</p>

  <p>"You finally stopped..."</p>

  <p>Teigan from the Collapsing Mountain race stared at Luo Luo Zheng in awe. He couldn't understand how Luo Luo Zheng was able to absorb so many drops of strength source.</p>

  <p>A quarter of the strength source in the huge lake had been absorbed by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After he stopped his absorption, Luo Luo Zheng finally opened his eyes. A shadow of a smile played on his lips as he swam towards the shore from the middle of the lake.</p>

  <p>"You... How did you absorb so much strength source?" Teigan asked, awestruck.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng winked as he said, "I drank it."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense..." Teigan whispered. He thought about how Luo Luo Zheng could have drank it.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng reversed the strength source in the lake, the strength source in the countless caves within the Sacred Spring Mountain also reversed, as well as the strength source that was originally unreachable.</p>

  <p>The strength source's features were already known to the Collapsing Mountain race, as they had protected the strength source for countless years and thus had already performed extensive research on it.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race considered the strength source as animate, which meant that after a period of time, it would be reversed. The strength source that was originally pooled on the floor would flow up to the ceiling as soon as people entered the Sacred Spring Mountain. The strength source would continue to meander along the ceiling.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the strength source, most martial artists who entered the Sacred Spring Mountain were only able to obtain a very small amount of strength source.</p>

  <p>This reversal often occurred after a martial artist had entered the mountain. There were only a handful of martial artists that managed to capture a portion of the strength source before the backflow.</p>

  <p>However, due to a lucky accident, Luo Luo Zheng had explored an undiscovered path and found the key item to control the flow of the strength source. It was the Eight-diagram Ball which he held in his hand.</p>

  <p>At that moment, in every corner of the Sacred Spring Mountain, the vast majority of martial artists were ecstatic.</p>

  <p>In a long and narrow cave, the strength source formed a stream that lazily flowed above. Three martial artists traveled together, but all they were able to do was staring at the strength source flowing above their heads, unreachable.</p>

  <p>They focused their attention more on the stone walls around the cave, as they hoped to find a few drops of strength source embedded within.</p>

  <p>Right then, the gravity of the strength source suddenly reversed. The strength source at the ceiling of the cave began to fall down like a rain shower, and caused the three martial artists to rejoice.</p>

  <p>Scenes like this were common all across the entire Sacred Spring Mountain. Other than Luo Luo Zheng and Teigan, no one had a clue why this happened. This year was destined to be a fruitful one for the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng took the Eight-diagram Ball with him when they left the lake. He looked at the remaining half of the lake filled with the strength source, feeling a little hesitant to leave.</p>

  <p>As of the moment, his inner world and body had already reached their limits, so he was unable to store any more strength source. However, he thought of the considerable amount of strength source that he would need in the future.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately stopped himself thinking about it.</p>

  <p>It was already a great opportunity when he obtained such a lucky chance to increase his own strength.</p>

  <p>If the strength source was truly the power of a Holy Being, it would be too greedy on Luo Zheng's part to take it all away.</p>

  <p>There are times when one should know when to stop. Excessive greed often has devastating repercussions. This Divine Refinement Forbidden Land emanated such a strange Mu Ning everywhere.The Holy Being that built this Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was very generous in allowing all living beings to partake of his strength source, and that was not logical.</p>

  <p>"But... How do we leave?"</p>

  <p>Teigan asked, as he returned to the original question. He looked around at their surroundings.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng ignored Teigan's words, and observed the Eight-diagram Ball in his hand.</p>

  <p>A while ago, he had twisted the white part down and caused the strength source to pour down. He now grabbed the black part and twisted it towards another direction.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As soon as the Eight-diagram Ball was activated, Luo Luo Zheng immediately felt the gravity inside the Sacred Spring Mountain reverse once again.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, what was reversed was not the strength source, but all the living beings in the Sacred Spring Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Teigan cursed. He felt the earth and sky spin, and his entire body fell directly towards the ceiling. Before he fell, he had suddenly twisted his body so he fell horizontally onto the ceiling. At least, he did not let his head hit the ceiling directly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng seemed to have been prepared for what happened. He twisted his body in the air, and stood on the ceiling.</p>

  <p>The two of them looked like bats that stood upside-down on the ceiling.</p>

  <p>But to themselves, they were standing on the ceiling because their own gravitational direction had been changed.</p>

  <p>Both of them were still doing well.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, all the warriors in the entire Sacred Spring Mountain had been reversed. There were also many powerful creatures living inside the caves that had turned around and hung on the ceiling of each cave.</p>

  <p>"What happened?!"</p>

  <p>"The gravitational force here suddenly flipped!"</p>

  <p>"Damn, I almost fell to my death!"</p>

  <p>It was Luo Zheng's favor to these warriors that they obtained a great number of the strength source. However, they also suffered a great loss because of Luo Luo Zheng now.</p>

  <p>"Now you know how to leave, right?" Luo Luo Zheng told Teigan with a smile.</p>

  <p>Since the Eight-diagram Ball changed the gravity and the narrow passageway was constructed in such a strange manner, Luo Luo Zheng had already made some assumptions. The only way he could be able to go through that passageway was if he changed his own gravity.</p>

  <p>"Get ready." Luo Luo Zheng twisted the Eight-diagram Ball in his hand once again as he finished speaking, which caused him and Teigan to fall from the ceiling.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng still landed safely on the ground; Teigan, on the contrary, once again tragically smashed down to the floor, as he had not expected Luo Zheng's sudden action. He was thankful for his strong body; otherwise, falling down from such a high altitude under such a powerful gravitational force would hurt him significantly.</p>

  <p>"Can you not move so suddenly?!" Teigan said angrily from behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I've warned you," answered Luo Luo Zheng as he walked forward with the Eight-diagram Ball.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's lead, the two of them rapidly arrived at the long and narrow passageway.</p>

  <p>The world beyond the end of the passageway was in absolute darkness, with the exception of the path that hung above their heads.</p>

  <p>"Ready?"</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng's words were spoken, Teigan's entire body tensed up as if he was about to face a powerful enemy.</p>

  <p>Seeing Teigan's expression, Luo Luo Zheng smiled a bit. "No need to be so nervous.</p>

  <p>I know this place is dangerous. I'll be careful..."</p>

  <p>Teigan had already experienced it before. This place was too deep to see the bottom, so he wasn't sure where he would fall to.</p>

  <p>When both of them were as close to the edge of the passageway as possible, Luo Luo Zheng twisted the Eight-diagram Ball in his hand again.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Gravity reversed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Teigan took a step forward simultaneously. They didn't fall down to nowhere, but landed on the narrow passageway above.</p>

  <p>This time, both of them landed safely. They walked forward upside down on the passageway.</p>

  <p>They walked along this path for two miles. The end of this passageway once again formed a fault. However, another passageway appeared below the two of them.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng switched the gravitational force again, and the two of them fell down from the passageway above into the one below.</p>

  <p>This was a very strange path. They needed to rely on this Eight-diagram Ball to constantly change the direction of gravity; sometimes downwards, sometimes upwards.</p>

  <p>When they got used to the changing gravity, they eventually relaxed.</p>

  <p>The tragic predicament of the other warriors inside the Sacred Spring Mountain was another matter.</p>

  <p>They had just started getting used to the reversed gravity when it suddenly changed. They struck against the ceiling of the cave, and when the gravity shifted once again, they smashed down ferociously. They were completely confused by the constantly changing gravity. Had the Sacred Spring Mountain gone crazy?</p>

  <p>All sorts of curses were heard throughout. However, none of them were able to change the direction of the gravitational force. They could only try their best to endure it.</p>

  <p>There were some martial artists that figured out a way to avoid being tossed about so willy-nilly. After falling down twice and realizing that the situation would repeat itself, they held tightly on stone pillars or stuck themselves in cracks.</p>

  <p>Eventually, after Luo Luo Zheng and Teigan had walked on the passageways above and below, they finally reached the end. A stone door appeared in front of the two warriors.</p>
