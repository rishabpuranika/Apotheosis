<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1564 Aurora </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The ogres' eyes turned red with fury.</p>

  <p>They had gathered as a team when they entered the Illusion Battlefield? they already managed to plunder three whole cities.</p>

  <p>Two of them could be ranked in the top 500, 000 of the entire Illusion Battlefield, and in the top 10, 000 of this supreme world.</p>

  <p>By chance, they ended up at the Deadwood Gate.</p>

  <p>Encountering such hefty resistance was completely unexpected.</p>

  <p>Even after wasting several hours on it, they were unable to push through the attacks from the Falling Leaves Array. Having lost two of their teammates, they were already beyond their limits of patience and control.</p>

  <p>After the ogre roared, a giant shield appeared on his arm. "I'll charge in front. You guys, follow me all the way. Cheer up, now! I don't think these girls will last much longer!"</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it! This is such a waste of time. What kind of treasures are on top of this damned wood?"</p>

  <p>The others also followed suit in yelling and complaining? they couldn't hold it in any longer. Their strength had already been activated, preparing to take down their enemies once and for all.</p>

  <p>On the front line, a tall woman from the Demon Night stood beside Amber.</p>

  <p>She had long, blue hair as if it was dyed by the color of the sky itself.</p>

  <p>At this moment, countless fragmented leaves surrounded Aurora's hand, much like a bracelet made of leaves.</p>

  <p>"Amber! We probably won't be able to hold on any longer," Aurora said, looking helpless.</p>

  <p>"Never mind! We'll have another chance," Amber assured her with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>But to that, Aurora frowned, deep in thought. With a flick of her fingers, the edges of all the leaves in the array began glinting with golden light.</p>

  <p>Those leaves seemed to turn sharper and fiercer. "I like your optimistic attitude. If you can obtain your freedom, then even in the Demon Night of the Upper Realm, you're sure to have a brilliant future ahead!"</p>

  <p>With that, Amber smiled? such laments from Aurora weren't new to her.</p>

  <p>But what Aurora wished for was quite a long shot. While the restrictions on the warriors of the Demon Night weren't unreasonably harsh, the order of their queen was still an iron law.</p>

  <p>Who Amber had offended was the Queen of Punishment herself? how could an ordinary warrior like her survive the grave consequences?</p>

  <p>"Those dirty bastards are coming!"</p>

  <p>"Let's go then!"</p>

  <p>Determination grew more evident on the faces of the two Demon Night women.</p>

  <p>Fighting against others had always been something to look forward to. In fact, Amber cared nothing for the Illusion Points? she wished only to stay in the Illusion Space for longer, and for time to move slower.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, she saw the ogre in the lead holding a giant shield rush toward them.</p>

  <p>Behind those ogres, a voice called out. "Looks like it's not too late!"</p>

  <p>For a moment, the ogres were stunned. When they turned their heads, their gazes fell right upon Luo Luo Zheng and they were shocked frozen.</p>

  <p>'A human warrior?'</p>

  <p>'Why would a human martial artist appear here?'</p>

  <p>A smile hung on Luo Zheng's face as he slowly walked forward? it was as if there weren't any ogres in front of him, ready to attack.</p>

  <p>"It's Vivian! She brought us some reinforcements. But why would she take that human martial artist?"</p>

  <p>Not only the ogres were puzzled? so were Aurora and the rest of the Demon Night warriors behind them.</p>

  <p>An agreement had already been made in the main city that no outsiders would be allowed to enter the Deadwood Gate. What was Vivian thinking? Obviously, this human was brought in by her.</p>

  <p>Amber's breathing suddenly quickened the moment she saw Luo Luo Zheng. Her thin sword shimmered with a faint radiance as it trembled in the air.</p>

  <p>Disbelief was shining in her eyes as they fixated on his figure.</p>

  <p>Back in the prison where she spent her punishment, Amber could often hear his voice echoing throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>This human youth ascended around the same time she did, but in only a few short years, he had already caused such a huge commotion. It made Amber marvel inwardly.</p>

  <p>When she first met Luo Luo Zheng, he was merely a war fighter.</p>

  <p>Since then, she had kept a small wish in her heart.</p>

  <p>Amber wanted to see Luo Luo Zheng rise up.</p>

  <p>She hoped Xun would rise up.</p>

  <p>That was the only way she would ever truly be saved.</p>

  <p>But as time passed, Amber came to understand that she was someone easily forgotten.</p>

  <p>The universe was extremely vast, after all.</p>

  <p>Each supreme world was unimaginably massive.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng did rise up one day and helped Xun ascend to the throne again?even if they stripped Yao of her power, so what?</p>

  <p>How could Luo Luo Zheng notice a prison in a small corner of such a vast supreme world?</p>

  <p>Obviously, it was impossible.</p>

  <p>With that in mind, Amber fell into despair.</p>

  <p>While she knew that Luo Luo Zheng was willing to help her, she couldn't leave the prison. How could she ever let him know the wish she held in her heart?</p>

  <p>Since the Illusion Battlefield was opened, all the Soul Sea Realm warriors rushed in.</p>

  <p>But never did Amber think that she'd have the chance to cross paths with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield was divided into 50 supreme worlds and the probability of her and Luo Luo Zheng being in the same one was a mere 2%.</p>

  <p>There were countless main cities in a supreme world, and trillions of martial artists in the entire Illusion Battlefield. Considering those numbers, the chance of meeting Luo Luo Zheng was, in actuality, slim to zero.</p>

  <p>But that minuscule chance seemed to make its way to her, and she found herself in a miracle.</p>

  <p>Her excitement was so overwhelming that she could barely speak.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you! You'd better scram! There's no place for you here," an ogre berated.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng continued his steps with the smile still on his face.</p>

  <p>If these ogres had looked carefully, they would have seen that his gaze hadn't actually landed on them? his eyes were completely focused on Amber.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had no idea what was going on with her recently.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, Amber was an old friend? she was of great help to him during his journey through the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>"Kill him!" the ogre with the giant shield decisively issued the order.</p>

  <p>Even from where he stood, he could feel a trace of evil radiating from the human's body. The strange feeling left him uneasy.</p>

  <p>The ogre holding a mace was the first to charge toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The thick mace flickered with a dark, metallic luster, and the teeth on it were exceptionally sharp.</p>

  <p>The ogre held it in both hands, having the forceful energy from within his body bursting out like explosives. In that instant, the impact was terrifying? it was as if he was waving an entire mountain in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Not dodging?"</p>

  <p>Beside the array, Aurora looked stunned? she was completely at a loss to what Luo Luo Zheng was planning to do.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's palm reached out and transformed into a blade force, slashing upwards diagonally.</p>

  <p>The strike wasn't particularly fast? it was even rather slow. But the hidden power in it was something no one could possibly imagine.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The collision between Luo Zheng's palm strike and the mace resounded.</p>

  <p id="top_4">At that very moment, the others' eyes widened as they sucked in a breath of cold air.</p>

  <p>The thick mace broke easily under Luo Zheng's palm.</p>

  <p>After the upper part of it shattered, it flew backward, as it dissolved into countless black fragments in the air. They scattered, causing some kind of black rainfall on the tree.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the ogre's hands holding the mace suddenly split open, spurting out brown blood.</p>

  <p>First, his fingers, then his palms and arms? by the end of it, even his shoulders were split open.</p>

  <p>And all were from a single strike of the palm.</p>

  <p>Standing behind Luo Luo Zheng was Vivian, who seemed to have two stars rising in her very eyes. This person's strength was well beyond her imagination.</p>

  <p>Although Aurora, who was of a noble background, had witnessed many extraordinary things in her life, she couldn't help but widen her eyes with great shock at witnessing the scene? she also couldn't deny the feeling of an intense threat.</p>

  <p>While she probably had some strength left over to fight the ogres, after considering Luo Zheng's strength, she felt a sense of helplessness in her heart? she was no match for him.</p>
