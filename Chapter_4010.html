<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"It's too dangerous to enter the wilderness so recklessly," Pearson immediately remarked.</p>

  <p>Thurston and Sawyer nodded in agreement.</p>

  <p>It was far beyond dangerous.</p>

  <p>To enter the wilderness carelessly was to gamble one's very life.</p>

  <p>While the three Eternal Realm Hunters were willing to follow Zheng, that didn't mean they were willing to risk their lives for him.</p>

  <p>Looking at Pearson with her eyes full of determination, the Snake Goddess said, "Of course, I won't be forcing anyone here to come along. I will enter first."</p>

  <p>It was a place of no return. As the name suggested, after one crossed the snow line, it was impossible to look back, let alone retreat.</p>

  <p>If the Snake Goddess managed to remain safe and sound in her attempt, the others' worries would be alleviated.</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you," Fuxi said.</p>

  <p>"Okay." The Snake Goddess nodded.</p>

  <p>The two Pear Hill leaders had a clear understanding of the current situation.</p>

  <p>If they really failed, then everything would be destroyed. They would die anyway? if they didn't try now, they could only live a while longer.</p>

  <p>To the Eternal Realm warriors that had lived for countless years, the period was merely a fleeting moment. It didn't mean much to them.</p>

  <p>"I'll help you kill the two Snow Scale Dragons," said Pearson.</p>

  <p>They were hidden in the snow, revealing a pair of small eyes, greedily staring at the group of people above. If Fuxi and the Snake Goddess went down, they'd definitely fall under attack.</p>

  <p>Whoosh...</p>

  <p>Jumping off the Wing King's back, Pearson rushed toward the two Snow Scale Dragons.</p>

  <p>When the two Snow Scale Dragons saw their prey approaching, their eyes flashed with greed as they rushed out of the snow with their jaws open wide.</p>

  <p>When Pearson reached the Snow Scale Dragons, his body suddenly transformed into thin threads that wrapped around them.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, Thurston and Sawyer summoned the Black Sun once again.</p>

  <p>Under its strong force of attraction, the two Snow Scale Dragons had no chance to resist? they were sucked into the Black Sun.</p>

  <p>"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."</p>

  <p>Pearson's body was outlined with thin threads before returning to its original form.</p>

  <p>When the people in black robes saw how the three Eternal Realm Hunters cooperated with each other, they exclaimed in admiration. Truly, the cooperation between the three of them was perfect.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess didn't hesitate about their plan? they didn't even offer any last words to the others.</p>

  <p>The two of them moved quickly, arriving at the snow line.</p>

  <p>The thick snow stopped there, forming a low snow slope. Under the slope lay a barren wasteland.</p>

  <p>When the two stood on the slope, they could still see Zheng's receding figure.</p>

  <p>They exchanged glances without any hint of fear in their eyes and entered where Zheng had stepped through.</p>

  <p>After crossing the snow line, the two took a few steps toward the wilderness.</p>

  <p>On the Wing King's back, the people watched their every move.</p>

  <p>'Can they turn around?'</p>

  <p>'God bless them?'</p>

  <p>'Please don't let this be a dead-end!'</p>

  <p>They all prayed fervently in their hearts.</p>

  <p>Then, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess turned around, almost in sync, and smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>Fuxi even stepped back on the snow line and said, "There is a road inside. It should be safe. Don't worry, everyone!"</p>

  <p>And so he entered the wilderness once again, moving back and forth between the two areas' boundaries.</p>

  <p>In the wilderness, the road was a stark contrast against the surrounding soil in color, but no one could see it from where they stood on the snow land? they had to enter the wilderness to figure it out.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and have a look!"</p>

  <p>Taking a small leap, Eastern Emperor Taiyi followed suit and crossed the line, landing into the wilderness, his movements as light as a swallow's.</p>

  <p>There, he looked down to find the path with a slightly dark color extending a far distance, and Zheng walked on the far end of it.</p>

  <p>Seeing how the several warriors could enter and leave freely, the three Eternal Realm Hunters let go of their psychological burden and decided to enter as well.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't actually a death trap, they were quite willing to see what was out there and offer their help.</p>

  <p>The men clad in black robes took some time to discuss and reach an agreement. Then, they silently crossed the snow line as well.</p>

  <p>In the end, only the Wing King remained in the air. His body suddenly shrank tenfold, down to ten feet in height, before he crossed the snow line and entered the wilderness.</p>

  <p>Once he did, the Snake Goddess turned around and headed back to the line, stopping to stare at it for a moment.</p>

  <p>Her fingers trembled slightly, making two crimson energy beams shoot out.</p>

  <p>With a sudden swing of her arms, the two beams detached from her and shot rapidly along the snow line on her two sides.</p>

  <p>Once thirty miles of the snow line on each side was destroyed by the beams, the Snake Goddess simply turned and left.</p>

  <p>Soon after?</p>

  <p>Two transparent balls of light floated over from the vast snow land.</p>

  <p>Inside one of them floated a slender girl? she was none other than Claire.</p>

  <p>In the other was a complete set of armor with six light wings gently dancing on its back? this was Slade.</p>

  <p>"They disappeared from here," Claire said, pointing ahead.</p>

  <p>"The snow line has been destroyed and we can't tell which path they've taken," Slade said, looking down.</p>

  <p>Claire frowned in disbelief. "What a clumsy method they're using?they're trying to deceive us into thinking they've entered the Wilderness of No Return?"</p>

  <p>Such was the name given to the place by the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>"Maybe they really have gone to the Wilderness of No Return. There's a road that opened up in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, after all," Slade concluded. He and the Snake Goddess seemed to have the same idea? every road that opened up in the Myriad Pagoda Mountains was unusual, so even the Wilderness of no Return likely had a road connected to it.</p>

  <p>Much to his surprise, Claire looked at him mockingly as she said, "I think we should let Gavyn control the Holy Wings Armor. Let all the members come out. They must be hiding in the snow land. We must find them, even if that means turning the entire land upside down!"</p>

  <p>Claire's remark made Slade fall silent.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, he held power greater than that of both Claire and Les, and his status was only second to that of the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>But there were still tens of thousands of members of the Element Spirit race inside Slade's body, each of them holding different opinions. Some believed that Zheng and his group were hiding in the snow land, while others believed that they had broken into the Wilderness of No Return.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds of silence, the discussion among the members of the Element Spirit race in his body turned into a fierce argument. Eventually, it ended with most people believing that Zheng and the others with him were all hiding in the snow land. Then, all members of the Element Spirit race of various forms emerged from the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>Following Claire's orders, the members of the Element Spirit race began an inch-by-inch search across the snow land.</p>

  <p>Two dots of gray light flashed on the Holy Wings Armor helmet? it was now being controlled by Gavyn alone.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Claire," he said in a clearly joyful tone.</p>

  <p>She threw a casual glance at him before she said, "Les is seriously injured, but he refuses to die. If you really want to take control of the armor forever, you must perform well these days."</p>

  <p>The armor held an important position in the Element Spirit Civilization. Not only was it a great honor to control it, but a manifestation of one's ability.</p>

  <p>"How well should I behave?" Gavyn asked.</p>

  <p>"Good enough that you can impress the Eye Spirit," Claire replied.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I will!" He nodded firmly.</p>

  <p>As the members of the Element Spirit race continued digging and turning over snow, some creatures were occasionally dug up, all of which were instantly killed.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, they weren't going to stop for anything until they found Zheng and his companions.</p>
