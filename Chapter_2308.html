<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I don't think that I'd be able to guess," Zheng said shaking his head helplessly. He really didn't know what theurgy could kill everyone at will.</p>

  <p>Aleyna gave the woman in white a look and said, "Don't you think she's in a strange state?"</p>

  <p>Zheng gave her a nod of approval. The woman did look as if she was in a trance and might disappear any time.</p>

  <p>"Well, she doesn't really exist in this world. She lives in time," Aleyna said through her life vitality.</p>

  <p>"She lives in time?" he asked Aleyna with a confused look on his face.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already witnessed the Time Law in the universe, but when the warriors and the True Gods used the Time Law, they could only delay the passage of time. Such was the simplest use of the Time Law.</p>

  <p>Time was quite mysterious and difficult to comprehend.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the head of the Sun Blind race can go through the Time Sea freely and change the past in any time period," Aleyna said. "In other words, she is able to trace back to any time in the entire divine land."</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Zheng's eyes widened with surprise. "That's quite a strong ability to possess."</p>

  <p>"So now do you understand the whole concept?" Aleyna asked.</p>

  <p>"Therefore, in theory, she can kill anyone in the divine land, but there are some restrictions imposed on her. Whenever she displays the Time Backing, she has to pay a heavy price."</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings were quite strong now, and maybe the woman in white was no match for them.</p>

  <p>However, she had the ability to go back to any time in the past.</p>

  <p>The endless training and opportunities in many divine eras enabled the Holy Beings to acquire all they had today. If the woman in white went back to hundreds or even thousands of divine eras ago, the Holy Beings were only ordinary divine citizens, or even babies that had just been born in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Had she killed them then, it wouldn't have been possible for her to meet them now.</p>

  <p>Such was the ability of the white dressed woman.</p>

  <p>Besides the fact that going back in time was incredible, there might have been something else the woman in white could do, as indicated by the reaction of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>There must be a reason behind the Holy Beings' attitude towards the white dressed woman.</p>

  <p>"Is this the ability of the Timing Godly Way?" Zheng asked, still very much confused. It would be quite incredible if this ability was gained by cultivating the Timing Godly Way, as there was no room for anyone to resist it.</p>

  <p>No one was initially strong. No matter how powerful the Holy Beings were now, there was a time when they were quite weak. If the Timing Godly Way was indeed so powerful, then there wouldn't have been any need to cultivate other Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Aleyna said shaking her head. "It's true that the Timing Godly Way has the power of Time Backing, but it can only be used for oneself. One can only use it to go back to his or her past, but the woman can use it to go back to any time in the divine land."</p>

  <p>"And how does she do that?" Zheng continued to enquire.</p>

  <p>"The Time Sea is also a large forbidden land. She has controlled the Time Sea and obtained the Time Sword of Gods. Thus, her ability is derived from the sword," Aleyna explained.</p>

  <p>"The Time Sea is a forbidden land?" Zheng asked, clearly baffled.</p>

  <p>The majority of the True Gods in divine land were unaware of the fact that the Time Sea was a forbidden land. Many disciples of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands didn't know about it and a few who did acquired this knowledge from the Astronomical Transit Day.</p>

  <p>It was the first time for Aleyna to attend the Astronomical Transit Day.</p>

  <p>Since Liusu and she enjoyed a high status in their clan, it wasn't difficult for them to stumble upon such secrets. Moreover, it was the second time that Pascal had attended the Astronomical Transit Day, so he had told them something beforehand.</p>

  <p>"That's why things are as they are." Zheng gave her a nod.</p>

  <p>He had always been puzzled. According to the temperament of the Holy Beings of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands, they would have driven the Sun Blind members away from the Time Sea, or even killed them.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind members ferried others across the Time Sea. With such low efficiency, how could the powerful clans tolerate it?</p>

  <p>They didn't have any choice.</p>

  <p>In the early days when the powerful clans took control of the Time Sea, they did have conflict with the Sun Blind race.</p>

  <p>At first, there were six powerful clans on the Time Sea. Then, a new Holy Being also built his clan's Floating Island and joined the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>This new Holy Being was high spirited and arrogant. He couldn't tolerate the Sun Blind race, and even killed about fifty to sixty ferrymen. The six powerful clans didn't express their opinions about this matter. They thought the Sun Blind race was mysterious and weird, and they didn't want to provoke them in any way whatsoever.</p>

  <p>It wasn't in anyone's wildest thoughts that one day the new Holy Being would disappear along with his universe.</p>

  <p>Normally, it would take thousands of years for a huge universe to completely collapse, but the disappearance of the new Holy Being and his universe overnight was a complete and an utter mystery.</p>

  <p>Then, the Sun Blind race invited the Holy Beings of the six powerful clans to attend the Astronomical Transit Day for the first time. Thus, when they attended the Astronomical Transit Day, they came across the female patriarch of the Sun Blind race for the very first time. The patriarch wearing a mask told them that she had killed the new Holy Being.</p>

  <p>It was a well-known fact that the Holy Beings were immortal unless their universes were destroyed. After they built their universes, their lives were closely linked to their universes. Therefore, it was impossible for the patriarch of the Sun Blind race to kill a Holy Being quietly.</p>

  <p>Neither the patriarch nor anyone else was able to do it. Therefore, after killing Mike, Murphy started a war in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Even though at that time there was no Hall of Holy Beings, and there were no rules as far as a war was considered, the Holy Beings still couldn't destroy the huge universes in a short time even if they wanted to.</p>

  <p>But the female patriarch showcased her ability to destroy universes. On the Astronomical Transit Day, one of the Holy Beings carried a sword with him. The sword was not a top grade one, but he used it quite frequently in the past. It wasn't of much use to him now, yet he carried it with him wherever he went.</p>

  <p>Not long after the female patriarch left the grand meeting, the sword of the Holy Being suddenly disappeared. The Holy Being was quite shocked by seeing this.</p>

  <p>When the female patriarch appeared again, the Holy Being stared at her in confusion and murmured, "How did you…"</p>

  <p>A sword appeared in the hand of the female patriarch. It belonged to the Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Holy Beings were confused by her antics. They had no idea what was going on between that Holy Being and the patriarch. Later they learned that a memory had appeared in the Holy Being's mind. In that memory, the patriarch had traveled back to forty divine eras ago. At that time, that Holy Being was still a low-rank True God, but he was robbed of his sword by the patriarch. The patriarch told him that they'd meet forty divine eras later.</p>

  <p>Only then did the other Holy Beings understand how powerful the patriarch of the Sun Blind race was.</p>

  <p>The fact that the Holy Beings were invincible was a mere joke to her.</p>

  <p>The female patriarch's presence enabled the members of the Sun Blind race to safely sail their boats on the Time Sea. No clan dared to provoke them.</p>

  <p>"But you said that she couldn't kill everyone, right?" Zheng asked again with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard that she couldn't kill Nicholas, the Holy Emperor of the Dongfang Clan," Aleyna said. "I don't know what he did, but he seems to hide all his traces in the divine land, so the patriarch of the Sun Blind race can't track back to his past and can't kill him."</p>

  <p>She briefly heard these stories, and she wasn't aware of the full details.</p>

  <p>As Aleyna was speaking, the patriarch of the Sun Blind race walked barefooted towards the nine pagodas. She reached out her slender hands and gently waved them on both sides. The nine pagodas began to move slowly towards the middle, and they leaned against each other, forming a mysterious stellar pattern.</p>

  <p>There was a total of nine stars in the pattern. Each of them had a different color, and the star in the middle was light blue.</p>

  <p>"This time it's going to be the Water Luminous Star," the patriarch said softly.</p>

  <p>After she finished speaking, she reached out and gently patted the star.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed the light of the star become dimmer. He raised his head, and much to his astonishment, he saw a light blue star appear in the sky.</p>
