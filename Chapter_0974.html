<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng seemed to be heading outside the Ethereal City and Eddie was glad to see him do that. As he did so, he sent a message to Simon using the message rune, asking him to help seize Luo Luo Zheng with him together.</p>

  <p>But the truth was Luo Luo Zheng did not escape from the Ethereal City. Instead he was flying around the city. Naturally, Eddie was wary of him.</p>

  <p>"What are you worried about?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a smirk. He was a mere thousand feet from Eddie.</p>

  <p>Eddie's expression darkened. He looked around carefully, but did not discover anything suspicious. However, he couldn't quell the doubt in his heart, which grew even stronger when he saw Luo Zheng's smile.</p>

  <p>The two of them now stood still, staring at each other.</p>

  <p>"Since that's the case, I'll be leaving now!" Luo Luo Zheng turned to leave.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Luo Zheng was about to leave, Eddie was immediately angered. He suspected that this was a kind of double bluff.</p>

  <p>He had no choice but to activate his life vitality. He suddenly accelerated, and zoomed towards Luo Luo Zheng at a high speed.</p>

  <p>"Attack!"</p>

  <p>As he watched Eddie arrive in the air above the palace, Luo Luo Zheng let out a loud shout.</p>

  <p>Under Eddie, rays of light suddenly burst out from the palace. Little by little, the rays converged to form lines. All streets, within a 1, 500-feet radius released a red light. It looked as though the sun had descended on the ground. The streets connected and evolved into a gigantic rune.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Space Law Power suddenly reverberated within the palace. There were a few flashes of incandescent light, and Brent, Robin and the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit appeared.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The rays of light formed countless small dragons in the huge rune formed by the streets. They soared up to the sky and surrounded Eddie at lightning speed. Some dragons circled his limbs, while the others wrapped themselves around his body. In the blink of an eye, the small dragons had trapped him completely.</p>

  <p>"I've long heard about Arnold's peerless relic hidden within the Ethereal Spirit Sect other than the Illusory Array. Today, I finally saw it? the Dragon-trapping Rope. It really is extraordinary!" Luo Luo Zheng praised.</p>

  <p>He hadn't witnessed the power of the Illusory Array of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. However, the power of this Dragon-trapping Rope was something that he sincerely admired.</p>

  <p>The Central Region didn't belong to the Upper World. Unlike Luo Luo Zheng, who was able to obtain the inheritance of the divine texture, Arnold did not have any predecessors from whom he could learn. He could only rely on himself to understand and create the runes. Even so, he was able to display the full potential of the rune technique. Luo Luo Zheng could tell from the power of the Dragon-trapping Rope that it was not inferior to a three-star divine texture.</p>

  <p>Brent and Robin suddenly passed through the void and arrived in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit also slowly flew into the air; the seven of them were already on guard, holding their long swords and facing Eddie.</p>

  <p>In addition to Brent and the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit, there were two other disciples of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, who were escorting a green-clothed female servant.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning, on the other hand, had broken free of Luo Zheng's grasp and was retreating a few steps, glaring fiercely at him. Then, she flew towards the two disciples of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. "What are you doing? Why did you capture Linsey? Let her go!" she demanded.</p>

  <p>A bitter expression appeared on Brent's face as he said, "Mu Ning, she is Eddie's spy."</p>

  <p>"That's impossible! Linsey has been with me since childhood, and is extremely close to me. How can she be one of Eddie's people?"</p>

  <p>Xi Youqin's face was filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>Hearing her words, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh, a bitter smile playing on his lips. Xun, however, rolled her eyes and whispered to Luo Luo Zheng, "It's best to kill this idiot. Her living in this world is such a waste of food!"</p>

  <p>Linsey indeed grew up together with Mu Ning, and they were as close as sisters. She was also a nature creature. Getting her to betray Mu Ning was a piece of cake for Eddie. He didn't even need to do it himself.</p>

  <p>Darius had done everything for him.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning, stop messing around!" scolded Brent. Now even he could not hold it in any longer.</p>

  <p>"But Linsey is..." Mu Ning was still unconvinced.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>An invisible spear light shot out suddenly. Even the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit and Robin were wary of it. The spear light was zooming towards Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The spear light grazed Xi Youqin's cheek and cut off a strand of hair near her ear. It left a thin scar on her face and she started bleeding.</p>

  <p>"If you continue with your nonsense, I'll definitely kill you," Xun threatened. She looked and sounded serious about carrying out her threat.</p>

  <p>Xun seemed like a devil from hell to Mu Ning. She immediately clammed up.</p>

  <p>Robin's heart ached when he noticed the cut on his daughter's face, but he couldn't say anything.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! I thought the Ethereal Spirit Sect, the number one sect in the world, was rather weak because Xander had been hiding all this time. It turns out that all of you had planned for this a long time ago. Nice job!</p>

  <p>This is really interesting. Ha-ha!" Eddie, still trapped in the Dragon-trapping Rope, suddenly started laughing maniacally.</p>

  <p>Eddie had led over 10, 000 warriors of his divine kingdom to surround the Ethereal Spirit Sect, but Xander had been stubbornly staying within the sect. Xander had acted as if he was afraid of Eddie and didn't dare to fight against him.</p>

  <p>In reality, Eddie's movements and plans had long been monitored by the Ethereal Spirit Sect, and Xander had chosen to play it safe.</p>

  <p>Actually, Mu Ning was just bait to attract Eddie. Otherwise, Xander would definitely not have left her in the Xi Clan's castle. Instead, he would've let her hide inside the Ethereal Spirit Sect at least for a while.</p>

  <p>Xander had originally planned to assign Brent to help Mu Ning escape and lead Eddie to the Dragon-trapping Rope. However, Brent had just stepped into the Virtual Tribulation Realm. While he was proficient in the Space Law, he might not be able to smoothly complete the mission.</p>

  <p>Coincidentally, Luo Luo Zheng had appeared at the right time!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't know about the Ethereal Spirit Sect's plan when he first entered the Xi Clan's castle. Robin and the others had acted out a scene, and eventually forced Mu Ning to leave with Luo Luo Zheng. As her personal servant, Linsey naturally knew about this!</p>

  <p>While everyone was having lunch in the Xi Clan's castle, it appeared that they were laughing loudly on the outside, but they were actually secretly communicating with each other using their life vitality. Mu Ning and Linsey had not joined them for lunch, but there was a high chance that Linsey was not the only spy lurking in the Xi Clan, so everyone was very careful.</p>

  <p>By the time Linsey had secretly lit the message rune, Luo Luo Zheng had already agreed to their plan. He rushed into Xi Youqin's room and pretended to leave in a hurry. Meanwhile, Eddie had already received the news and rushed over from outside the Ethereal City.</p>

  <p>From start to finish, Mu Ning was the only person who didn't know about their plan.</p>

  <p>As foolish as she was, she now understood that right from the start, she was just a bait.</p>

  <p>She thought that she was valued and doted upon by everyone in the Xi Clan. Whether it was her great-grandpa, her father or the other elders of the Xi Clan, they all spoiled her and treated her well. She never thought that in the end, she was just a pawn in their games.</p>

  <p>"How could you treat me this way?" Xi Youqin's eyes were blurry with tears. She looked miserable, but nobody was paying attention to her as everyone's focus was Eddie.</p>

  <p>"Eddie, you're so arrogant even when you're about to die. The Ethereal Spirit Sect is known as the number one sect in the world. Do you really think that it earned this reputation just like that? Or that it's just hype?" roared the leader of the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit, pointing his long sword at Eddie.</p>

  <p>There was no fear in Eddie's eyes as he continued to sneer, "Indeed. You are a bit smarter than I thought, but unfortunately you are no match for me!"</p>

  <p>With that, a black mist erupted from between his brows. It instantly enveloped him, as well as the Dragon-trapping Rope. The mist seemed to be corroding the Dragon-trapping Rope.</p>

  <p>"Isn't the Dragon-trapping Rope able to ban someone from using the life vitality?</p>

  <p>How is Eddie still able to use it?"</p>

  <p>"That isn't life vitality. It must be some sort of secret technique that doesn't require the use of life vitality."</p>

  <p>"We can't let him destroy the Dragon-trapping Rope! Kill him! Now!"</p>

  <p>The Ethereal Spirit Sect had planned this for a long time. They were heavily relying on Arnold's Dragon-trapping Rope to kill Eddie.</p>

  <p>Although this move was risky, once he was killed, the Ethereal Spirit Sect would have unparalleled achievements. Without Eddie, the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom would collapse on its own.</p>

  <p>It was for this reason that Luo Luo Zheng had agreed to cooperate with the Ethereal Spirit Sect. After all, he shared the same goal with the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>The Dragon-trapping Rope was extremely powerful. It was said that even a warrior at the Life and Death Realm had no way of escaping after being trapped within it. But Eddie had managed to outwit it using a secret technique.</p>

  <p>This scene caused anxiety in everyone, including the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit. With their swords raised, six of them retreated while the rest one advanced. The array formed by the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit was also their strongest technique.</p>

  <p>The leader collected the life vitality and sword intent of the other six people, and suddenly, a sword light erupted. Although he was only a warrior at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, the power of his sword was now comparable to the full force of a warrior at the Life and Death Realm.</p>
