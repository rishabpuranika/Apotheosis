  <p>
</p>

  <p>Judging from the look on Gant's face, it was possible that this Snow Sword involved a sad story.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng ignored his reaction since this was obviously the matter of the Su Clan.</p>

  <p>Carefully, he stowed the long sword. For some reason, Gant immediately followed when he went out of the Best Swords Shop.</p>

  <p>"How much longer are you going to keep following me?" Zheng asked, getting a little annoyed.</p>

  <p>Gant seemed a bit troubled. But he answered almost immediately, "Okay, I have decided now!"</p>

  <p>"What have you decided about?" Zheng inquired as he became intrigued.</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you and join your crew!" Gant replied earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Huh? You want to join my crew?" Zheng was a little bit shocked with Gant's forwardness. "You are a Flag Master, right?"</p>

  <p>To this, Gant promptly responded, "Yes. Nonetheless, I don't have any problem with giving it up. The Flag Master I followed and supported before has been promoted to an Alliance Chief. Naturally, I took up his post as the Flag Master. He is about to participate in the competition for becoming a Oneness Guard. Therefore, I am now free to do anything I want!"</p>

  <p>In accordance with the rules of the Dragon City, a person was allowed to relinquish the position of a Flag Master. However, cases like these were pretty uncommon.</p>

  <p>In addition to that, the cultivation base of Gant was even higher than Zheng's!</p>

  <p>"But if you surrender your post as the Flag Master, you will not be able to enter the Dragon City anymore. Am I right?" Even though Zheng wanted his crew to grow even stronger, he was still having second thoughts about letting Gant join them.</p>

  <p>"It's alright. You don't have to worry about that. I have secret and special ways of getting in and out of the Dragon City," Gant replied with a sly smile.</p>

  <p>"One final question, why do you wish to follow me?" Zheng queried.</p>

  <p>Gant's face betrayed a subtle hint of shrewdness as he chuckled and told him, "Hey, I just wanted to follow and support a rich man."</p>

  <p>With that, Zheng accepted Gant's request to join him. After all, the Su Clan was known for their great skill in weapon refining for generations. Thus, Gant would be a good addition to their crew. In any case, Zheng felt as though he wanted to join their crew for a much deeper reason. There was a high possibility that it was because of the sword he had just purchased.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Gant gave up his flag the moment they stepped out of the Dragon City. He walked towards an old man and recorded his action.</p>

  <p>Later on, they headed down to the marketplace outside the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>The market here was a massive one. Since they had quite some time to spare, Zheng began wandering around and checking the different commodities available here.</p>

  <p>Although it didn't quite rival the Dragon City, there were lots of peculiar things being sold here. And strangely enough, they were very cheap. He even saw a vendor selling Latent Theurgies sealed with runes.</p>

  <p>After a while, they left the market. Zheng proceeded to search for his people.</p>

  <p>Beldene and the others were extremely delighted as they saw him. They immediately surrounded him. Meanwhile, he introduced Gant to them.</p>

  <p>The disciples were clearly astonished to find out that an Other Shore Realm warrior agreed to join them. Nevertheless, they reckoned it was a very good decision. Ultimately, they were aware that they needed to strengthen their crew.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Beldene gently flipped his hand and took out a small bottle. He cheerfully turned to Zheng and asked him, "Flag Master, look at what I've got!</p>

  <p>Do you have any idea what this is?"</p>

  <p>But before Zheng had the chance to examine it carefully, Gant just took one look at it and said, "That one is the Heavenly Pure Liquid. Even if it's known as the purest spirit liquid, it's not that rare. On the other hand, it can be used to lower the temperature during the process of weapon refining.</p>

  <p>And because it is incredibly pure, some people actually use it to produce wine..."</p>

  <p>"Hmm, it seems rather identical to the Sword-reading Liquid," replied Zheng as he scrutinized it. But as he noticed, the Heavenly Pure Liquid did not have a truth aura.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is because Sword-reading Liquid is created using the Heavenly Pure Liquid. And even though it is incredibly cheap, there are only a few people who are able to use it to make the Sword-reading Liquid," responded Gant with a shrug.</p>

  <p>Beldene ignored Gant's comment and appeared really excited about this.</p>

  <p>Again, he turned to Zheng and said, "Flag Master, the Heavenly Pure Liquid is indeed quite cheap. This bottle has only cost me ten divine crystals!"</p>

  <p>"So, what now? Are you intending to use it to make wine?" Gant asked as he casually stretched out his arms.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master, I just had an idea. I bet we can earn a healthy profit if we use this to make the Sword-reading Liquid," Beldene continued while glancing at Gant.</p>

  <p>"Ahem!"</p>

  <p>This statement left Gant speechless and completely dumbfounded. He must have misheard what Beldene just said.</p>

  <p>There were only a few people who could make the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>That was why it was unbelievably rare!</p>

  <p>Across the entire Oneness Sky Palace, only fourteen people were capable of making that. And in this case, all of those people possessed the ability of Instant Enlightenment!</p>

  <p>Among those fourteen people, some had already passed away while some were now holding high positions. Anyhow, most of them were plainly uninterested in selling the Sword-reading Liquid to earn money. There was only one or two of them who would be willing to make it.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why Gant was shocked to hear that Beldene wanted to make the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>Zheng's answer, however, astounded him even more.</p>

  <p>"Hmm, it is true that we can earn lots of divine crystals if we are able to sell the Sword-reading Liquid to people." Zheng uttered while taking the bottle from Beldene.</p>

  <p>At any rate, the Heavenly Pure Liquid was conveniently inexpensive. He could easily turn it into the Sword-reading Liquid by using the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. There were no other techniques that required using up his Truth of Eternal Sword Intent other than using the Soaring Snake Sword to activate the Imperial Sword Seal...</p>

  <p>Gant's jaw almost hit the ground as he stared thunderstruck at Zheng and asked, "Are you really capable of making the Sword-reading Liquid?"</p>

  <p>Zheng casually looked at Gant and then covered the opening of the bottle with his hand. The truth aura spiraled into the bottle. As it happened, the Heavenly Pure Liquid inside it started to swirl slowly.</p>

  <p>"The truth aura is mixing with the liquid..." Gant was thoroughly bewildered.</p>

  <p>He thought the Heavenly Pure Liquid was only useful because of its purity.</p>

  <p>It was a substance that had no reaction with almost any kind of energy.</p>

  <p>Because of that, it was absolutely difficult to change its properties.</p>

  <p>The only and perfectly compatible thing with it was the Truth of Godly Way!</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Pure Liquid would turn muddy if the Truth of Godly Way had any kind of imperfection.</p>

  <p>In this case, the creation of the pure Sword-reading Liquid would fail.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! Have you achieved the Instant Enlightenment?" With this bit of information, Gant became fully aware of what was happening.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Zheng had in fact achieved the Instant Enlightenment. Hence, he was extremely powerful. That explained why even with his current cultivation base, he was able to pass the test on the first floor of the Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>"Can you please examine this? Is this the Sword-reading Liquid?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Gant's face registered a look of surprise as he felt the truth aura in the bottle. After a while, he exclaimed, "I see! Now, I understand how you can be so rich without having an extraordinary background. But I'm quite baffled as to why someone of your ability and strength still stays in the Dragon City."</p>

  <p>"You know what, I also ask myself the same question," replied Zheng as he merely shrugged.</p>

  <p>From the Ear Mouse alone, Zheng acquired fifteen million divine crystals. But since then, he had purchased many things. Now, he had not many divine crystals left.</p>

  <p>If he didn't use the inheritance Chiyou left him, he would definitely be impoverished by now.</p>

  <p>Beldene's suggestion would greatly improve their situation. Furthermore, they could earn more divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Having decided on that, they instantly bought two hundred small bottles of Heavenly Pure Liquid from the market. They would be able to sell each bottle of pure Sword-reading Liquid for twenty thousand divine crystals.</p>

  <p>Even if they only sold it for ten or fifteen thousand divine crystals, they could still earn about two to three million divine crystals. The cost on their end was quite insignificant compared to their profit.</p>

  <p>By the end of the day, Zheng had already finished making the Sword-reading Liquid.</p>

  <p>Obviously, Zheng would not peddle these himself. He requested Beldene and the others to sell them in his stead. The liquid could probably reach more people beyond the Sword Wall when they traded it in the market.</p>

  <p>As he gazed at the bottles of Sword-reading Liquid, Gant also saw the growing mound of divine crystals. He couldn't stop himself from getting amazed. For generations, the Su Clan had poured their blood and sweat into refining divine weapons. They gave so much time and effort in refining a weapon, yet they were unable to earn as many divine crystals as Zheng had for just one night.</p>

  <p>Gant felt a bit frustrated. It was difficult for the Su Clan and many other powerful clans in the entire Bloom Divine Province to produce an extraordinary warrior who had the perfect compatibility with the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, Zheng started preparing for his voyage across the Sea of Truth again.</p>
