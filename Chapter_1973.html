<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1973 In A Dilemma (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>It didn't take long for Luo Zheng to gain quite a distance between him and the peddlers. After Ning Yudie caught up to him, she covered her mouth and giggled at his side.</p>

  <p>The passers-by on both sides of the street all cast strange gazes in their direction, not knowing what exactly the couple was doing.</p>

  <p>Only Geoffrey was extremely calm, still utterly focused on eating the snacks in his hands.</p>

  <p>From this experience though, Luo Zheng had definitely learned his lesson. The next time he'd take his son out to have a little fun, he'd at least come prepared with a few silver coins beforehand.</p>

  <p>Over the next few days, the three of them toured through several cities.</p>

  <p>Along the way, they'd even met a few warriors with low cultivation levels who cast greedy eyes on the beautiful Ning Yudie, seemingly having evil thoughts about her. Geoffrey stood in front of his mother just in time, and the warriors were all scared away by Zheng's Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Throughout the trip though, Luo Zheng had truly enjoyed a rare moment of joy.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that the universe's current situation was still very dangerous.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, he'd have been more than willing to take a decade or two of time to accompany Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>During the past few days, roars from the Roaring Tokens could often be heard booming throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>Since the Sacred race had invaded the Evolutionary Universe, they used the Roaring Tokens to announce their feats every time they occupied a supreme world or killed a world lord. In this way, they suppressed the morale of the people living in this universe.</p>

  <p>The said voices often rang in the people's ears, which was truly annoying, to say the least.</p>

  <p>However, the content spoken through the Roaring Token today was actually aimed directly at Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Upon hearing these words, Luo Zheng could do nothing but frown immediately.</p>

  <p>At that time, the clouds condensed with the rolling blood mist above the Ultimate Immortal City had completely disappeared, and the sky had once again returned to its deep blue color.</p>

  <p>The originally strong smell of blood had already faded quite a bit, and now, the stench seemed to give off a sweet and refreshing scent instead.</p>

  <p>After the Blood Curse Array had been destroyed by Luo Zheng, tens of millions of mortals were driven out of the Ultimate Immortal City. To the Sacred race, killing these mortals wouldn't bring them any honor. Without the Blood Curse Array playing its role, their reckless slaughter of mortals would only cause them to be tainted with malicious auras.</p>

  <p>They knew it would be better to leave these mortals run their own course.</p>

  <p>The said mortals understood that they had just narrowly escaped death and were beginning to migrate to their individual hometowns. As long as they weren't tortured by the Sacred martial artists, they were quite resilient and were determined to overcome many difficulties in order to return home.</p>

  <p>When they passed a hillside that was a hundred miles away from the Ultimate Immortal City, they discovered a huge crater that they had never seen before!</p>

  <p>It was so huge that if one stood at the edge of the crater, it was almost impossible to see the bottom.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng had snuck into the fairy palace, he used the Teleportation Token to remove the fairy palace's node and disappeared right before Maha's eyes, causing him to feel enraged.</p>

  <p>Maha simply couldn't wrap his mind around the idea that Luo Zheng had such a miraculous ability. He didn't believe that Luo Zheng could stealthily disappear directly in front of two Sacred Supreme Lords!</p>

  <p>This wasn't an ability that a world lord should possess! Even a Supreme Lord wouldn't have had the capacities to do that!</p>

  <p>That was why, after Zheng's disappearance, Maha firmly believed that Luo Zheng had used some form of concealment technique in order to hide himself underground.</p>

  <p>"We'll find him, even we have to dig three feet under!" at the time, Maha shouted his order with confidence.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had, however, dug much more than just three feet into the ground. It was even possible to say that they had dug more than three thousand feet. The final result was obvious � Luo Zheng had miraculously disappeared, just like that!</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had returned to the Evolutionary Universe, he had broken apart the Sacred race's Blood Curse Array. At the same time, he had humiliated Maha throughout the entire universe, which had destroyed the Sacred race's confidence,. After all that, he had escaped safely.</p>

  <p>To Maha though, this was an unacceptable defeat!</p>

  <p>Following such occurrence, Maha urgently gathered all of the Sacred Supreme Lords in the Evolutionary Universe and convened an emergency meeting.</p>

  <p>For their invasion of Evolutionary Universe, the Sacred race didn't send out all of their forces. They only sent forty four Supreme Lords, Maha and a multitude of Godly Geniuses from the Sacred race, as well as tens of thousands of world lords.</p>

  <p>From the overall situation, it was safe to assume that the Sacred race wasn't worried whatsoever.</p>

  <p>When it came to overall strength, they knew they had the upper hand.</p>

  <p>With their absolute advantage, occupying the entire Evolutionary Universe would be a breeze to achieve.</p>

  <p>In just three years, they had already taken up more than three thousand supreme worlds. Their current speed was already quite fast.</p>

  <p>According to the Sacred race's plan, even if they'd spent three hundred years occupying these three thousand supreme worlds, this still wouldn't be considered slow.</p>

  <p>Maha was the top Godly Genius, the leader of the Sacred race's expedition force. His strength might not be comparable to that of certain Supreme Lords, but he had the authority to command Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>That was why Supreme Lord Noel and Supreme Lord Barrie were like his subordinates before Maha.</p>

  <p>However, not all Supreme Lords were bossed around by him. "Maha!" someone shouted his name powerfully. "You actually let that human Godly Genius escape right in front of you! That's a grave dereliction of duty! And you know it!" The one speaking was Supreme Lord Denzel.</p>

  <p>He had the most seniority of all the Supreme Lords throughout the entire Sacred race, and he was a top-rank Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>When he heard that Maha had let the human Godly Genius escape, he simply questioned him right in the face, without showing any mercy.</p>
