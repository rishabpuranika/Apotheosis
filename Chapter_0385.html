<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 385 The Crude Imitation (Part Tow) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Essentially, since Luo Luo Zheng was only at the second grade of nature level, it seemed obvious to most people that he was an opportunistic rat, who would come up against a mighty master, like a disciple of the Illuminating Soul Realm, and then he would be at a loss and end up pulverized.</p>

  <p>'So, Cecil Zhuge is a member of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Maybe I will try out the Sword Step, ' mused Luo Luo Zheng instead of worrying like Mater Wen did. When he was at a half-step into the nature level, he managed to get the upper hand during a fight against a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Now, having broken through the confines that had held him back, Luo Luo Zheng was at the second grade of nature level, so, it shouldn't be as challenging to win against a disciple of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had completely mastered the extraordinary, quirky and ever fluctuating Sword Step, but, he wanted to test it in a real fray.</p>

  <p>The tall, handsome man with an effeminate air who stood arrogantly straight in the ring was Cecil Zhuge. In his hand was a fan bearing Eight Diagrams. It became apparent that the Eight Diagrams weren't patterns inscribed on it though, instead, they were slowly revolving against the fan, like they were alive.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng Luo, this isn't the first time I've heard your name," said Cecil Zhuge as he shook his head disdainfully and continued, "There are quite a few members in my family who hate your guts, it seems. If you weren't a disciple here at the Cloud Sect, you wouldn't be safe, and you would've died a hundred times over by now. It seems your luck has run out! You're my opponent, and I'm going to destroy you. Now, listen..."</p>

  <p>Interrupting the monolog, Luo Luo Zheng impatiently said, "I've got to hand it to the Zhuge family. Each of you, first Fren, then Yale, Josef, and now you, with such an ego! Each of you has piled the crap higher than the last!</p>

  <p>Let's get on with this brawl! Unless, you want to save yourself the hassle and forfeit now!"</p>

  <p>It shocked the disciples who were present when they heard Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Earlier, it was Tianming arrogant and boasting he'd fight Kim from the Illuminating Soul Realm without a sword, but, in light of how Luo Luo Zheng was behaving, Tianming's attitude was nothing.</p>

  <p>Tianming could back up his words with his skills. Without drawing his sword, he took on a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>But, what could Luo Luo Zheng do?</p>

  <p>True, it was a remarkable feat that someone at the second grade of nature level had a winning streak, like Luo Luo Zheng, relying purely on his agility and clout.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, most people thought it had been lucky that Luo Luo Zheng hadn't encountered a very strong opponent, up until now.</p>

  <p>In contrast to his previous opponents, Cecil Zhuge, was one of the top hundred ranked inner disciples and a true master of the Illuminating Soul Realm. The spectators couldn't help but think Luo Luo Zheng had a mental issue.</p>

  <p>Taunting his rival the way Luo Luo Zheng was doing only added fuel to the fire, and brought him closer to death!</p>

  <p>"I won't talk nonsense with you, since you'll just argue, unconvinced until you come face to face with the grim reality yourself! Instead, I'll show you the difference between masters of Illuminating Soul Realm and nature creatures!" said Cecil Zhuge, seething. He'd been tipped off by his family, to do his utmost to kill Luo Luo Zheng if he ran into him at the All Peaks Competition, and if he succeeded, his family would take responsibility!</p>

  <p>In fact, it wasn't just the Zhuge Clan who wanted Luo Zheng's life ended during the competition. There was a disciple who Saint Viana arranged to kill Luo Luo Zheng. Because of Mu Ning, Saint Viana was uneasy about murdering Luo Luo Zheng, and probably told the disciple to make it look like an accident.</p>

  <p>Still, the ongoing conflict between Luo Luo Zheng and the Zhuge Clan was publically known, so Cecil Zhuge had none of the apprehension of ending Luo Zheng's life!</p>

  <p>Accordingly, Cecil Zhuge was blatantly ruthless right from the start. He waved his fan, bringing an evil wind of life vitality rolling at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Adding to the intensity, rolling thunder heralded lightning that was building within the amazing force of evil wind closing in on Luo Luo Zheng...</p>

  <p>As the violent onslaught barreled down on Luo Luo Zheng, he made use of Tianming's Sword Step, and took a slow, calculated step.</p>

  <p>After he'd won against Kim, Tianming had gone back to join the other Skytop Peak disciples. He wasn't interested in watching the other battles, so, instead, he was lying down, and resting with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>When he heard Luo Zheng's outrageous remarks, his eyes shot open in surprise.</p>

  <p>A knowing grin spread as he slowly shook his head before once more closing his eyes. Boasts were countless in such a vast, strange world.</p>

  <p>Anyone could talk big and gloat, but, it was a rarity to find someone able to back up the outlandish declarations.</p>

  <p>Just as his eyes closed again, Tianming heard someone exclaim loudly,</p>

  <p>"What's going on? He knows the Sword Step method too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's definitely the Sword Step! Luo Luo Zheng mastered the method as well!"</p>

  <p>As the audience watched, Luo Luo Zheng slowly made his way around the ring, performing the same maneuvers to the Sword Step method as Tianming did earlier, and dodged Cecil Zhuge's evil wind.</p>

  <p>At first glimpse, some eagle-eyed disciples recognized the method and commented on Luo Zheng's performance. "That's the Sword Step. He's performing the technique exactly how Tianming did, but, Luo Zheng's Sword Step only appears identical. It doesn't contain the sword intent that Tianming used. How ridiculous, it's merely a crude imitation!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Tianming used Sword Step, whereas this guy copied the motions and how they appeared, and hasn't learned about the sword intent within it. What's the use of that?"</p>

  <p>The endless debating between disciples bombarded Tianming's ears.</p>

  <p>Intrigued along with being annoyed, he studied Luo Luo Zheng as he moved around the ring swiftly. Suddenly, one of Tianming's eyebrows arched strikingly, and what he beheld left him pretty shaken up!</p>

  <p>"That isn't true! Luo Luo Zheng isn't taking simple steps!"</p>
