  <p>
</p>

  <p>"That Other Shore Token... It appears to be a mysterious type, Spirits Trinity! "</p>

  <p>"Isn't Marco's Other Shore Token that blood hand?"</p>

  <p>"He accidentally obtained this Other Shore Token in the Seclusion Temple last year!"</p>

  <p>Among all the Other Shore Tokens, the mysterious type was the most special.</p>

  <p>Many Other Shore Tokens of the mysterious type possessed incredible abilities. If used properly, they'd be pretty much invincible!</p>

  <p>Zheng acted swiftly when seeing Marco's three-colored long sword. He waved his hand and grasped Snow Sword at once, ready for anything.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore contained thirty-three stages, and was divided into three different worlds. Both of them belonged to the first world, the Lust World.</p>

  <p>Marco had entered the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm, but Zheng had fused with an Other Shore Token from Stage Thirteen. Zheng's soul was not as strong as Marco's, but he still stood a chance here.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Zheng had his own trump card.</p>

  <p>As the fierce battle brewed, no one else present wanted to stop them.</p>

  <p>Those on Marco's side hoped that Marco would strike Zheng down with a single blow. None of the bystanders wanted to pass up this opportunity for a good show.</p>

  <p>Zheng had insisted to Dorothy and those from the Flow Sword Sect that this was his battle alone, so they would not get in the way.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>Marco gently lifted his three-colored long sword and three colored shadows formed a strange pattern. Just as he was about to launch an attack, a thread suddenly came from behind him.</p>

  <p>It lightly wrapped itself around the three-colored long sword, dimming the sword radiance in an instant. It had come from a young woman with a ponytail.</p>

  <p>She was accompanied by a few others as well.</p>

  <p>"The Seven Mountains Meeting is supposed to be a joyous occasion. It is not appropriate to fight here." The young woman waved her hand calmly, and dragged by the thread, Marco's long sword flew from his hand and into hers with ease.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng felt himself losing control of his own hand and soon Snow Sword flew from his hand to hers too.</p>

  <p>The young woman walked up to Marco, clasping the sword hilt and tip of the blade in her palms. She handed the long sword to Marco and warned him, "If you want to fight, you should wait until the end of the Seven Mountains Meeting."</p>

  <p>She then strolled to Zheng and passed Snow Sword to him, only glancing at him before leading the others up the high platform of the hall.</p>

  <p>Marco was still clearly enraged but subdued himself to a look of contempt at Zheng and nothing more. Zheng maintained a poker face as he returned to his seat.</p>

  <p>Konnor and the other elite disciples of the Flow Sword Sect let out a deep sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Who are these people?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the woman with a ponytail and her companions were much stronger than anyone else present. Even Marco dared not act rashly in front of them.</p>

  <p>"She is from the Land of Sword Grief, and her name is Tacy," Dorothy replied.</p>

  <p>"Land of Sword Grief?" Zheng blinked with surprise, feeling that the aura emitted by this woman was similar to that of the female demons in Divine Lair. "Is it similar to the Divine Lair of the Sun Crow race?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Dorothy nodded. "If we break through the Lust World and get to the Desire World, we would also qualify to join the Land of Sword Grief."</p>

  <p>In addition to the Divine Lair, the Sky Guard Pavilion of the Bearing race was also like the Land of Sword Grief. The structure of various big races seemed to be alike.</p>

  <p>The woman named Tacy was now on the stage and said, "I assume you have heard of the rewards of the Seven Mountains Meeting."</p>

  <p>The direct descendants of each mountain didn't respond. They didn't care much for the rewards. They attended the Seven Mountains Meeting to win honor for their mountains.</p>

  <p>However, the disciples of the swords sects responded with excitement bubbling within them.</p>

  <p>Tacy nodded and said, "As usual, we will begin after a meal."</p>

  <p>After a few more words, Tacy got off the high platform. Those from the Land of Sword Grief all sat down by the table. All kinds of delicious food and fine wine imaginable were then served. The maids fluttered through the hall like butterflies dressed in flowers. People were busy getting acquainted and chatting away with each other in a scene of gaiety.</p>

  <p>Still, the atmosphere grew increasingly tense as the meal went on.</p>

  <p>"This time, I hope you Azure Mountain will behave well. Ha-ha-ha..."</p>

  <p>"Humph! The Killing Sword Sect will be the champion!"</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>In the heated atmosphere, Marco still wore a stone cold face.</p>

  <p>The elites of the Vast Heaven Sword Sect from Vastness Mountain one by one proposed toasts to Marco.</p>

  <p>"Marco, be rest assured. Milo of the Flow Sword Sect hasn't come. There will be plenty of chances this time!"</p>

  <p>"I will avenge you!"</p>

  <p>"Avenge? Could that be called revenge? You are as insignificant as ants...</p>

  <p>You underestimate Marco."</p>

  <p>If Zheng belonged to the Origin Mountain, those from the Bright Mountain and the Vastness Mountain would have some scruples, as all the sword sects on mountains had their mountains' direct descendants here.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge belonged to the Oneness Mountain, but the Oneness Mountain owned three large sword sects, so she wouldn't be partial to anyone.</p>

  <p>"I don't need your help," said Marco, raising the glass of wine and gulping it down swiftly. "I will do it myself!"</p>

  <p>"That's great! I've been looking forward to witnessing your strength! "</p>

  <p>"……"</p>

  <p>The elite disciples of the Vast Heaven Sword Sect raced to flatter Marco as much as they could.</p>

  <p>Once the meal was over, they all left the tables.</p>

  <p>Tacy and others from the Land of Sword Grief led the crowd through the great hall and into the spiral aisle behind it.</p>

  <p>The corridor extended downward, far beyond what Zheng thought was possible. There seemed to be quite a huge construction built in the mountain.</p>

  <p>"Konnor, you said that the Seven Mountains Meeting is not a battle ring, but a game carefully designed. Did they build all this for this game?" Zheng asked, astounded by the work that had been put in.</p>

  <p>Before Konnor could reply, Dorothy answered, "Of course not. This mountain was once a training place of the Oneness Sky Palace. They re-purposed it once it was abandoned."</p>

  <p>The senior leaders of the Oneness Sky Palace had taken advantage of the situation, rearranging the magic array, setting up the rules and taking measures to improve it.</p>

  <p>After a five-minute walk down, Zheng left the corridor and stepped into a massive cave over ten thousand feet high. In the middle, there stood a mountain around five to six thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>It didn't look as though this mountain had been formed naturally because its surface shone with a metallic luster. No one knew what it had been used for.</p>

  <p>"Everyone to the position of your sword sect," Tacy ordered.</p>

  <p>As a descendant of the direct line of Origin Mountain, Dorothy could not stay with Zheng. She said goodbye and went to the right with Jermain and the others.</p>

  <p>There were a dozen huge stones of similar size at the bottom of the cave.</p>

  <p>Zheng, led by Konnor, climbed up one on the right as the elite disciples of other mountains climbed up their own huge stones.</p>
