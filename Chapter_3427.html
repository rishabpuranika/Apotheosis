<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3427 Formidable Opponent </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Fuxi, standing atop a snow mountain, only snorted when he heard Mount's words.</p>

  <p>He had no plans to take action.</p>

  <p>He didn't even make a move when Zheng, who Fuxi held in great importance, had been sealed by Mount. It would have been too late, anyway.</p>

  <p>But if Mount were to attack Yan, Fuxi would surely charge into the Chaotic Source World to rescue her without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Even Mount, who had spent all this time in the Chaotic Source World, could tell as much.</p>

  <p>"Oh, cut the crap!"</p>

  <p>As a successor of Eastern Emperor Taiyi and one of the best warriors of the Phoenix Palace, Feng Ge remained unfazed.</p>

  <p>A dangerous golden light flashed in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Divine flames of the Sun Crow race burst out from her hair, while the Warrior of the Stone Hill emerged above her. Tens of thousands of rays of sword radiance shot toward Mount, leaving no place for him to dodge.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Yan stretched out her hands and a crimson energy began to spread around her. The shadow of Snake Goddess appeared behind her, growing quickly in size.</p>

  <p>Chaim, Milo, Dorothy and Sally all launched their attacks at the same moment!</p>

  <p>"Stay back, Mya!" Mount shouted.</p>

  <p>Mya, however, was finding it fun tagging along with her Uncle Mount.</p>

  <p>She didn't want to miss out on anything at all.</p>

  <p>She could tell he was being serious, however. It was obvious he was unsure whether he could defeat these enemies from the Oneness Sky Palace and the Pear Hill. He had asked her to leave to spare her from danger before he went all out in this fight.</p>

  <p>"I won't..."</p>

  <p>Before Mya could finish protesting, she suddenly felt dizzy. Before she knew it, she was already on a mountain top.</p>

  <p>She looked around and soon realized that she was on the northern peak of the core area.</p>

  <p>She hadn't even sensed the aura of the space theurgy her uncle used to send her away!</p>

  <p>She stomped angrily before flying toward the main peak.</p>

  <p>Once Mya was safely out of the way, Mount wasted no time. He pushed his hands forward and with one hop, disappeared from everyone's sight.</p>

  <p>The next moment, he was behind Yan. He made a quick motion with his hands.</p>

  <p>A huge cube, measuring thirty feet on each side, quickly materialized out of thin air. Mount had apparently estimated Yan's shadow of Snake Goddess accurately, because the cube perfectly matched its current size.</p>

  <p>The cube was an isolated space cage. And right now, it had Yan and her shadow of Snake Goddess trapped.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>Yan shouted, her eyes twinkling with a strange color.</p>

  <p>Ordinary enchanted barriers and space cages couldn't restrict her freedom.</p>

  <p>But the cube remained motionless and was completely unaffected by the power she released.</p>

  <p>Yan refused to give up.</p>

  <p>Under her command, the shadow of Snake Goddess, which had now stopped growing, smashed at the cube again and again. These efforts were futile, however. None of the attacks managed to damage the space cage.</p>

  <p>After trapping Yan successfully, Mount turned to his other enemies with a smug smile. "You insisted on fighting me, so I decided not to disappoint you."</p>

  <p>His clothes suddenly began to quiver. Then they ripped apart, revealing his bronzed torso.</p>

  <p>"Six Origin Phantoms!"</p>

  <p>With a loud shout, two figures suddenly charged toward Mount. This turned out to be Dorothy and her clone.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had analyzed the situation more rationally than Feng Ge had.</p>

  <p>She knew there was no deep feud between Zheng and Mount. Mount might return Zheng to them if they could just negotiate.</p>

  <p>Of course, Mount already said he wouldn't do that.</p>

  <p>But Dorothy didn't fully believe him. She decided to get him under control first.</p>

  <p>As Dorothy and her clone brushed past each other on the path, they both split up further, creating two more clones. Then this new duo created another pair of clones.</p>

  <p>Now six figures, including Dorothy herself, circled Mount at an incredible speed, forming a mysterious pattern in their path.</p>

  <p>With Dorothy's current strength, it was rather difficult for her to use this skill.</p>

  <p>It would cause her harm to forcibly perform this skill. If her grandmother were there, she would have stopped her from doing this.</p>

  <p>Mount stood motionless as he was surrounded by the phantoms. Then he suddenly stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>With a snap, he deftly caught one of the clones.</p>

  <p>The others quickly moved into action, raising their swords and slashing at Mount.</p>

  <p>But none hit the target.</p>

  <p>In a flash, Mount was outside the circle. He pinched the neck of the clone he caught, easily breaking it.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The clone dissipated like melting ice and quickly turned into a flower. It was Dorothy's Other Shore Token, the Twin Blossoms.</p>

  <p>The other five phantoms promptly merged together until only the real Dorothy was left.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's face turned pale. The destruction of the clone caused considerable damage to her as well.</p>

  <p>If Mount had caught her real body, she would have been killed!</p>

  <p>As she stood there paralyzed by fear, Mount threatened her in a steady voice, "I will crush your real neck next time!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Now it was Chaim and Milo attacking Mount, coming in from his left and right, respectively.</p>

  <p>Milo owed Zheng a great favor, dating back from their days in the Flow Sword Sect. He could not just stand by and watch when Zheng needed help.</p>

  <p>Chaim raised his sword and drew a strange trail in the air, then bore down on Mount's face.</p>

  <p>His posture was quite strange. It was almost impossible for him to hit Mount with the move he was making. However, halfway through the slash, he suddenly turned around and jutted his sword backward.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Milo, who was beside him, suddenly leapt up in the air and slashed his sword down!</p>

  <p>"Heart Stab!"</p>

  <p>Both of their attacks seemed off. It looked less like they were fighting an enemy and more like they were casually training.</p>

  <p>But Mount reacted in perfect coordination with their movements. He changed his position and reappeared beneath Milo's sword.</p>

  <p>Milo's sword attack was a unique skill of the Flow Strike. Although it was not very powerful, it could cause the opponent to feel like he was in real trouble.</p>

  <p>Mount's moving theurgy was great, but his soul was at the same level as those at the thirteenth stage of the Other Shore Realm. In the face of the Heart Stab, he was alarmed and was forced to use spatial transference once again.</p>

  <p>This time, he appeared behind Chaim, who abruptly stabbed his sword backward and hit Mount precisely!</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, the stab was so weak it could not even pierce Mount's skin.</p>

  <p>But after landing the hit, Chaim retreated quickly but calmly, distancing himself from Mount. Milo followed suit and fell back.</p>

  <p>It was known that all space theurgies were rendered useless in the Chaotic Source World, but Mount was able to violate this rule.</p>

  <p>Knowing this, Chaim and Milo estimated that even if all of them took Mount on at the same time, there was a chance they still wouldn't be able to defeat him.</p>

  <p>This was why they had not been in a hurry to attack.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, while Dorothy and Feng Ge had been fighting Mount, Chaim and Milo were trying to come up with a solution.</p>
