<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1492 Burn The Star </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A look of confusion appeared on the faces of all the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Even Yao, Supreme Lord Addison, and Supreme Lord Gunter stopped fighting.</p>

  <p>Nothing could escape from these mighty warriors, and that was precisely why they had started fighting. They had been confident that the mini fairy palace wouldn't be able to go anywhere.</p>

  <p>But now, it had inexplicably disappeared.</p>

  <p>Escaping under the watchful eyes of so many Supreme Lords was impossible.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords quickly began to analyze the situation, and they all soon came to the same conclusion— the fairy palace hadn't left the Yellow Sand Star and was merely hiding within it.</p>

  <p>Faced with this tricky situation, the Supreme Lords that gathered on the Yellow Sand Star naturally stopped quarreling.</p>

  <p>They had all come for the Crown of Destiny, and that was their only goal. They had no interest in sparring with other Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Yao's cold gaze swept across the surface of the Yellow Sand Star over and over again, but she did not find any clues. In the end, her hostile eyes fell upon the other Supreme Lords. She cursed inwardly, 'If it weren't for these bastards, the fairy palace wouldn't be able to hide from me.'</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A few more figures descended from the sky. Several other Supreme Lords had rushed over.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Myles!" someone exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Myles was a mid-rank Supreme Lord. Even Yao frowned at the sight of him.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Amritpal!"</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Amritpal descended, his gaze first landed on Supreme Lord Myles.</p>

  <p>The two of them were a famous pair of rivals, bringing joy and entertainment to all creatures in the universe. They had been challenging and quarreling with each other for countless years, but they hadn't fought against each other even once. Many Supreme Lords had asked them why they hadn't engaged in a real fight, but the two of them always ignored those questions.</p>

  <p>Now that the Supreme Lords gathered on the Yellow Sand Star saw these two appear together, they thought that the two would immediately start bickering again. They never imagined that these two Supreme Lords would greet each other so warmly. It was as if they were good friends who hadn't seen each other in a long time.</p>

  <p>When two Supreme Lords fought against each other, the Crown of Destiny would dissipate after one of them died, and then it would randomly appear in a corner of the universe. So after a Supreme Lord killed another, the greatest benefit would fall into the hands of others. As a result, Supreme Lords would not fight to the death against each other unless they were sworn enemies. Previously, when Yao had fought with four Supreme Lords, none of them had used all their might.</p>

  <p>Not long after, more Supreme Lords arrived.</p>

  <p>The number of Supreme Lords circling Yellow Sand Star had reached twenty.</p>

  <p>It was extremely rare for so many Supreme Lords to be gathered in the same place.</p>

  <p>Even back in the days when the Heavenly Fruit Assembly was held, there were only 18 Supreme Lords. But now, on the Yellow Sand Star, there were twenty.</p>

  <p>And these Supreme Lords had all been attracted here by Luo Zheng, a mere Soul Sea Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>"What? That magic space treasure that looks like a fairy palace is hiding within the Yellow Sand Star right under your very eyes?" Supreme Lord Myles asked in disbelief as he shook his head. Then, he added, "Let me deal with it."</p>

  <p>He slightly raised his head and clasped his hands together. Two golden beams of light shot out from his eyes. The golden beams of light spread out and swept across the surface of Yellow Sand Star.</p>

  <p>"It is said that Supreme Lord Myles' Rebirth Pupils are able to see through the myriad of illusions under the heavens. I presume that he will be able to find that fairy palace," a Supreme Lord said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Myles' expression was indifferent. If it was true that the fairy palace was using a mere illusion technique, then his Rebirth Pupils would naturally be able to unravel the illusion.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Sand Star was not particularly large. In just a few seconds, the two rays of golden light had completely scanned the star. Following that, a puzzled expression appeared on Supreme Lord Myles' face.</p>

  <p>"This is really strange. I can't see the fairy palace even though it is clearly on the Yellow Sand Star. This is impossible!"</p>

  <p>His Rebirth Pupils were the eye technique he had cultivated from the Heavenly Destiny that he carried. It contained the Law of Causality to see through everything, and this Law of Causality wasn't something he had cultivated himself, but something he had inherited from the Heavenly Destiny. There was nothing within the heavens that he couldn't see through.</p>

  <p>If the fairy palace was hiding in plain sight using an illusion technique, how could he not see through it?</p>

  <p>This was a violation of the rules of the heavens. unless the fairy palace was something that surpassed the heavens.</p>

  <p>"Even the Rebirth Pupils couldn't see it?" a Supreme Lord pondered aloud.</p>

  <p>As Supreme Lords, they were all well aware of the Heavenly Destiny they carried. Each Heavenly Destiny had inherited an extremely powerful Law of Causality, and these Laws of Causality were the supreme laws of this universe. From the smallest grain of sand in this universe to the stars in the sky and the 100, 000 supreme worlds, everything had to follow these Laws of Causality without an exception.</p>

  <p>Hot water would boil when heated. Warriors would encounter Heavenly Tribulations when they were too strong. These were all Laws of Causality.</p>

  <p>These could also be considered the laws of the universe. The laws set down by the heavens could not be violated.</p>

  <p>Yao's expression became increasingly sullen. In order to humiliate Xun, she had acted on her own volition and sent out Viveca, Elspeth, Salvador, and Aneisha to deal with her. However, she had wasted a considerable amount of time by doing that. Now, the number of Supreme Lords that gathered in front of her was rapidly increasing.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the tiny fairy palace was gone.</p>

  <p>It would be great if she could find it before anyone else. Her biggest goal was to kill Xun, but the Crown of Destiny was still an object that she had to obtain. With so many Supreme Lords in front of her, it would not be an easy task for her and Supreme Lord Gunter to forcibly take the Crown of Destiny away.</p>

  <p>"Let me do it. Who cares what illusion technique he is using? This move is the simplest and most effective one!" said Supreme Lord Amritpal.</p>

  <p>The flame in his hand turned into the shape of a fire dragon and continuously floated around in his hand. "Since I can't see where the fairy palace is, I'll burn the entire star to ashes."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, that wisp of flame pounced forward.</p>

  <p>The tiny fire dragon flew out from his palm and quickly grew in size, transforming into a huge fire dragon that soared into the sky and headed straight for the Yellow Sand Star.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the fire dragon continued to grow in size, it circled around the star, wrapping it up in flames.</p>

  <p>All of the Supreme Lords retreated temporarily.</p>

  <p>None of them could deny that Supreme Lord Amritpal's method was an effective one.</p>

  <p>Destroying a star was not a difficult task for a Supreme Lord. If several Supreme Lords attacked together, even a supreme world would be torn to pieces, let alone a star like the Yellow Sand Star. The Orange Sea World of the human alliance was an example.</p>

  <p>Although the Yellow Sand Star was considered a relatively small star, its diameter was over 80, 000 miles. It was an absolute colossus.</p>

  <p>However, after the fire dragon wrapped it up, the surface of the Yellow Sand Star turned black, and then it began to slowly melt.</p>

  <p>"He wants to burn the entire star down," Luo Zheng murmured. His eyebrows twitched. "Supreme Lord Amritpal is such a decisive man!"</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Amritpal began to burn the Yellow Sand Star, Luo Zheng sensed a faint trace of sorrow in his perception. When that feeling of sorrow was transmitted to him, he instantly understood that it came from the will of the stars.</p>

  <p>Stars had their own will. Luo Zheng had understood that long ago when he had practiced the Stellar Body. So far, he had already activated more than 20 stars. The sadness of the stars that he felt was emitted from the stars that he himself had activated.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that he couldn't do anything to prevent this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head slightly. He could only watch as Supreme Lord Amritpal continued burning down the Yellow Sand Star.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Under the embrace of the fire dragon, a huge crack appeared in the middle of the Yellow Sand Star. It was actually starting to fall apart.</p>

  <p>However, the flames of Supreme Lord Amritpal did not die down.</p>

  <p>Instead, they continued burning the Yellow Sand Star with fierce intensity.</p>

  <p>Under the constant burning, the Yellow Sand Star's size continued to shrink. The easily incinerated materials within the star were burnt away.</p>

  <p>Within five minutes, the diameter of the Yellow Sand Star shrank from 80, 000 miles to 40, 000 miles.</p>

  <p>An hour later, the Yellow Sand Star shrank down to just 10, 000 miles in diameter.</p>

  <p>Just like that, a huge star had been slowly burned down. However, the fairy palace was still quietly lying inside.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Let's see how long the fairy palace can hold against such heat.</p>

  <p>Let's see how long it can hide. Brat, you scolded me back then. I can reject that Crown of Destiny, but I will definitely take your Roaring Token!" Supreme Lord Amritpal was someone who held grudges. He still remembered the time when Luo Zheng had insulted him when he was feeling down.</p>
