  <p>
</p>

  <p>Quentin referred to Luo Zheng's "Primal Chaos Technique", when he spoke about the method Luo Luo Zheng had used. But the truth was, Quentin couldn't cultivate this technique and there was no way Luo Luo Zheng would hand it over just like that.</p>

  <p>So, instead of wasting his time dealing with Quentin, Luo Luo Zheng just chose not to respond to his words.</p>

  <p>Now, he had no intention of leaving the platform at all.</p>

  <p>Quentin had made a temporary rule so that Luo Luo Zheng could speak up.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't expect the cocky attitude from Luo Luo Zheng and he was taken aback by the latter's insolent response to his request.</p>

  <p>Even the lady and the warriors in Quentin's entourage were dumbfounded at Luo Zheng's lack of respect towards Quentin. They couldn't comprehend what he meant and to top it all, they were stunned at his guts to stay on the platform.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Quentin asked again, giving Luo Luo Zheng a chance to take back what he said.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng had enough of this man's self-entitlement. His Mu Ning had noticeably increased, and his facial expression changed drastically as well. He chuckled, "I'm surprised that you can't understand. All I am saying is? I will be staying on this platform and you need to get your asses out of here right now. If you insist on staying, I have no choice but to cut your feet off!"</p>

  <p>Even an idiot could easily understand the situation.</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence on the platform...</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, those words that Luo Luo Zheng had spoken gave his three companions quite a scare. Lone's and Kurt's eyes widened in shock; while Lucille was hyperventilating. Her cheeks began to blush and her whole body was shaking.</p>

  <p>Out of these three warriors, Lucille was the most aggressive and ready to act when needed. However, she knew they had no chance of winning against these people from the divine land. There was nothing she could do earlier but suppress her anger.</p>

  <p>But after she heard Luo Zheng's words, she felt alive again. The valiant look on Luo Zheng's face melted her heart. Luo Luo Zheng had not changed even after coming out of the universe.</p>

  <p>His spirit and confidence were also contagious. She could feel it radiating from his Mu Ning. Could it be that Luo Luo Zheng had obtained another trump card?</p>

  <p>Back in the Illusion Battlefield, Lucille and the others had seen all of Luo Zheng's trump cards.</p>

  <p>However, this was not the universe, but the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. The only warriors who could take the test were the elites of the various universes and powerhouses from the divine land.</p>

  <p>Was Luo Luo Zheng confident to confront Quentin?</p>

  <p>But wait?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng just said that he wanted to occupy this platform.</p>

  <p>Aside from Quentin, there were other experts on this platform from other universes and the divine land.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng wanted this platform all to himself, it could only mean that he was confident in dealing with everyone on this platform!</p>

  <p>But Lucille wasn't certain if her deductions were right.</p>

  <p>It would all depend on how formidable Luo Zheng's trump card was. But deep down, she was hoping that her deductions were correct...</p>

  <p>Quentin was stunned and could not react for a while. But when he came back to his senses, his handsome face gradually twisted.</p>

  <p>His eyes widened and he smirked. "Ha-ha-ha!'</p>

  <p>And suddenly, he burst into laughter like a maniac in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His laugh echoed throughout the platform and the dozens of warriors from the divine land followed suit.</p>

  <p>The laughter on the platform was deafening.</p>

  <p>When the warriors from the other platforms heard the commotion, they looked over and saw Quentin and the other warriors laughing hysterically. They saw Luo Luo Zheng being power tripped by the other warriors and they couldn't help but pity him. However, they also knew that this was going to be a good show ? a nobody versus the elite warriors. Of course, there was no doubt that the latter would win.</p>

  <p>The warriors from other platforms didn't know who Luo Luo Zheng was and where he came from. To them, Luo Luo Zheng was only a secondary creature who was not even qualified to challenge this group of elites from the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Where did that guy come from? Who does he think he is?"</p>

  <p>"Heh, he seems to be friends with Lone!"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't know his place in this world."</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's time that the elites bring him back to his rightful place. This idiot is out of his mind!"</p>

  <p>Some warriors on the other platforms felt disgusted by Luo Zheng's confidence in challenging the elites, while others pitied him and could imagine what would happen next ? him being defeated and shamed for the rest of his life.</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Han Liusu was lying on her side against the air as if she was leaning on something. She was twirling a black crystal and casually stuffed it into her mouth.</p>

  <p>Although she still felt lightheaded from being flipped by Luo Luo Zheng, she still looked at him with fascination.</p>

  <p>She saw Luo Luo Zheng as a rather reserved person who didn't even understand the gravity of the situation. But no matter his apparent naivety, she had never thought that Luo Luo Zheng would have such a domineering side. It was quite appealing to her. This was an arena of rivalry between Luo Luo Zheng and Quentin!</p>

  <p>Han Liusu had wanted to teach Quentin a lesson, as this bastard had deceived her younger sister with sweet words a long time ago. However, she never thought that things went better than she expected. Han Liusu was overjoyed with the situation now.</p>

  <p>Smiles and laughter echoed throughout the platform - nature had a way of keeping the balance in this world. "Just smile! The happier you laugh, the more miserable you'll be, ' thought Han Liusu with satisfaction. She did not bother to look at Quentin Qin, but when she heard his laughter, she felt at ease.</p>

  <p>The sound of laughter on the platform gradually subsided.</p>

  <p>The manic smile on Quentin's face completely disappeared. In an instant, his eyes were filled with hatred and his body radiated with a murderous Mu Ning. He said, "It's been a long time since I met such a daring secondary creature! It's a pity that I have to kill you!" He laughed again, then abruptly stopped. Silence filled the platform and not even the wind made a sound. Then Quentin shouted, "Isaiah!"</p>

  <p>Soon after, a member of the Skyland race flew to the platform.</p>

  <p>This Skyland race man named Isaiah was the gatekeeper of Tidal Surge, and his duty was to maintain peace and order in this place.</p>

  <p>In this place, a warrior's goal was to refine more Pristine Life Vitality from Tidal Surge and to do that, one had to have the platform all to himself. This was the main cause of many disputes in this platform. So, the Skyland race had no choice but to send a man to guard this area.</p>

  <p>Aside from the man sent by the Skyland race, a strict rule was also implemented in this area - immediate expulsion for any warrior who would dare to create chaos in this area.</p>

  <p>As a result, no warrior dared to disrupt peace and order of this place.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors from the divine land were treated differently.</p>

  <p>From the moment they entered this land, they were being looked after and cared for. A divine land warrior like Quentin Qin would never be expelled, even if he acted against the rules. As long as he did not end one's life, the Skyland race would turn a blind eye to whatever he would do.</p>

  <p>No warrior would dare to question or harm any warrior from the divine land in fear of being expelled even if it was self-defense. It was like these divine land warriors were untouchable in this area.</p>

  <p>Therefore, despite the disgust and anger of many warriors from other races towards Quentin's group, nobody dared to speak up or resist. It was a lose-lose situation: If they resisted and won, they would be expelled; but if they resisted and lost, they would still be expelled and be shamed for the rest of their lives.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Qin, what's the matter?" Isaiah, the Skyland race warrior, asked while his wings kept flapping as he floated in the air.</p>

  <p>"Today, blood will run in this platform! Someone would wish he wasn't born!" Quentin said loudly as if sentencing Luo Luo Zheng to die.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Qin? I hope you can reconsider. This doesn't look good." Isaiah's face was clouded with hesitation.</p>

  <p>The Skyland race was one of the six races guarding the sacred places for cultivation. Normally Skyland race treated all warriors considerably fair, except they would tolerate some doings of warriors from divine land.</p>

  <p>Nothing outrageous happened here until now.</p>

  <p>This group of warriors from the divine land often competed with each other but mostly to fool around or teach others a lesson. They had never killed anyone here before.</p>

  <p>"I don't care! Go and report this to your leader. I'm sure my clan can afford the price!" Quentin said coldly without even looking at Isaiah.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Qin!" Isaiah wasn't an important figure within the Skyland race. And since Quentin had asked for permission, it was good enough. It was useless to report this to his leader. Anyway, he couldn't care less if these foreign warriors died.</p>

  <p>Including Collapsing Mountain race, the six races had hidden grudges for these warriors from other races. To them, the foreign warriors were parasites in their cultivation sacred places. The warriors from the six races considered these places as rightfully theirs, and the foreign warriors were slowly taking something away from them.</p>

  <p>Looking at Luo Luo Zheng, Quentin looked devilish and ferocious. "I will let you live if you hand over that method to refine Pristine Life Vitality and destroy your cinnabar field and Path Platforms by your own!"</p>

  <p>Quentin already knew that Luo Luo Zheng was a cultivator who cultivated both body and life vitality. The most essential thing for a body refiner of his current stage was the Path Platforms, while the most essential thing for a cultivator who cultivated life vitality was the cinnabar field. It would be a disaster for a cultivator who cultivated both body and life vitality, if both were destroyed.</p>

  <p>"Just hand it over and you'll live to see another day. Otherwise, you'll die!"</p>

  <p>"Once Master Qin acts, there's no way he'll stop!"</p>

  <p>"Your method isn't that great. Just hand it over! It's better in the hands of Master Qin!"</p>

  <p>The warriors behind Quentin clamored.</p>

  <p>But none of them truly understood how bizarre Luo Zheng's method of refining the Pristine Life Vitality was. Since Luo Luo Zheng was considered as a secondary creature, his methods were also seen the same way. They thought Luo Luo Zheng only had advantages on Pristine Life Vitality refining, although his methods might be clever.</p>

  <p>They didn't know that Luo Luo Zheng had never used any method to refine the Pristine Life Vitality. He had refined so much Pristine Life Vitality just by using the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>At this moment, everyone hoped that Quentin could obtain this method from Luo Luo Zheng. If Quentin would like to share that method with them, each of them could occupy a platform. Eventually, they could monopolize and obtain all the resources from all platforms above the Tidal Surge.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu took another black crystal and stuffed it in her mouth as she watched the scene unveiled. She glanced at the group of idiots and shook her head in disappointment.</p>
