  <p>Life vitality crystals, from what Luo Luo Zheng had learned from Xun, were also in circulation and used as one of the main currencies in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Since these mighty Soul Sea Realm warriors were very much willing to give him tons of supreme life vitality crystals in exchange for the ores, then of course Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't refuse them.</p>

  <p>Just as he finished speaking, a Soul Sea Realm warrior approached Luo Luo Zheng,</p>

  <p>"I practice the Water Law and I just happen to need this Water Crystal.</p>

  <p>I'll give you thirty thousand supreme life vitality crystals for it, how about that?"</p>

  <p>Thirty thousand supreme life vitality crystals were not a paltry sum so Luo Luo Zheng naturally accepted. The first deal was quickly done.</p>

  <p>He had a surplus of precious ores in his space ring, each one worth thirty to fifty thousand supreme life vitality life crystals. Some could even fetch a price as high as a hundred thousand!</p>

  <p>These Soul Sea Realm warriors were loaded and could definitely afford Luo Zheng's wares. To put into perspective, a divine kingdom's treasury usually had around two to three hundred thousand supreme life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng sold all his ores, he'd have an estimated profit of three million supreme life vitality crystals!</p>

  <p>He'd be richer than the entire divine kingdoms!</p>

  <p>Once he sold off his ores, Luo Luo Zheng took out the Soul Cores and handed them over to Turner.</p>

  <p>These Soul Cores served as the key to entering the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land. It was useless for him to keep them as he didn't know how to use them. It was enough for him to know that they would surely bring him into the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>Still, he was very much curious about how these Soul Cores were used to enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>The entire point of heading to the Feather Emperor Island for the Soul Sea Realm masters was to hunt for the mineral-devouring bugs in the hopes of obtaining at least one or two Soul Cores. They got lucky and were able to haul over a hundred which meant that they could send enough people to the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land and explore.</p>

  <p>"Alright! Since the Soul Cores have been distributed, it's time to set off for the Divine Emperor Secret Land! Tianxing, let me bring you along!"</p>

  <p>War King Wind boisterously laughed as he pulled Luo Luo Zheng to his side.</p>

  <p>Many of the Soul Sea Realm masters cursed War King Wind in their hearts, 'This old, cunning fox. Everyone knows that he's planning to draw Luo Luo Zheng to his side in order to gain the upper hand. He's probably going to swallow his pride and even offer his precious daughter up in the process..."</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't as if War King Wind hadn't stood up in Luo Zheng's defense before, so it was expected that Luo Luo Zheng would be partial to him.</p>

  <p>In truth, after reaching the Life and Death Realm, Luo Luo Zheng could now resist the blood sacrifice within the Feather Holy Sea. He had no need for anyone's assistance and could simply rely on his own strength but he couldn't just pass up War King Wind's offer so he accepted.</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment!" a voice called out. It was Marine who was rushing towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Marine was his only enemy within the four divine kingdoms and it was mainly because of her that he had been targeted by War Emperor York so he couldn't help but frown at the sight of her coming towards him.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked with a sullen expression.</p>

  <p>Marine smiled and took out a purple, diamond-shaped crystal.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" he asked, his guard up as Marine suddenly pointed the crystal at him.</p>

  <p>"Don't be afraid. I'm just using it to record your image," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"Image?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng repeated. He did not quite get what she was trying to do.</p>

  <p>Noticing his reluctance, Derek smiled and quickly explained to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The crystal in Marine's hand was the kind used in making Picture Slabs.</p>

  <p>It could record and store images but this one was special. This purple crystal had the capacity to pass through the Reverse Spirit Channel.</p>

  <p>As the Holy Maiden of the secret sect, Marine was the communicator between the Upper World and the Lower World. It was her job to deliver the news to the Upper World that a martial artist from the Divine Kingdom Continent was able to activate the Mahayana Lotus Flower and made a total of thirty-five petals come out.</p>

  <p>It was only then that Luo Luo Zheng finally understood why those Soul Sea Realm masters suddenly changed their attitudes towards him.</p>

  <p>He also briefly wondered which group of humans in the Upper World was Marine going to report to.</p>

  <p>Was it the group that Yolande belonged to? Maybe it was the group that Immortal Mist had been a part of? Or maybe it was another group entirely?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought it wise not to ask. He figured that it was better for him to play dumb given that he had never been to a supreme world that belonged to the human race in the Upper World nor did he know much about the strength of the human race there.</p>

  <p>Once Marine recorded his image and walked away, War King Wind waved his sleeve and let out a wave of life vitality. The powerful force wrapped around Luo Luo Zheng, Callan, Fiona, and the rest, dragging them up to the sky and pushing them into the depths of the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>The other powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors flew up to the sky while Randy, Bram, and a few others also left Feather Emperor Island.</p>

  <p>Not everyone could go to the Divine Emperor Secret Land. Due to the limited supply of Soul Cores the past few years, only a small number of Soul Sea Realm masters could go and explore.</p>

  <p>This time, thanks to Luo Luo Zheng, there were plenty of Soul Cores to be used which meant that, aside from the powerful Soul Sea Realm masters, a few of the younger generation were also given the chance to go to the Divine Emperor Secret Land.</p>

  <p>Of course, this chance was only extended to the crown princes and other royalty. The remaining divine-level talents could only return home.</p>

  <p>While flying through the sky, War King Wind seized the opportunity to chat with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was a bit weird having a stately ruler of a divine kingdom probe his background but Luo Luo Zheng politely answered all his queries despite feeling as if the questions came from a matchmaker rather than a king.</p>

  <p>It was when War King Wind asked Luo Luo Zheng if he was married did he finally understand why he was asking him all these questions.</p>

  <p>He glanced sideways to Fiona whose ears were obviously flushed red from embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"I'm not married," he replied with a smile. "But I have already pledged myself to a girl back home."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had already planned it all out. Once he returned to the Central Region, he would fulfill his promise to Ning Yudie and hold a grand wedding ceremony.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's reply painted a disappointed look on War King Wind's face. It was normal for men to have several wives and concubines; he himself had more than three thousand back in his palace. However, his daughter was a dignified princess of a divine kingdom. Although he had planned to arrange a marriage between Luo Luo Zheng and Fiona, he couldn't marry her to a man who already had a wife. That would mean that his darling daughter would only be a concubine.</p>

  <p>While War King Wind was still deep in thought, Fiona was red with fury at her father.</p>

  <p>She didn't like it that her father was trying to match make her with Luo Luo Zheng right in front of her. She'd always been an obedient daughter and even she was also a bit disappointed that Luo Luo Zheng was already engaged to another woman, she wished her father gave her a bit more face. "Father, there's no need to ask about this anymore."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I ask? I'm only doing this for your own good!" War King Wind smiled gently at his embarrassed daughter.</p>

  <p>Fiona could only glare at her father, her face full of conflicting emotions.</p>

  <p>Beauties had always admired heroes. This was proven true ever since ancient times and Fiona was no different. Ever since Luo Luo Zheng defeated her by the West Dragon River, the seed of love had already rooted itself deep in her heart. However, she was still too young, not even 20, and she was too shy to express the emotions she felt for him. Meanwhile, her father shamelessly tried to match make her to the object of her affections which was greatly embarrassing on her part.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the awkward moment was immediately dissipated by the black island that had appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>Despite being quite far from the island, everyone could already feel the malicious Mu Ning that emanated from it. This was one of the four secret lands of the Feather Holy Sea - the Divine Emperor Secret Land.</p>

  <p>Rather than just an island, this Divine Emperor Secret Land was so much more. It was a place of death - a graveyard of the Dragon Lineage Human.</p>

  <p>Millions of corpses littered this island graveyard.</p>

  <p>After the Dragon Lineage Human's blood sacrifice, all creatures turned into a cloud of bloody mist that became a powerful curse spread throughout the entire Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>The corpses were not living beings so they were not affected by the blood sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, if it wasn't for the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land, there would be nothing worth of interest in this Divine Emperor Secret Land.</p>

  <p>Sure, there might be a few valuable burial items but it wasn't anything a Soul Sea Realm master would be excited about.</p>

  <p>The power of the blood sacrifice in the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land was so strong that not even Soul Sea Realm masters could resist it. The only way to enter the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land was through the corpses of the Dragon Lineage Human which they could control with the use of the Soul Cores.</p>

  <p>This was precisely the reason why they had to go to the Divine Emperor Secret Land.</p>

  <p>Just as they landed, they found another batch of Soul Sea Realm masters already waiting.</p>
