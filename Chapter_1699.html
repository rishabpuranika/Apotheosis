<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1699 The Emotion Closing Godly Way </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Shania looked down at Zheng as she stood not far away from him. She sighed with emotion.</p>

  <p>Zheng was only around thirty years old...</p>

  <p>She found Zheng to be extremely young and exceptionally outstanding.</p>

  <p>The top ten in this world would all have great destinies.</p>

  <p>In return, they had to attain great achievements.</p>

  <p>The warrior chosen by Xun was indeed remarkable.</p>

  <p>As long as Zheng was alive, he would eventually be able to help Xun return to the throne of the Queen of Killings...</p>

  <p>"Losing in the Life-or-Death Space isn't considered a disgrace. On the contrary, it can prove that you are extremely persistent, and the warrior with the strongest determination is often the one who succeeds the most in the world... So, please admit defeat," Shania said calmly.</p>

  <p>Long, long ago, there was a legendary treasure in the Heavenly Lake Mountain. Only after warriors knelt for a thousand years would the legendary treasure appear before them.</p>

  <p>Many warriors went over to investigate out of curiosity, but they scoffed at the notion. They did not believe this rumor.</p>

  <p>However, several hundred other warriors stayed behind and knelt in front of the Heavenly Lake Mountain...</p>

  <p>After a year, almost everyone chose to leave, except one warrior, who stayed there steadfastly.</p>

  <p>The others mocked him because of his stupid stubbornness. Rumors were just rumors after all with no basis in facts. One thousand years was a precious amount of time for a warrior and he was silly to waste time like that.</p>

  <p>However, the warrior remained unmoved. He had knelt for more than one thousand years and wasn't going to give up just like that.</p>

  <p>Another one hundred years passed and the Heavenly Lake Mountain finally parted, revealing the treasure. It was bestowed upon the devoted warrior.</p>

  <p>This story was passed down through generations all throughout the universe. It was a legend.</p>

  <p>This legend taught everyone that even if persistence and determination were difficult and seemed unrewarding, one should work hard to pursue the goal with indomitable will. And one day, one would succeed!</p>

  <p>But if one decided to pursue something doggedly, they had to survive and thrive.</p>

  <p>In the past, Ying also made the Life-or-Death Space by taking advantage of this point, once she created the Circle of Life and Death.</p>

  <p>The Life-or-Death Space brought one closest to death. Faced with death, one's survival instincts would be on high alert!</p>

  <p>If one wanted to break through this Life-or-Death Space, they would need to contemplate life and death.</p>

  <p>But how could Zheng do this in such a short period of time? How could he make it in front of her? This was an impossible task to do.</p>

  <p>The rest of Shania's opponents were all newly-born talents from the last several decades. They had seen through life and death completely. How would they be able to make it?</p>

  <p>With one formidable move, Shania could defeat anyone.</p>

  <p>"Plop!"</p>

  <p>Another muffled sound was heard.</p>

  <p>Zheng was staring death in the face, so his fear became more and more intense. Besides, the influence on his mind was also increasingly getting stronger...</p>

  <p>Therefore, his heartbeat became more and more powerful, as if a cannon had exploded in his chest!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng's physical body was different than ordinary people's.</p>

  <p>If he weren't so strong, a single beat of his heart might have blown his chest out!</p>

  <p>Zheng staggered as he leaned on the thread, panting heavily.</p>

  <p>The injuries to his physical body were no big deal...</p>

  <p>However, the pressure in his heart was like a hammer that felt like it weighed a hundred mountains, squatting on his heart. It seemed like the hammer would rise and smash down heavily on him any minute.</p>

  <p>"Give up now. Hand over the Saint Killing Spear to me. I promise that I will help Xun reconstruct herself in the spirit embryo. I can also admit defeat in this battle..." Actually Shania wanted to say that she could support Xun and help her return to the throne, but after realizing that her cultivation base was only at the Soul Sea Realm, she did not say those words. Also it was not a wise idea for her to make an enemy of Yao.</p>

  <p>As she spoke, she approached Zheng and stretched out her hands towards him as though she was going to support him.</p>

  <p>In truth her greedy eyes were fixated on Zheng's space ring.</p>

  <p>If she killed Zheng, he would resurrect above the stone. She had to obtain the Saint Killing Spear before the outcome of the battle was revealed.</p>

  <p>But Zheng suddenly stood up, and the Thunder Wind Divine Sword swung out in front of him!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The blade of the sword swished and drew the outline of the half moon.</p>

  <p>At the same time, part of the half-moon outline grazed against Shania's finger.</p>

  <p>Her blood splattered out.</p>

  <p>She looked at the wound on her hand and a green light flashed. Thanks to the Life Law, the wound healed quickly.</p>

  <p>"You..." Shania was staring at Zheng with a confused look on her face.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, Zheng would also need to have dogged determination if he were to struggle with all his might. In this case, he should've suffered an even greater counterattack.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't seem to be affected by the Life-or-Death Space.</p>

  <p>'Has he already gained an insight into life and death so quickly?' she wondered to herself.</p>

  <p>It was impossible...</p>

  <p>Shania frowned slightly when she looked into Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>There was no trace of emotion in his eyes. He looked like a lifeless puppet.</p>

  <p>Shania was extremely sensitive to life energy.</p>

  <p>Only puppets looked lifeless and lacked emotion like that.</p>

  <p>Besides, Zheng's life energy was not dissipating at all...</p>

  <p>"Isn't it very strange?" Zheng coldly said. The edge of his Thunder Wind Divine Sword began to emit an icy light. "This Life-or-Death Space is indeed strange. It can even be used as a cultivation place."</p>

  <p>Some Soul Sea Realm warriors clearly knew that they wouldn't achieve good results, but they still chose to enter the Illusion Battlefield in order to train themselves. Facing the real test of life and death would be very helpful to them in future.</p>

  <p>"However, I do not need this kind of test for the time being," Zheng continued coldly.</p>

  <p>Shania was baffled. "But, how did you do it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng laughed arrogantly. "Those Godly Geniuses who have stepped in the Godly Way have their own internal momentum. Why can't I own my own Godly Way and internal momentum?"</p>

  <p>"What Godly Way?" Shania asked.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, Zheng's sword began to hum.</p>

  <p>There was a sword intent on the sword, which looked ready to burst forth any minute...</p>

  <p>"My Godly Way is... the Emotion Closing Godly Way!"</p>

  <p>Saying this, Zheng suddenly took a step forward, swung out the long sword in his right hand and pointed the tip at Shania!</p>

  <p>Since he moved too fast, the slender blade of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword got bent by air, and it looked like a small arched bridge. However, after this attack was initiated, Zheng shook the sword and made it straight again.</p>

  <p>And at the same time, the powerful Gods-intimidating Strike was unleashed!</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, Shania was astounded, her expression changing dramatically!</p>

  <p>She spun on the tip of her feet and glided back rapidly.</p>

  <p>She had only moved less than three steps away when she realized that the sword light was moving extremely fast. She could not escape it even though she retreated so rapidly!</p>

  <p>It was also because of her quick reflexes that she had jumped up after gliding three steps. She flipped in the air and managed to avoid the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng didn't give her the slightest chance. She flipped in the air and once again stepped on the thin thread. She pulled a long face.</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way...</p>

  <p>Be it obsession or fear, they were manifestations of human emotion.</p>

  <p>This was the most terrifying part of the Life-or-Death Space.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had comprehended the Emotion Closing Godly Way and completely cut off his emotions, so he had no trouble navigating this space!</p>

  <p>At this moment, there were no distracting thoughts in Zheng's mind. All of his emotions and desires had vanished, and there was no fear of death!</p>

  <p>Many warriors in the Humanity Alliance knew that Zheng had cultivated the Gods-intimidating Strike successfully.</p>

  <p>However, the news only spread around the thirteen palaces...</p>

  <p>And at that time, they didn't know that what Zheng had practiced was the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Strike was the Emotion Closing Godly Way?</p>

  <p>The warriors who had been affected by the sword cloud at that time were all stunned when they saw this scene.</p>

  <p>Some warriors had comprehended a small part of the Gods-intimidating Strike. They also knew that this sword strike was very powerful, but they never paid too much attention to it.</p>

  <p>For example, Layla had comprehended the strike a lot, but she attached more importance to what her master had taught her...</p>

  <p>She had never thought that Zheng was someone who would be able to comprehend the Emotion Closing Godly Way through the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>After all, only a few warriors knew that Sword Chen had become a True God. Most of the other warriors were under the impression that he had died.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has actually practiced the Emotion Closing Godly Way... Isn't it the forbidden Godly Way?" Tianming asked in surprise. He had guessed that Zheng had already stepped into the Godly Way but he never thought that Zheng would choose the forbidden Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"This sword attack is quite powerful." Nathan declared with a confident smile.</p>

  <p>Although he was full of praise for Zheng's sword strike, he was secretly comparing himself to Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng's Gods-intimidating Strike was powerful, but it probably consumed a lot of life vitality. Just now when he lay on the ground, it took him a long time to launch the attack. He might have already drained more than half of his sea of life vitality.</p>

  <p>No matter what, with this guy's cultivation, he would only be able to strike two or three times!</p>

  <p>"It is not that formidable," Nathan said indifferently. He always had absolute confidence in himself.</p>

  <p>But right after, he was astonished, and even his state of mind was slightly muddled.</p>
