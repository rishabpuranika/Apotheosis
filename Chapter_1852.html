<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had mastered the Primal Chaos Technique with his weapon-like body, and at the time, the inner world had undergone a fundamental change.</p>

  <p>If the Grand Weapon Refining Method allowed Luo Zheng to embark on a completely different path of body refinement, then the Primal Chaos Technique would allow him to embark on a completely different path of life vitality cultivation.</p>

  <p>The Genuine Dragons weren't sure if the inner world built on the foundation of chaos could really evolve into another divine land. They weren't even sure just how far Luo Zheng could go on this path.</p>

  <p>But they knew that if he continued on this path, Luo Zheng would reach heights that they couldn't even imagine.</p>

  <p>The strength source went down from Zheng's chest all the way to his cinnabar field and then into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Zheng's inner world had grown larger and larger, and the species that were born within it had become more and more abundant.</p>

  <p>An ape made its way through the bushes, feeding on sweet berries.</p>

  <p>This ape had already evolved into a bit of intelligence, and knew how to avoid some of the land's ferocious beasts and poisonous bugs. It was interested in getting to the end of the land, where the massive tree was.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be something special about that tree, something that exuded a great attractive force.</p>

  <p>But despite its strength, it still was unable to climb such a tall World Tree.</p>

  <p>The ape had harvested an impressive amount today. Once it had plucked quite a few berries, it decided to return to its cave. There were still some little apes there, crying out in joy.</p>

  <p>An explosion shook the ground, causing the ape to tremble in fear.</p>

  <p>It finally raised its head and looked up at the sky for the first time.</p>

  <p>The deep sky attracted the ape's attention. This was the first time that any living being within Zheng's inner world had consciously looked up at the sky.</p>

  <p>Just what kind of place was in the depths of the sky?</p>

  <p>What was that place outside the sky?</p>

  <p>The ape already knew how to think. But the concept of 'sky' did not exist in its mind.</p>

  <p>It was just instinctively curious and thinking.</p>

  <p>The explosion had barely died down when a colorful line appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>This line looked like a rainbow snake on the ground and frightened the ape.</p>

  <p>The snake circled in the air, as if it wanted to split the sky open.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the snake began to curl up into a ball, looking like some kind of unknown round fruit.</p>

  <p>The strength source was a fatal attraction for all living beings, even for those within Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>The fruit looked so tasty, the ape couldn't help but stretch out its hands towards the round ball in the sky. But it was too far away.</p>

  <p>A second round ball appeared not long after the first one had. And then the third, followed by a fourth and a fifth.</p>

  <p>The ape stretched out both its hands and folded one finger. Nine fingers meant there were nine balls in the sky.</p>

  <p>It had already known how to count.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the strange howls of fierce beasts rang through.</p>

  <p>The ape stopped looking at the sky. On this continent, although the ape was intelligent, it was no match for the ferocious beasts. It had to become smarter if it wanted to fight the ferocious beasts.</p>

  <p>It carried its harvest of berries as it followed a hidden path back to its cave.</p>

  <p>All living creatures on this piece of land were looking up at the sky.</p>

  <p>But creatures other than the ape found the most instinctual restlessness and the attraction from the strength source in the sky. They neither had the basic intelligence, nor did they know how to think.</p>

  <p>Vast amount of strength source gathered in the sky.</p>

  <p>The stars would now be constructed according to the red dragon's method.</p>

  <p>The inner world of a warrior contained all the elements of life, but no stars.</p>

  <p>Even the inner world of a True God didn't have any stars.</p>

  <p>Even if the True Gods who cultivated both body and life vitality in the divine land built Nine Divine Stars and had mature inner worlds, they still couldn't gather the Nine Divine Stars into their inner worlds.</p>

  <p>If any True God were to achieve this, he or she wouldn't be very far from becoming a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>As the nine stars continued to condense, they started to emit a bright rainbow-colored light, illuminating Zheng's inner world as he continuously absorbed the strength source.</p>

  <p>Teigan had only absorbed a few thousand drops of strength source, yet he was already close to saturation. And right now, he could only watch as Luo Zheng absorbed it.</p>

  <p>Teigan looked on in fascination, not having imagined the scene before in his wildest dreams.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been lying in this lake of strength source for a long time. Teigan felt that the amount of strength source Luo Zheng could absorb shouldn't be so much more than what he could absorb. Absorbing tens of thousands of drops were sufficient for Luo Zheng and wouldn't take more than thirty seconds.</p>

  <p>About an hour later, Luo Zheng was still lying with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you being too greedy? There's no need to force it if you can't absorb it."</p>

  <p>He was actually upset since he was able to absorb just a tiny bit of the strength source despite seeing so much. Teigan understood Zheng's thoughts very well.</p>

  <p>But their cultivation was limited and there was a limit to the amount of strength source they could bear.</p>

  <p>Even if Chapman were to personally come down here, it would be impossible for him to completely absorb a lake of strength source. It would be great if he could absorb even a thousandth of the strength source.</p>

  <p>But things were not over yet.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, he saw eight small vortexes appearing on Zheng's body. He saw the strength source continuously enter Zheng's body through the vortexes.</p>

  <p>"Eight Path Platforms! Ahh!"</p>

  <p>The refining technique that the Collapsing Mountain race employed was primitive. They did not know how to create Path Platforms. Constructing Eight Path Platforms and forging Nine Divine Stars were perfect ways of body refinement. The Collapsing Mountain race did not adopt these ways, which was why they had never created Path Platforms or built Nine Divine Stars.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race was a unique one. Although their body refinement method was primitive, it wasn't exactly bad. It was just that Teigan felt a little faint as he watched this scene. After all, the strength source that Luo Zheng absorbed was probably much greater than what he absorbed, twice as great, even.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng finally stopped absorbing the strength source a while later, but he still lay in the lake with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>"Still unwilling to come up?" Teigan asked, his eyes wide.</p>

  <p>He really didn't believe that Luo Zheng could absorb any more.</p>

  <p>But just as this thought crossed his mind, the lake formed from the strength source began to suddenly ripple.</p>

  <p>A huge whirlpool formed, with Luo Zheng at the center of it.</p>

  <p>One could only imagine the ferocity of Zheng's absorption of the strength source, given this turbulence.</p>

  <p>At this rate of absorption, 'drop' could no longer be used to measure it.</p>

  <p>"How is this possible?"</p>

  <p>Even if the entire Collapsing Mountain race jumped into the lake and began to frantically absorb the strength source, they still wouldn't be able to achieve such a result. How much strength source could this guy hold?</p>

  <p>Would he completely absorb all of it? It couldn't be!</p>

  <p>This terrifying thought suddenly occurred to Teigan.</p>

  <p>The Collapsing Mountain race relied on their strength source.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng were to completely absorb the strength source, things would not look good.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was at the center of this whirlpool as it churned. He continuously infused the strength source into his inner world and condensed it into the nine stars.</p>

  <p>The light of the nine stars became brighter and brighter, illuminating Zheng's inner world, to the point where it became hard to distinguish between these seven colors. They began to turn into a blinding light, the color of the sun. Zheng's body had produced seven suns.</p>

  <p>When the process of creating the Nine Divine Stars had reached a certain degree, Zheng's inner world began to tremble, and the chaotic sea began to surge.</p>

  <p>The seven suns emitted a massive gravitational force that triggered the tide in the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had stopped absorbing because even if his inner world was special, there was still a limit to the strength source he could bear. If he were to continue absorbing it, the gravitational force from the strength source could cause a mess within his inner world, and could even tear it apart.</p>
