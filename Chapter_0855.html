<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not an expert on Sea God Continent history, but he had a rough understanding of it thanks to Phoebe from the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was a very important place for the many races that lived in the Sea God Continent. It was a trial ground directly related to their survival.</p>

  <p>Due to the innate significance of the tower, it was only natural that the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place wanted to take possession of it. Unfortunately, that was not something the other races could allow.</p>

  <p>A sole race's occupation of the Tower of Sin was equal to killing off the other races. Therefore, it was something that must never be allowed to happen, which was why the control of the tower was relegated to different races who were able to get a seat at the top.</p>

  <p>Other than cultivating in the tower, the Dark Nether Cave at the foot of the tower was also equally important.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be denied that the Tower of Sin was an indispensable part of a talent's training path. And this was what made the Sea God Continent and the Central Region completely different.</p>

  <p>In order to maintain balance and order, various sacred places contended for their seats and shared joint control of the tower, so that it could be a feasible public training ground for their talents. Rules were agreed upon and set, so that warriors might be able to train and flourish.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Luo Zheng had just been given the right to eliminate anyone from the tower.</p>

  <p>From the war fighters on the lower floors to those so-called seat owners at the top, all of their lives were now in the palm of Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>Such power and responsibility had him tingling all over.</p>

  <p>"Now that I have passed the ultimate test, it is time for me to go out," he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course," the weapon spirit replied. "Remember. As a weapon spirit, I am an omnipresent entity within the Tower of Sin. If you want to exercise your right, just call me."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in understanding before heading for the entrance.</p>

  <p>Outside the Talent Tablet, the crowd continued waiting in bated breath for Luo Zheng's return.</p>

  <p>The amount of time he had spent inside was several times greater than that of the average person, and the people waiting for him were growing restless.</p>

  <p>Yolande had climbed up to the first row like Luo Luo Zheng, but it took her much less time.</p>

  <p>"Why hasn't Luo Luo Zheng come out yet?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe we don't need to kill him personally anymore. He may have already died inside."</p>

  <p>"This has never happened before. The Talent Tablet's test isn't dangerous.</p>

  <p>It's only a test of the limits of one's talent."</p>

  <p>The discussions upset Olivia. The humans were clearly under a lot of pressure, and they'd be plunged into a deeper crisis if Luo Luo Zheng did truly die inside.</p>

  <p>However, the buzz of speculation suddenly came to a halt when the wall suddenly began shaking.</p>

  <p>Olivia's thin eyebrows were suddenly raised in anticipation. "Is he out?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't just her. Elder Jing, Fabian, and Jarrod were also paying close attention.</p>

  <p>In fact, the humans, ogres, Demon Night, and all races were all nervously staring at the shaking wall.</p>

  <p>In front of everyone present, the words "Luo Luo Zheng Luo" that originally shone bright on the first row, suddenly disappeared!</p>

  <p>A loud uproar immediately followed, "Luo Zheng's name is gone! How could it have disappeared?"</p>

  <p>"What the hell? Did he really die inside?"</p>

  <p>"Bullshit! That can't be right. There was once a talent who was killed in the arena immediately after he stepped out of the Talent Tablet. His name didn't disappear."</p>

  <p>"How do you explain Luo Zheng's name disappearing then?"</p>

  <p>"Why are you asking me? I have no idea either."</p>

  <p>The disappearance of Luo Zheng's name resurrected the speculations of the audience who were once again abuzz with discussion.</p>

  <p>The names could be pushed down by the increasing number of names, but it was impossible for them to disappear.</p>

  <p>Only a few names were written on the first row. Yesterday, only five names were written on the first row and none of them were from the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>But in just one day, two names were suddenly added to the list.</p>

  <p>For thousands of years, the first row remained sparse, but the sudden entrance of talents changed it all in one single day. Perhaps the next talent would come tomorrow, or the next week, or maybe not until the next few thousand years. No one truly knew what the future held.</p>

  <p>However, one of the names had mysteriously disappeared. While the crowd gossiped and theorized, Olivia was almost trembling with worry as she continuously prayed in her heart for that young man's safety, 'Luo Luo Zheng? Luo Luo Zheng, please you have to be alright.'</p>

  <p>The tremors on the wall grew more intense, silencing the crowd once more.</p>

  <p>Specks of golden light began to appear above the first row and cracks began to form one after the other.</p>

  <p>The cracks grew larger before forming into coherent, golden words,</p>

  <p>'Celestial Position.'</p>

  <p>"What are those words?" "Celestial Position? What is that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but the light is really dazzling." It was true. The way Luo Zheng's name shone earlier was nothing compared to the bright, golden light the two words emanated as they were written on the wall.</p>

  <p>It wasn't over. Cracks continued to appear on the bottom of 'Celestial Position, ' shining and forming into two familiar words: ' Luo Luo Zheng Luo.'</p>

  <p>"Celestial Position,  Luo Luo Zheng Luo."</p>

  <p>"Do my eyes deceive me? Isn't that Luo Zheng's name? Luo Zheng's name just moved to the top of the entire list!"</p>

  <p>"Wow, and his name is even ten times larger than those below."</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng is truly too monstrous."</p>

  <p>The crowd was once again driven into stunned silence.</p>

  <p>"Celestial Position?"</p>

  <p>Malcom mouthed the words, face filled with shock as he looked up at the human's golden name.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Jarrod looked at each other in disbelief. "Fabian, do you remember the book of Celestial Position stored on top of the tower?" Jarrod asked.</p>

  <p>Fabian nodded in confirmation. "Yes," he said. "According to the book, the Tower of Sin used to belong to a race called the Celestial Position, but no further information is recorded." Jarrod shook his head and sighed, "I wonder just what Luo Luo Zheng has encountered when he took the test."</p>

  <p>"Ho-ho, whatever happened inside doesn't matter. His name is now above all these other talents!"</p>

  <p>Fabian said.</p>

  <p>The sight of Luo Zheng's name written in bold, golden letters erased all worries in Olivia's heart. Pride welled up at her chest and she felt as if she was about to cry. It was truly a prodigious moment for the entire human race.</p>

  <p>Even Dylon, who was extremely jealous of Luo Luo Zheng, also felt the excitement.</p>

  <p>For years, humans had been bullied inside the Tower of Sin. They all had to behave cowardly and learn their place because of their race's lackluster strength. Luo Zheng's accomplishments today changed all that, and they all felt as if they could finally walk the halls of the tower with their heads held high with no fear of persecution.</p>

  <p>"This talent of ours will be hard to beat."</p>

  <p>A lot of them wanted to roar out those words.</p>

  <p>Madeline's eyes gazed up icily at the golden name. The Demon Night was not a bloodthirsty race. They might be strong and arrogant at times, but they carried certain dignity in their bones.</p>

  <p>She was very happy for Luo Luo Zheng, truly, from the bottom of her heart. She was happy for him. It wasn't everyday one saw a talent such as him rise and make his way to the top. She truly wanted to see just how far this human boy she had never even met would go.</p>

  <p>However, there was still a bigger matter to consider. The human race's reproduction rate was far greater than the Demon Night's. Given their larger population, their chances of fostering more talents would be much higher than theirs or even the ogres'.</p>

  <p>That possibility threatened the survival of her entire race, so, despite being happy for Luo Luo Zheng, she still hoped for the ogres' swift elimination of the human boy.</p>

  <p>'Let nature take its course, ' Madeline thought to herself. A high talent such as Luo Luo Zheng was no doubt also endowed with great fortune. The ogres would have a hard time killing him.</p>

  <p>But there was still that challenge from Boris.</p>

  <p>Should Luo Luo Zheng defeat Boris in the arena, the ogres would then gain the perfect excuse to not abide by the rules and kill him directly. With Malcom's strength as a tenth-level war lord, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>And, even if Fabian and Jarrod were able to protect Luo Luo Zheng, there was still the matter of the ogres holding the majority of the seats in the tower.</p>

  <p>Four human seat owners against over twenty ogre seat owners? It would be like eggs dashing themselves against rocks.</p>

  <p>No matter how great Luo Zheng's luck was, he had now truly reached a dead end.</p>

  <p>From how Madeline saw it, the human boy was doomed. A slight smirk found its way on her face with this conclusion.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was admiring the golden words on the wall, the door finally opened.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng entered, a small crowd of people saw him off. Now, as he made his exit, the small crowd had become a black mass of creatures from all manner of races.</p>

  <p>He was taken aback at the sight, "Why are there so many?"</p>

  <p>He quickly looked around and was immediately comforted at the familiar sight of Olivia and walked over to her.</p>

  <p>Olivia's eyes were watery as if she had been holding her tears the entire time. "You're f-finally out," she said, her gentle voice trembling.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned. "What's wrong?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Olivia shook her head and smiled before pointing behind him, "Look over there."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng turned his head and was immensely shocked at the sight of the two golden words that had been carved onto the stone wall. He knew that the weapon spirit was the one who wrote his name there, but was it really necessary to make his name so big? Wasn't that too arrogant?</p>

  <p>He was speechless. Had he known that this would happen, he would've had stopped the weapon spirit from doing so.</p>
