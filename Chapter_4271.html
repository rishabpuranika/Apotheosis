<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4271 Magnetic Light Extreme Form </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish swam around the four pillars, searching earnestly.</p>

  <p>It had initially only planned to exhaust Luo Nian's strength.</p>

  <p>It figured this was the most efficient way to deal with him and Ziya. Ziya would have been easy pickings after that.</p>

  <p>But the Starry Roc-fish hadn't expected Luo Nian to use Grand Teleportation to escape.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish could detect objects using the aura of space, but the Heavenly Ring Staff was obviously shielding Luo Nian and Ziya. It took some time for the Starry Roc-fish's echolocation ability to lead it toward the general direction of the pillars.</p>

  <p>It began to sense Luo Nian and Ziya in the area as soon as it approached.</p>

  <p>But suddenly, the two became undetectable again.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish had such keen senses that it could see the energy emanating from everything in the world, including from dead people. It could easily pick up on energy fluctuations, too.</p>

  <p>Avoiding its detection like this would usually require those in hiding to block all external energy auras and stop emitting auras themselves.</p>

  <p>Suffice to say, that was a near impossible feat.</p>

  <p>That was why the Starry Roc-fish concluded Luo Nian and Ziya must be using the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>It was likely why the Starry Roc-fish couldn't find them now.</p>

  <p>But it had to, all the same. It couldn't disobey the downgrader's orders.</p>

  <p>"Woo..."</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish emitted a long wailing sound.</p>

  <p>The sound waves bounced back from surfaces, allowing the Starry Roc-fish to determine the shape of its surroundings, including those concealed.</p>

  <p>The sound waves washed through a vast area. But it still failed to pick up on Luo Nian and Ziya.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish figured it must be looking in the wrong area.</p>

  <p>It turned to go.</p>

  <p>Just then, a door suddenly opened above the Eternal Divine Courtyard. A white light emanated from the doorway.</p>

  <p>The light began to flash, and the voice of the downgrader piped up directly in the Starry Roc-fish's mind, "Wait there!"</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish didn't know what it had to wait for, but it couldn't refuse. It hovered in place for a moment.</p>

  <p>Soon, it saw a person being dropped from above. The person landed on the roof of the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>The white light flashed again. "Give it your all and kill him!" the downgrader commanded.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish was left a little puzzled at that.</p>

  <p>The human in front of it looked extremely weak. He seemed to be just a third-grade creature who had not even undergone the Red Jade Rite. It didn't look like it would take much to kill him.</p>

  <p>But the Starry Roc-fish just did what it was told.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>Five-colored lightning bolts started swirling around the Starry Roc-fish's sharp head.</p>

  <p>The more bolts there were, the more powerful the force became.</p>

  <p>"Woo..."</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish emitted the echolocation sound again to lock in on its target. It released the lightning.</p>

  <p>All this time, Luo Nian and Ziya had been arching their backs and running on the chain, hiding successfully from the Starry Roc-fish.</p>

  <p>They had heaved a sigh of relief when they saw the Starry Roc-fish turn to leave, but felt confused when it had suddenly stopped in place, as if waiting for something.</p>

  <p>That was when they saw the door open and Luo Zheng drop down like a corpse.</p>

  <p>"Father!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian couldn't help but hiss urgently as he saw the Starry Roc-fish preparing to zap Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The five-colored lightning enveloped Luo Zheng completely.</p>

  <p>The light bloomed over the entire courtyard.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish was not worried that the Eternal Divine Courtyard would be destroyed. It was, after all, under the Time Lock.</p>

  <p>It did feel, however, that using the five-colored lightning on a barely conscious human was a bit too much. It would have chosen a milder technique had the downgrader not directed it to use maximum force.</p>

  <p>The five-colored lightning exploded in one blow then died down quickly.</p>

  <p>But the blinding light cleared up only to reveal the man completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>"I told you to give it your all! Even the brush-wielder couldn't do much damage!" The downgrader's voice chastised the Starry Roc-fish.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish was surprised to hear that. The brush-wielder wasn't that powerful, but as the ruler of the Eternal Scroll Painting, he was omnipotent there.</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish took on a more resolute attitude. "Alright, then."</p>

  <p>The five-colored lightning appeared around its head again. But this time, the colors were much deeper, the energy contained therein much stronger.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng started to come around. Even in a state of unconsciousness, he had still felt that powerful jolt of force.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, his body had been strong enough to withstand it.</p>

  <p>The core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization was now working on overdrive to assess his surroundings. Luo Zheng saw a colorful roc-fish floating in the sky. He felt like he had seen it before.</p>

  <p>"It's the Starry Roc-fish!"</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish had not been hostile to him the first time he had met it in the Soul City, so Luo Zheng figured the downgrader probably had something to do with why the creature was attacking him now.</p>

  <p>As the Starry Roc-fish was charging up for a second strike, Luo Zheng staggered back to his feet.</p>

  <p>Were it not for the core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization, Luo Zheng probably wouldn't be able to do this. After all, it took Ziya many chaotic eras before he succeeded at this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's mind raced as he thought of ways to be able to deflect the looming attack even in his disoriented condition.</p>

  <p>The deep-colored lightning bolts were now heading for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Just die already!" the Starry Roc-fish said.</p>

  <p>Before the lightning could hit Luo Zheng, however, thin metal strands sprouted all over his body, forming a cage around him.</p>

  <p>The metal strands deflected the lightning bolts and sent them crackling throughout the Eternal Divine Courtyard instead. Luo Zheng was once again left unharmed.</p>

  <p>"What was that?"</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish was stunned.</p>

  <p>No one had ever dodged its lightning strikes like that before!</p>

  <p>"If that doesn't work, let's try the Magnetic Light Extreme Form, then."</p>

  <p>The Starry Roc-fish flicked its tail. Two thin rays of light spiraled toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Magnetic Light Extreme Form was not organic to the Starry Roc-fish.</p>

  <p>It actually came from the downgrader's theurgy and the power of the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>The core of Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been accurate thus far in its analyses of this situation.</p>

  <p>That was why when Luo Zheng saw the light rays, his first reaction was to run.</p>

  <p>But he was still unsteady on his feet. His first steps forward were clumsy, making him an easy target. One of the light rays pierced through his arm, the other through his foot.</p>

  <p>The body parts that the light rays hit were quickly turned into pure energy and absorbed.</p>

  <p>It made quick work of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In a flash, he had lost a hand and a foot.</p>

  <p>The light rays now rapidly began to spread from Luo Zheng's limbs to his torso.</p>

  <p>"Father!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian cried out in panic, completely forgetting he was supposed to be in hiding.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's entire body would soon be turned into pure energy at this rate!</p>
