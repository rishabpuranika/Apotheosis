  <p>
</p>

  <p>With a mere wave of Luo Zheng's hand, the colorful arrow dissipated into streaks of colors as they made their way back to the nine stars!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng gazed downward again as he sneered at the puny attack on him.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that someone with such talent was born in his inner world. The Evil God already knew of his existence. On his own, he had actually created nine divine textures which he had sent to each of the nine stars. He had planned to kill Luo Luo Zheng using the power of the nine stars once Luo Luo Zheng entered into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Disregarding the fact that the Evil God didn't have an inch of chance in winning against him, Luo Luo Zheng was still praising him for being able to put up a fight until this point.</p>

  <p>"Let me see if you really are a stunning and extraordinary person." Luo Luo Zheng laughed coldly and continued to move towards that continent.</p>

  <p>Due to Luo Zheng's presence and support, the human race within the inner world had no competition in regards to their power.</p>

  <p>Smack in the middle of that continent was a Law Tablet that Luo Luo Zheng had intentionally flung down in the past. Currently, this tablet resided in the palace which was built upon the highest place. The tablet was even considered a divine object, as it was impossible for ordinary martial artists to comprehend the Law Tablet!</p>

  <p>Even though these creatures were born and existed inside Luo Zheng's inner world, he had no control over their thoughts or ability to dictate their behavior.</p>

  <p>To hoard treasure or anything precious and keep it for oneself was the natural instinct of almost all creatures!</p>

  <p>Atop the highest mountain, on its very peak, a massive altar was built.</p>

  <p>Multitudes of martial artists gathered around it; they constantly knelt down and worshiped a statue on the altar. Upon closer look, it was the statue of the Evil God himself.</p>

  <p>"He's gathering the Faith Energy..."</p>

  <p>After the Evil God cultivated himself to the maximum level he could reach within Luo Zheng's inner world, his cultivation base was no longer able to increase.</p>

  <p>Because Luo Luo Zheng had only reached the world lord level, the Evil God's cultivation base could only reach the Spirit Transformation Realm. If he wanted to become stronger, the Evil God had actually thought of utilizing the Faith Energy!</p>

  <p>Currently, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't in need of any Faith Energy. Lacking a Godly Tile, he wouldn't be able to utilize the Faith Energy within his inner world.</p>

  <p>Only after condensing his own Godly Tile would the Faith Energy become available for him to use, and his strength would increase by a whole level!</p>

  <p>But given the Evil God's ongoing attempt to gather the Faith Energy of the entire world, it did not bode well for Luo Luo Zheng. After all, Faith Energy was limited, and if the Evil God continued to siphon it off using his own idol, it would have long-lasting effects on the world. By then, it would be difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to reverse the effects.</p>

  <p>On one side of that tall mountain was a palace.</p>

  <p>Supported by three stone pillars, each twenty thousand feet in length, the entire palace gave the impression that it was completely suspended in midair. If one was to stand on the outermost circular balcony of the palace, the coastline of the eastern continent could be seen.</p>

  <p>On this balcony stood two people: a man and a woman. The man was stoic, a cold expression on his face. The woman was delicate, beautiful, slim, and graceful.</p>

  <p>This man was considered by everyone as the strongest person in the world; the title "Evil God" was given to him by the people. The woman was the princess of the Sky Defending Empire and also the wife of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"He's here. The power of nine stars indeed has no effect on him..." The Evil God's gaze was calm and collected. He knew that he was up for a fight with a strong opponent that he might not be able to defeat; that opponent was also the God of Creation of this world!</p>

  <p>The woman leaned her head on the Evil God's broad shoulder, worry etched in her features. "From the historical records we have, it seems that this person is philanthropic. Do you really need to make an enemy out of him?"</p>

  <p>When he heard this, the Evil God's expression became proud and aloof.</p>

  <p>"I pursue freedom in my whole life, and I don't want to be ruled by anyone else. I have always been the only one who controlled others; I cannot permit anyone else to be in control of my destiny!"</p>

  <p>In preparation for his fight against Luo Luo Zheng, the Evil God was required to do a lot of things. He had collected some of the traces Luo Luo Zheng left behind in history; he had also found some key facts from legends, and even dared to estimate Luo Zheng's strength.</p>

  <p>"But he is significantly stronger than you," the woman softly reminded him.</p>

  <p>The Evil God laughed coldly. "Indeed. The difference between our strengths might not really be so large. I am the only one who has reached the Spirit Transformation Realm in the entire world. According to my calculations, there should only be two great realms above the Spirit Transformation Realm. After transcending these two realms, one's cultivation level would have already reached the end!"</p>

  <p>Spirit Supreme Realm warriors and world lords did not exist in this world. However, the Evil God had relied on his own ability and was able to deduce that Luo Luo Zheng was a world lord, even though he had no idea of what a world lord was and the extent of a world lord's strength.</p>

  <p>He also wasn't aware that there were higher levels than the world lord level: Supreme Lord, True God, and Holy Being. After all, the Evil God was only a part of Luo Zheng's inner world, but it was already extraordinary for him to be able to assume that there were two more great realms.</p>

  <p>"With the strength I currently have, I can still defeat my opponent even if he is stronger than me. He may be two levels stronger than me, but using my previously prepared arrangement, I still have a chance to triumph over him!" the Evil God pronounced coldly, his eyes filled with determination.</p>

  <p>What he did not know was that once Luo Luo Zheng really perished, this entire inner world would be destroyed as well. Everything in this world would collapse, eventually dissipating into the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng traced a thin line in midair and crossed over the mountain. He circled above the palace and flew towards the balcony at the perimeter of the palace. He caught sight of the man on the balcony, and he looked down upon him.</p>

  <p>"Are you... the Evil God?" Luo Luo Zheng asked flatly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's mouth turned up into a smile. He immediately embraced the woman in his arms and leaped into the air with her. He jumped onto a higher-level space and looked down at Luo Luo Zheng. Only then did he laugh in response. "That's right. I am the Evil God!"</p>

  <p>"Disperse your totem that collects the Faith Energy, and dissolve your Evil Cloud Sacred Place. Do these and I will spare your life; otherwise, you will die," Luo Luo Zheng warned.</p>

  <p>The woman only blinked her eyes and stared at the God of Creation hundreds of feet away from them; she did not say anything. As she had read through many historical records, this God of Creation had a reputation for being kind; he had also repeatedly prevented martial artists from killing each other. It was also known that it was him who condensed the laws that he had comprehended into the Law Tablets and erected them all over the world to let martial artists comprehend and cultivate.</p>

  <p>In her heart, the woman did not really want to make an enemy of the God of Creation. After all, he created this world and every living being in it!</p>

  <p>However, it was her husband who had a great ambition. He didn't want to be trapped and limited in this small world. He knew that there was a greater space in the outside world. He even predicted that there were beings who existed in the outside world that were stronger than the God of Creation.</p>

  <p>Thus, she and her husband could only come up with a crazy plan to exterminate the God.</p>

  <p>Trying to kill Luo Luo Zheng using the power of nine stars was only a preliminary step. They expected that it was naturally bound to fail. However, the moment that the woman saw Luo Luo Zheng, she had a feeling in her heart that her husband was bound to lose...</p>

  <p>"Spare my life?" The Evil God laughed and added, "From the day I was born, no one has been able to get a chance to kill me. Even you are not qualified to do so!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brows knitted slightly when he heard this.</p>

  <p>He cared greatly for the creatures in his inner world. If the Evil God agreed to his request, he would be able to let him off. Countless times, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't willing to disrupt the balance in his inner world; he just let the creatures develop on their own.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, this Evil God indeed possessed extraordinary creativity and talent; he also had the qualifications and the right to be arrogant. It was a pity that he did not have an inkling of how arrogant he was...</p>

  <p>"Then I'd like to personally check if I'm qualified enough," Luo Luo Zheng spoke with great curiosity. He wanted to see what the Evil God could accomplish.</p>
