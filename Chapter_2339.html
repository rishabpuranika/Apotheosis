<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The arrows formed from Zheng's soul pressure were extremely sharp.</p>

  <p>In fact, Zheng's current cultivation base was so powerful that the small arrows transformed from his soul pressure could probably cut and injure some of the low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>The soul was far weaker than the physical body, so if the low-rank True Gods could get injured, there was no way the Soul-killing Ghosts would be able to survive the arrows.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the Soul-killing Ghosts that were closest to Zheng were pierced by the many small arrows from his soul pressure and suffered torture.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul arrows shot out in all directions, some of them reaching up to several thousand feet!</p>

  <p>But since Zheng was in his soul form now, no one could see the arrows except for the Soul-killing Ghosts and Nelly. The other True Gods could only sense Zheng's location with their spiritual perception and notice the extremely sharp and powerful soul pressure that was emanating from where Zheng was.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Some of the small soul arrows pierced right through the Soul-killing Ghosts and continued flying toward the stump below the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>Reginald gently reached out and blocked the arrows with his broad hand.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, he heard a muffled sound. Although these soul arrows hadn't hurt him, the power they had emitted shocked him. "Is this the soul pressure released by Tianxing? It's so powerful!"</p>

  <p>Other than Reginald, a few other True Gods were also hit by the soul arrows. However, since they had already been flying for a few seconds, they had lost most of their power and did not hurt anyone.</p>

  <p>But the Soul-killing Ghosts crawling on the ground below were in trouble!</p>

  <p>Countless arrows shot toward them before they even had time to dodge, killing them instantly.</p>

  <p>Nelly's soul, which was in the crutches of the Soul-killing Ghosts, was curling up. At this moment, Nelly's mind was blank and she could barely remember anything from her life.</p>

  <p>All she knew was that she didn't want to die here. She still wanted to become the Mu Clan's top warrior and as excellent as Rachelle, who she had always looked up to as an example. She was confident that she could do it because she was just as talented as Rachelle.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, she would lose everything once her soul shattered.</p>

  <p>A wave of indescribable pain spread over her, making her feel like her soul was being torn into pieces. It was really miserable that she had to die such a painful death.</p>

  <p>However, just as she felt the darkness enveloping her, she sensed a strong soul pressure quickly approaching her.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Soul-killing Ghosts which were devouring her soul were pierced by the arrows.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The soul arrows pierced all the Soul-killing Ghosts around her, causing them to transform into traces of pure soul force that floated aimlessly behind her.</p>

  <p>After the Soul-killing Ghosts were destroyed, Nelly's soul struggled to get up. She wondered where the powerful soul force that had just saved her had come from.</p>

  <p>When she turned around in curiosity and gratitude, she saw a soul shining with golden light.</p>

  <p>Golden sword shadows were continuously revolving around that soul.</p>

  <p>Every time that golden light flashed, soul arrows shot toward her.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>More and more Soul-killing Ghosts around her were destroyed.</p>

  <p>At last, Nelly's soul was safe and sound.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo?"</p>

  <p>After staring at the golden soul for a long time, Nelly gradually came back to her senses and recognized Zheng. She had never expected that Zheng's soul could be so powerful!</p>

  <p>As far as she knew, even the soul pressure of a top-rank True God couldn't be this strong. That was why all the top-rank True Gods in the valley had chosen to escape.</p>

  <p>How could Tianxing's soul pressure be so powerful?</p>

  <p>The golden soul slowly approached Nelly's while continuously shooting the soul arrows. Then, Zheng lifted her up from the ground and dragged her to her physical body.</p>

  <p>Her soul had been torn and injured by the Soul-killing Ghosts, but it was nothing serious. Once her soul was close enough to her physical body, it returned to her mind in a flash.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not willing to remain in the soul state either. Now that the Soul-killing Ghosts had been dealt with, he quickly returned to his mind.</p>

  <p>When he opened his eyes, his eyes once again glowed with a golden light.</p>

  <p>Since the Emotion Closing Godly Way had been revealed, he had no scruples anymore.</p>

  <p>Killing Soul-killing Ghosts could strengthen his soul power quickly and by a large amount, so he had decided that it was worth the risk of revealing the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>In fact, many of the warriors who had run to the tree stump had used the power of thunder and lightning to kill the Soul-killing Ghosts for the same reason that it would strengthen their soul power. Everyone had wanted to seize this opportunity. However, since they had been far away from the Soul-killing Ghosts, none of them had managed to kill nearly as many Soul-killing Ghosts as Zheng had.</p>

  <p>Anyway, Zheng was a unique case. Any Soul-killing Ghost that was within his line of sight was shot and killed.</p>

  <p>The Soul-killing Ghosts were unusually agile. Crawling on the ground, they fled in all directions since they realized that they were no match for Zheng. However, this valley was not that large, so they had nowhere to escape.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Zheng began to chase them!</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land all focused their eyes on Zheng with a mixture of emotions flashing through them.</p>

  <p>"It seems that this little guy has cultivated the Emotion Closing Godly Way," the Li Clan's Holy Being said nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The only way to strengthen the soul pressure to this extent is to use the Emotion Closing Godly Way," another Demi-holy Being said, nodding.</p>

  <p>"The Emotion Closing Godly Way is a forbidden Godly Way. Its Godly Way Tablet was sealed away more than a hundred divine eras ago. In addition, all the True Gods who cultivated it were annihilated. Even counterfeit tablets of the Emotion Closing Godly Way don't exist anymore. How did this guy cultivate the Emotion Closing Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>The Holy Being of the Fang Clan was bewildered.</p>

  <p>Nicholas also frowned. "This little fellow has never used the Emotion Closing Godly Way before, and I have never noticed the internal momentum of the Emotion Closing Godly Way from him. Could it be that he just inadvertently obtained the soul cultivation method of the Emotion Closing Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>"You are right. Maybe his cultivation method is separate from the Emotion Closing Godly Way, and even he has no idea of it." Samuel pitched in with the discussion.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Clark said with a sarcastic laugh. "He probably didn't use the Emotion Closing Godly Way before because he knows that it is forbidden. Just now, he passively used the Emotion Closing Godly Way to circulate his soul force and kill the Soul-killing Ghosts because he was in a desperate situation. He was forced to do that in order to survive.</p>

  <p>Who knows which level of the Emotion Closing Godly Way he has reached?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas nodded, but he didn't look fully convinced. "After he comes out, we have to ask him to explain this matter."</p>

  <p>It wasn't because a low-rank True God had cultivated the Emotion Closing Godly Way that the Holy Beings felt threatened. The Emotion Closing Godly Way had long been regarded as a forbidden Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Hall of Holy Beings knew and accepted that. No one was allowed to cultivate this Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, even if Zheng had really cultivated the Emotion Closing Godly Way, it wouldn't be a big problem in Nicholas's eyes. After all, Nicholas was the one who had banned anyone from cultivating it.</p>

  <p>If he were to take Zheng as a disciple, he would be able to remove Zheng's Emotion Closing Godly Way, or even erase his memory of it.</p>

  <p>Now, the most important thing that Nicholas wanted to know was where Zheng had learned the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>
