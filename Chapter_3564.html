  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before leaving the Myriad Spirits City, Luo Zheng had called back Clyde and Raul.</p>

  <p>Raul now waited anxiously, pacing back and forth at the City Guard House, carrying a thick metal club.</p>

  <p>No one dared approach him except for Clyde, the leader of the Guide Weasel race. The full force of Raul's manic attack was enough to smash any living being.</p>

  <p>He and his team had been about to take over the Sky Water City when Luo Zheng's order came a few days ago.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this made him restless. It left a bitter taste in his mouth.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, he really was worried about Luo Zheng's and Feng Ge's safety.</p>

  <p>The Dark Region was much more dangerous than the Light Region. One couldn't act too rashly lest they risk their chance of survival.</p>

  <p>At some point in the past few days, Raul had wanted to take the Giants to try to seize the Sky Water City again, but he had been stopped by Clyde.</p>

  <p>Clyde refused to act without Luo Zheng's authorization. He was unconcerned about the remaining forces in the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>As Raul grew more anxious, Luo Zheng and Feng Ge finally returned to the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>As soon as Raul laid eyes on Luo Zheng, he rushed over to him, alight with excitement. "Sir, you're back safe and sound!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that Raul's excitement was more about what his return implied for the Giant race, but the fact that an Other Shore creature was so concerned about his safety still touched him.</p>

  <p>Inside the City Guard House hall, the core figures of the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race now gathered.</p>

  <p>Clyde thought for a long time before posing his burning question to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"When will you attack the Sky Water City, Sir?"</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures of the Myriad Spirits City apparently didn't know that Luo Zheng had already been there. Luo Zheng told them this now.</p>

  <p>"What?" Clyde was surprised by this.</p>

  <p>"The Star Falcon race already fled the Sky Water City. You can bring your people to take it over. No one will put up any resistance," Luo Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon race's escape, of course, was futile. They were still on Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>After losing their base and suffering a heavy blow from Luo Zheng, they would not be able to recover immediately.</p>

  <p>The only small mercy for them was that Luo Zheng had no interest in hunting down their remaining members himself. He left it to the large races of the Sky Water City and the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Three days later, the Giant race and the Guide Weasel race took control of the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, just as Luo Zheng had said, no one even tried to stop them from entering the city. In fact, the several large races in the city were scrambling to join them.</p>

  <p>These large races would have posed some difficulty if they had decided to fight back as a united force. Clyde and Raul knew very well the only real reason they were able to take over the Sky Water City so smoothly was because of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Hence, Luo Zheng had now occupied the only two cities of Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>After the takeover of the Sky Water City, he invited the Li Shan mountain to establish a stronghold in the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain initially refused. They had seen no need for strongholds in any cities over the years.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng persuaded them to change their minds. He didn't want Yan to have to be so far away from him anymore.</p>

  <p>With these developments, Stage Fourteen had effectively fallen into the control of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, or rather Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Land of Sword Grief were elated by the news.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace could never have imagined having this much influence in Stage Fourteen just two months ago.</p>

  <p>The disciples on the first floor were now all in respectful awe of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A new month began a few days later.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Land of Sword Grief, during this period, all disciples would automatically obtain a right to challenge other disciples on the same floor to determine their rankings.</p>

  <p>The top ten disciples all coveted the number one spot held by Luo Zheng, and were intent on displacing him from the top rank.</p>

  <p>They weren't able to do so at the beginning of last month because of Luo Zheng's closed-door cultivation. No one on the first floor had dared to disturb him.</p>

  <p>But since today marked the beginning of another new month, the disciples on the first floor all either paused or finished their cultivation to challenge their opponents. The arena behind the bronze building was now teeming with disciples.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also came to the arena, coming out of the room meant for the top rank and making his way to the front of the audience.</p>

  <p>His arrival attracted many people's attention.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has finished his cultivation!"</p>

  <p>"Is he going to challenge someone this time?"</p>

  <p>"Will he challenge someone on the second floor?"</p>

  <p>"That's possible!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng ignored the hubbub around him and kept his eyes on the ongoing match in the arena.</p>

  <p>Chaim was facing off with a senior disciple of the Land of Sword Grief, Layton Zhao, who was ranked 600th.</p>

  <p>Chaim was a newcomer exercising his right of challenge only for the second time, but he already had the guts to challenge someone holding the 600th spot.</p>

  <p>The newcomers had actually been all performing well, so far. Feng Ge, Ling Shuang, Milo and some others had made it to the top 1, 000 at the beginning of last month, which was an admirable accomplishment.</p>

  <p>The only reason their stellar performance largely went unrecognized was Luo Zheng, of course, outshone them all.</p>

  <p>Clap! Clap! Clap!</p>

  <p>On the arena, Chaim hovered around Layton, moving like a gale.</p>

  <p>Without using their Other Shore Tokens, they competed on physical strength and fighting techniques alone.</p>

  <p>Layton had an absolute advantage in terms of physical strength, but his bodily movement skill was not as good as Chaim's. Every time he tried to approach Chaim, Chaim would deftly dodge.</p>

  <p>Layton became a little impatient with Chaim's evasion.</p>

  <p>He quickened his pace, meaning to force Chaim into a dead corner.</p>

  <p>But it seemed Chaim could see through Layton's plan. With a slight twist of his shoulder, he flashed past Layton like a nimble fish.</p>

  <p>Layton didn't expect this move. He inadvertently left his back exposed.</p>

  <p>Chaim wouldn't miss such an opening.</p>

  <p>He stopped mid-air and turned, gathering all his strength into three palm strikes on Layton.</p>

  <p>"Take this!"</p>

  <p>Chaim's every move was calculated. The reason he dared to make this challenge was that he had merged with a new Other Shore Token in Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>The power given by the Other Shore Token from the Desire World was much stronger than that in the Lust World. This was what made Chaim so confident.</p>

  <p>The three palm strikes were powerful. Each palm strike contained nearly three thousand Jun of force, and they overlapped with each other, magnifying their strength.</p>

  <p>Layton reached the Chaotic Source Realm a long time ago. With long-term cultivation, the Chaotic Source Spirits in his body had already made great progress. But even he couldn't put up a resistance in time.</p>

  <p>The powerful palm force on his back slammed into his body. The Chaotic Source Spirits in his body started to lose energy. As the impact surged within him, he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>Chaim had won the match. He turned to Layton and straightened up, his hands cupped neatly in front of him. "I won," Chaim said, with a curt bow.</p>

  <p>Layton felt dejected. Losing to a newcomer was always humiliating. But he suddenly remembered Cleon, who had also lost to a newcomer. He started to feel a little better. He nodded civilly back to Chaim and left the arena.</p>

  <p>"Layton was defeated?"</p>

  <p>"We can't underestimate Chaim. He has only been in the Land of Sword Grief for one and a half months, but he has already been able to defeat someone of a much higher rank!"</p>

  <p>"No matter how powerful he is, though, he is still no match for Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>When Chaim overheard this, he smiled sheepishly to himself.</p>

  <p>The new Other Shore Token that he had merged with was a gift from the Ear Mouse race. And they only gave it to him because of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, everyone in the whole Myriad Spirits City was trying to get on Luo Zheng's good graces.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, before entering the Chaotic Source World, Chaim had once thought he might have a chance against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>By now, of course, he had realized how foolish it was to ever think that.</p>
