<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was not much time for Nicholas to ponder over Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had managed to bring hundreds of thousands of Cold Fiends up with him, but by now, they had scattered in all directions, and some of them were even heading downward.</p>

  <p>Waves of cold air filled the space. If Nicholas stayed here a little longer, he would be shrouded by dozens or even hundreds of gusts of cold wind!</p>

  <p>No matter what doubts or suspicions he had in his mind, he had to kill Zheng while he still had the chance.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!"</p>

  <p>As he approached Zheng, he suddenly stretched out his hands.</p>

  <p>Two strands of power, one black and one white, spiraled out of his body like two dragons. Soon, they turned into a torrent that rushed toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>The torrent covered a large distance in a matter of milliseconds.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng had read Nicholas's Memory Flame and predicted his attack in advance, he still wouldn't have been able to escape this torrent; it was much faster than he was.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>As the torrent shot toward him, Zheng's face slightly darkened.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>As he retreated, his long sword appeared in his hand, and his cold eyes filled with determination.</p>

  <p>"Ways-blending Energy!"</p>

  <p>Slash!</p>

  <p>Right now, Zheng had to go all out to fight Nicholas.</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate that he couldn't turn into a Wild God and become tens of thousands of feet tall. The Cold Fiends were spitting cold air in all directions. If he became a giant at this place, he would soon be turned into a huge ice sculpture!</p>

  <p>However, before he could strike with his sword, a slender figure suddenly fell from above and blocked him from the attack.</p>

  <p>The mysterious woman had finally gotten rid of the Cold Fiends' fierce attacks.</p>

  <p>Then, noticing that Zheng was in danger, she had immediately come to his rescue without any hesitation. As she widened her eyes in anger, the force of primitive fear quickly condensed in her palm, turning into a long sword.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>The energy on the surface of the long sword was surging frantically. The long sword acted like a tenacious rock located in the center of a river, splitting the turbulent Dark Light Torrents.</p>

  <p>"You want to kill him? That's impossible as long as I'm here!" the woman shouted at Nicholas, standing firmly behind the long sword.</p>

  <p>Nicholas's face darkened slightly. The fatal blow that could have taken Zheng's life had been intercepted by this woman!</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to launch another attack, a powerful Truth of Dark and Light Chaos suddenly appeared below him.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>This time, a wave of Dark Light Torrents spiraled toward him. Of course, it had come from his own clone.</p>

  <p>Nicholas's clone was almost as powerful as Nicholas himself. Since the former had spared no effort to attack him, Nicholas had to go all out to counterattack.</p>

  <p>He had no choice but to unleash the Dark Light Torrents as well.</p>

  <p>While the two Nicholases were fighting against each other, the woman said to Zheng, "Let's go down!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>She took Zheng's hand and they plummeted down.</p>

  <p>As she descended with Zheng, seven of the Holy Beings' clones surrounded and protected them.</p>

  <p>The woman's long black hair fluttered in the wind and gently stroked Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Zheng had always thought of this woman as a violent monster, but he was a little moved by her after she had protected him.</p>

  <p>It seemed that his identity as a descendant of the Nine Li race was really very important to her.</p>

  <p>Everyone at the bottom of the ice volcano was only focusing on two things: avoiding the drifting cold air and killing the Cold Fiends.</p>

  <p>The Cold Fiends had very fragile bodies, but the cold air they emitted was extremely dangerous, making it very difficult to deal with them.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>A sharp sword radiance flashed and cut about eight of the Cold Fiends in half.</p>

  <p>Tianming withdrew his sword and stomped on the volcano wall, dodging three gusts of cold wind that charged toward him.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he saw the mysterious woman and Zheng rushing down from above.</p>

  <p>They were both in a situation that was out of their control. Zheng and Tianming exchanged a glance with each other, and that was the only communication between them.</p>

  <p>In the ongoing chaos, a lot of people died; they turned into ice sculptures and fell on the top of the lair, shattering into pieces.</p>

  <p>"It was indeed my plan to take advantage of them to break into the lair, but I didn't expect so many of them to die. How stupid they are!" the woman commented, sighing with profound resignation.</p>

  <p>According to her original plan, she would have deceived Nicholas and the others into invading the lair first, and then she would have led the cloned Holy Beings inside. But all of a sudden, Nicholas had ushered most of the Cold Fiends upward, throwing everyone into a melee.</p>

  <p>Now, the woman reached out and grabbed at the lair.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A gap that was over a hundred feet long appeared on the lair.</p>

  <p>Then, the woman said, "The Cold Fiends here are continually reborn.</p>

  <p>Anyone who continues to fight here will definitely die. So if you still want to live, come with me."</p>

  <p>Her voice was not loud, but everyone could hear her words clearly.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings, the Demi-holy Beings, and the consummate True Gods all looked down. Just as she had said, numerous Cold Fiends appeared, replacing the dead ones, and flew out of the hexagonal grids.</p>

  <p>"That explains it! I was wondering why we couldn't kill the Cold Fiends when there were only a million of them!"</p>

  <p>"These creatures can be reborn..."</p>

  <p>The fact was, the Holy Beings and the Demi-holy Beings present were so powerful that they could kill thousands or even tens of thousands of Cold Fiends with just one attack.</p>

  <p>But even though they had indeed killed many Cold Fiends, the number of their enemies had never seemed to decrease. Now, it all made sense.</p>

  <p>As soon as the woman finished her words, the clones of the Holy Beings began to use their escape techniques and flew down to her.</p>

  <p>Nicholas's clone also stopped battling Nicholas and moved downward.</p>

  <p>"Let's go inside," the woman said as she pulled Zheng into the crack in the lair.</p>

  <p>The cloned Holy Beings followed closely behind them.</p>

  <p>Of course, Sword Chen would not stay alone here. Seeing that Zheng was being dragged into the lair by the woman, he also followed them inside.</p>

  <p>People from the alliance of the powerful clans still continued to dodge the cold air, but most of them had stopped killing the Cold Fiends. Their eyes were all on Nicholas now.</p>

  <p>Many of them just wanted to leave this damned place!</p>

  <p>Too many people had died here already.</p>

  <p>Many Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings, and consummate True Gods had been killed.</p>

  <p>Now that they had gotten rid of that woman, there was still a chance for them to go back.</p>
