  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment the Reincarnation Plate lifted off the ground, the three Saint Lords appeared above the Auspice City.</p>

  <p>As they looked at the plate, they couldn't help but frown.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Dark World truly had many conjectures— some could speculate that the huge underground palace could be some kind of space tool.</p>

  <p>When seeing such a massive magic treasure, all of them were surprised.</p>

  <p>But the three Saint Lords all belonged to different forces, so they all had different thoughts on their minds.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the Saint Lord of the Demon Night forbade Xun to leave.</p>

  <p>Although she was rather inwardly hesitant, she also knew that there was no other way out— if she let Xun go, she would be implicating the entire Purple Bamboo Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>But before she could even make a move, the eyes of the ogre Saint Lord flashed as he burst out in a cold laughter, "Heavenly Ogre Palm Print!"</p>

  <p>Even though the Saint Lord of a tenth-grade sacred place wasn't considered a world lord, he still had the same extent of cultivation base.</p>

  <p>That in itself made him extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>The instant the Saint Lord attacked, all the vitality between heaven and earth in the sky above the Auspice City began to move in chaos. A massive palm print formed in the sky, no smaller than the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the plate, the palace surrounding Luo Zheng completely disappeared, leaving only himself and the three thousand six hundred divine textures.</p>

  <p>From where he stood, Luo Zheng could see everything that was happening in the outside world. As the giant palm print came into view, a hint of seriousness flashed through his eyes.</p>

  <p>It would have been ideal if he could flee through the Reincarnation Plate— if it were to be broken, he would have no choice but to make use of the token that read 'mountain' to get back to the fairy place. But that was Zheng's last resort— he firmly decided not to do it unless he didn't have any other choice.</p>

  <p>The palm print contained the power of extermination of all living things— it was the strongest attack Luo Zheng had ever seen.</p>

  <p>Even if he had a divine weapon body, that wouldn't have stopped him from disappearing into thin air under the power of the giant palm print.</p>

  <p>Although Livingston was confident in the Reincarnation Plate, Zheng's and Xun's expressions turned grave.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>After an exploding sound, the palm print suddenly covered the Reincarnation Plate, making it rattle and descend several dozen feet.</p>

  <p>Zheng's feet were firmly rooted to the ground. Both his hands moved like shuttles as he controlled the divine textures, doing his best to stabilize the plate's height.</p>

  <p>"Haha! This guy may have the cultivation base of a world lord, but that still doesn't make him qualified to break my Reincarnation Plate!"</p>

  <p>Livingston sneered.</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord's eyes seemed to turn cautious. While the Heavenly Ogre Palm Print also drew out seventy percent of his strength, it still wasn't enough to break down the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the Demon Night seemed to be deep in thought. After releasing a long sigh, she gave a slight wave of her hands and a huge bow, several dozen feet long, appeared. In a flash, she grabbed the bowstring and suddenly retreated.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As she let go of the bowstring, the bow suddenly shot out an invisible arrow at the plate.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Even as the plate was attacked by the invisible arrow, the plate remained as firm as ever, not budging once even as the arrow exploded on it.</p>

  <p>At the sight, the Saint Lord of the Demon Night sighed slightly in relief.</p>

  <p>Although she didn't want to fight against Xun, she had to. But if she still failed to break the Reincarnation Plate with her own strength, Yao couldn't blame her.</p>

  <p>In her heart, she actually hoped for Xun's quick and clever escape.</p>

  <p>The three queens were highly respected by all members of the Demon Night. While Yao had been trying to eradicate Xun's supporters for the past few years, Xun's queen statue was irreplaceable. So long as she wasn't dead, she would still be the queen of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The two Saint Lords had already taken action.</p>

  <p>As for the Saint Lord of the human race, he had no reason to act. Luo Zheng was a member of the alliance, after all, so all he needed to do was to stand by Zheng's side. But much to his disliking, now that Luo Zheng got involved in the internal conflict of the Demon Night, the human Saint Lord wasn't willing to meddle.</p>

  <p>If their involvement was discovered, it could trigger the breaking of the friendly relations between the Demon Night and the alliance. The human race's sacred place in the Dark World would have also needed to be relocated.</p>

  <p>In this case, the human Saint Lord had to consider the human race's interests first before recklessly taking action.</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord wasn't willing to give up. The tougher the plate was, the greater his interest grew. To every sacred place, this sort of space tool was supreme.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Huge palm prints covered the plate, making the whole surface vibrate. In the end, he couldn't do anything to shatter it.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Zheng's face. Never did he think that a Reincarnation Plate would be so strong as to withstand the attacks from a world lord.</p>

  <p>But in the next moment, Zheng's smile disappeared as he saw Freya.</p>

  <p>The ogre Saint Lord ceased his attacks, but Freya, clad in white clothes, floated gracefully in the air, approaching the ogre Saint Lord.</p>

  <p>Numerous green and gray chains twined around Freya's body— she was leaning forward with her hair hanging low as if she had already fallen into a coma.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Luo Zheng, right?"</p>

  <p>A huge roar resounded through the sky in a clap of thunder, spreading into the Reincarnation Plate.</p>

  <p>"I have no interest in your life. That's a matter between you and the Demon Night! Just hand over the Reincarnation Plate and the puppet! I can let you go!" the ogre Saint Lord proclaimed as he used his massive hand to grab hold of Freya. In the hand of the ogre, her petite frame was like a doll's. If he tightened his grip even slightly, she would be crushed to death.</p>

  <p>Witnessing the scene before him, Luo Zheng pulled a long face. If he handed over the Reincarnation Plate, he and Xun would both die. It was impossible for the Demon Night to just let them go.</p>

  <p>Xun's eyes flashed as she frowned— she might not hesitate to sacrifice Freya. In her eyes, the woman was merely a human who had ascended to the Upper World. She was of no significance to her. But Xun had a good grasp of Zheng's character. While Freya might not have been anyone important, Luo Zheng would never sacrifice her. Never would Luo Zheng give up his decision.</p>

  <p>And it was as expected.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng activated one of the divine textures, his voice transmitted from the Reincarnation Plate. "What if I don't hand it over?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this response, the ogre Saint Lord wore a strong smile on his face. Then, two little black snakes slithered out of his sleeves. The slithery creatures extended from his wrists all the way to Freya, coiling around her body.</p>

  <p>Initially, the ogre Saint Lord was afraid that his threat would be useless.</p>

  <p>Because Freya was merely good-looking, not as powerful nor precious as she was made out to be, Luo Zheng probably wasn't willing to hand over the Reincarnation Plate because of her.</p>

  <p>"The consequences of not handing over the Reincarnation Plate is very simple." After the ogre Saint Lord finished those words, the two little snakes coiled around Freya's white neck, spitting out slender, forked tongues. "These Iron Snakes can make this woman suffer terrible torment, enough that she would wish for death."</p>

  <p>Zheng's face turned gloomy as he stared at Freya. After a moment of pondering, he suddenly sneered. Then he said, "I understand, but you seem to be the Saint Lord of a tenth-grade ogre sacred place."</p>

  <p>"So what?" The ogre only snorted.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if this tenth-grade sacred place is important to you. I remember that it should be up north in the Dark World. But I don't know if you'd be sad if I destroyed this tenth-grade ogre sacred place!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" Hearing this, the ogre Saint Lord got furious.</p>

  <p>But with a wave of his hand, over a hundred divine textures were activated. The entire Reincarnation Plate slowly spun before shooting to the north.</p>

  <p>The Reincarnation Plate was a space tool used by the Supreme Lord, with an extremely fast speed of travel. Relying on the plate, Luo Zheng managed to block the attacks of the Saint Lords. But he couldn't make his counterattack. The three thousand six hundred divine textures didn't have such an ability.</p>

  <p>Just by relying on the enormous size of the plate and its unshakeable outer shell, it was enough to set a rampage within the ogre sacred place.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>In a flash, the ogre Saint Lord caught up from behind and once again placed his palm on the Reincarnation Plate, intending to stop Luo Zheng.</p>
