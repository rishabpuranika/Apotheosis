  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing his daughter leave in a rush, War King Wind was rather shocked, and it showed on his face.</p>

  <p>Even as a king of the Divine Kingdom Continent and a top-notch warrior in the Lower World, he was nothing in front of the Spirit Supreme Realm masters.</p>

  <p>These seven masters had been acting a little crazily from start to end. He was afraid that his daughter's behavior might irritate them somehow.</p>

  <p>While War King Wind wanted to stop her, his daughter shot out like an arrow? he couldn't stop her in time.</p>

  <p>Caring about Fiona the most, War King Wind understood her personality rather well. He had already figured out long ago that his daughter took a fancy to Luo Luo Zheng. She had always been so gentle and restrained? War King Wind hadn't exactly expected her to be so impulsive when it came to such matters.</p>

  <p>Rushing out, Fiona stepped in front of Luo Luo Zheng and stared at him with her most charming eyes. There was no smile on her face and her expression turned utterly serious.</p>

  <p>"Will you really come back?" Fiona bit her lips and softly asked.</p>

  <p>Seeing her expression, Luo Luo Zheng faintly smiled and nodded cautiously, "Of course I'll be back."</p>

  <p>Though she seemed ready to speak, it was an impulse, just now. At this moment, she realized that everyone was looking at her? it made her blush. But this hesitation could only afford to last a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, it was difficult for a young girl to do certain things. But no matter what, she immediately made up her mind? she took the necklace from her neck, walked up to Luo Luo Zheng and put the necklace on him.</p>

  <p>While it wasn't a precious thing, it was still her token.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait for your return!" Fiona said. She had to put on the best-forced smile she could before turning around and leaving.</p>

  <p>Wearing the necklace, Luo Luo Zheng watched Fiona's back with a complicated expression. Silently, he nodded and then got on the Eight-diagram Wheel. As for Woody and the big man, they both had faint smiles on their faces? both of which Luo Luo Zheng chose to ignore.</p>

  <p>In addition to Luo Luo Zheng and the other seven members of the Celestial Position, Brianna was brought into the wheel.</p>

  <p>As the Eight-diagram Wheel slowly rotated, the warriors inside flew into the space hole. Not long after, the Eight-diagram Wheel disappeared from the members of the divine kingdoms. After Delroy removed the enchanted barrier of the space crack, it diminished rapidly. The crack was considered as something like the 'wound' of the great world.</p>

  <p>Originally, the world had the ability to self-heal? such a wound was a minor thing. But the warriors who mastered the Space Law could see the shadow? the weakest part of the space.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the four divine kingdoms' warriors, the Celestial Position members were like the plague? they brought upon fear and doom. As soon as they disappeared, many Soul Sea Realm masters felt the burden lift off their shoulders as relief replaced their anxiety.</p>

  <p>Only Derek still pulled a long face.</p>

  <p>"Master Derek," Marine called him. "Do you still want to report on Luo Zheng's information?"</p>

  <p>"Humph! Of course! This news must be reported! Today, the Reverse Spirit Channel will be opened! How could the Celestial Position race meddle in our matters?" At this point, Derek was shouting in fury.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, he had to search for either Luo Luo Zheng or the Ancestral Dragon himself. If the Celestial Position wanted to have a hand in it, they had to first prove if they had the ability to do so.</p>

  <p>The several rulers of the four divine kingdoms merely ignored Derek's anger. It was all thanks to Luo Luo Zheng that they were even alive. After getting everything ready, they set on their own journey as well, leaving the Feather Holy Sea. They had to leave this place before the blood sacrifice power fully recovered...</p>

  <p>In the darkness, the Eight-diagram Wheel was moving at rapid speed.</p>

  <p>There was no light in the space crack? behind it was only the void.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng determined the proper direction, Hank steered the Eight-diagram Wheel, moving forward at an increasing speed. This time, they passed through the Chaotic Ocean of Stars and traveled to the backside of the world, avoiding the threat of the deadly storm.</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Luo Zheng and Logan fought in the void, but only for a short period.</p>

  <p>This time, it was a far longer journey in the void.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's curiosity was piqued in the pitch-black darkness? it was as though nothing existed around him. Sitting on the Eight-diagram Wheel, he glanced around in thought and then asked, "Does nothing exist in the void?"</p>

  <p>The seven members of the Celestial race sat cross-legged on the Eight-diagram Wheel, their heads held high. Upon hearing Luo Zheng's question, Woody responded in a voice dripping with sarcasm, "Of course, it's called the void because nothing exists in here. What a foolish question!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng only rolled his eyes at the retort. Apart from Max and Dorothea, none of the rest seemed friendly. Many were very arrogant and some often liked to offer unkind jabs just as Woody did. With that, Luo Luo Zheng decided to stop talking and sat cross-legged to meditate, closing his eyes off to the world.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Luo Luo Zheng felt a sudden wave of cold breath rush past him.</p>

  <p>The other seven opened their eyes as well at the sensation. Suddenly, Max stood up with a deep frown on his face.</p>

  <p>Everyone else seemed to have felt the coldness. "What's that?" Dorothea asked with her brows furrowed.</p>

  <p>In his worry, Max's face turned grim.</p>

  <p>"We're unlucky this time around. It seems that we will encounter the Shadow Creature!" "What on earth is a Shadow Creature?" Woody asked, his voice a bit raised from frustration.</p>

  <p>"The Shadow Creature is the living being on the back side of the world,"</p>

  <p>Delroy responded. "I should also correct you from earlier? something indeed exists in the void. Although there aren't many Shadow Creatures in here, all of them are very strong. We'll be in great trouble if we ever have to face them."</p>

  <p>"Why is there such a thing..." At this point, Woody began feeling rather embarrassed. When the Shadow Creature appeared right after he retorted Luo Luo Zheng, it put him in an awkward situation.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng merely rolled his eyes, finding the whole thing very trivial? he had never liked arguing with idiots like Woody.</p>

  <p>Huff, huff, huff?</p>

  <p>In the darkness, not even the Spirit Supreme Realm masters could see from a long distance. Still in the flying Eight-diagram Wheel, they surely had no idea what happened. The sound alarmed everyone, turning the atmosphere anxious.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed and a wisp of jade-green luster shone in his eyes.</p>

  <p>After he activated his magic vision ability, the darkness in the void slowly disappeared? it was instead replaced by a green, healthy world.</p>

  <p>After surveying the area for a moment, his gaze fell on something behind him. His eyes widened in shock as he shouted, "What is that?"</p>

  <p>A giant head, tens of thousands of feet away from the Eight-diagram Wheel, rapidly followed behind them.</p>

  <p>The head looked like that of a human being, but it was as large as a mountain. Instead of hair on its head, there sat numerous thick pythons.</p>

  <p>Unlike the others, Luo Luo Zheng could make use of his magic vision to observe the giant head from a distance.</p>

  <p>"What do you see?" Max asked nervously. It was no easy task for them to deal with the Shadow Creature, after all. And while Max was curious about how Luo Luo Zheng saw the creature, he didn't dare question him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could see the head approaching them. "A head? a huge head!"</p>

  <p>"A head?"</p>

  <p>After a moment of pondering, the fear sank in as Max's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>"This is terrible? How could such a thing exist in the shadow of the great world?"</p>

  <p>Delroy looked devastated as he spoke in a trembling voice, "Oh no?</p>

  <p>Leave this void right now!"</p>

  <p>"Leave the void? But the outside area is the sky above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars! This Star Storm is also..." Luo Luo Zheng began uttering.</p>

  <p>But Max merely snorted at his reaction. "Compared to that creature, the Star Storm is nothing at all! Delroy, get ready!" With that, Max swung his cane in front of him once again. It was obvious that this time, Max had made complete use of his power, charged through his cane.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>With such great power, the cracking sounds of the space began blending? it was extremely ear-piercing, as if tens of thousands of people were scraping their nails against a screeching surface.</p>
