<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng put away the soul pills and was just about to leave when one of the Ear Mice politely called out, "Sir, please wait a minute."</p>

  <p>Zheng stopped and turned around. His gaze landed at the Ear Mouse and he asked, "Yeah, what's up?"</p>

  <p>"It's nothing really. But I was wondering if you could tell me something.</p>

  <p>What is the relationship between you and that physical body on the Other Shore?" the Ear Mouse asked.</p>

  <p>After a thorough investigation of the matter, the Ear Mice seemed much more polite now.</p>

  <p>The change in their attitude made Zheng realize that they already knew something about his secret. The only thing was, he had never expected that they would ask him about it directly.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he smiled gently and told them, "I am his spokesperson."</p>

  <p>An interesting property of the Other Shore was that nobody could identify anyone with their blurred appearance. This might also be considered an advantage. As long as Zheng did not admit it personally, it was almost impossible for others to be sure that he was exactly the person appearing on the Other Shore in physical form.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had invaded the Bearing race's temple, Dorothy had also been present with him.</p>

  <p>Because of that, the Bearing race knew that the temple-destroyer had some connections with the Oneness Sky Palace. However, since the Oneness Sky Palace insisted that the Bearing race were wrong and they had nothing to do with the invasion, there was no way to know. There was no way for the Bearing race to confirm their suspicions.</p>

  <p>After leaving the room, Zheng circled around the low building.</p>

  <p>Dorothy and Jermain were waiting for him at the gate.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's coming!" Dorothy saw Zheng coming from the distance; she waved at him and said, "Come on. The auction has already begun. Let's hurry up!"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and the three of them entered the auction house together.</p>

  <p>Coming there felt like coming to a different place altogether.</p>

  <p>Compared to the low-lying building behind them, the auction house was built lavishly and reeked of wealth.</p>

  <p>Most of the other super forces would only build a small stronghold at Stage Thirteen. In comparison, the Ear Mouse race possessed a large area of land, and that was apparent.</p>

  <p>The wide hall had efficient seating arrangements, which had been well thought out, keeping guests of different sizes in consideration. After all, their guests were from various races and would be of various sizes. Some chairs were a few inches tall and some were several feet long.</p>

  <p>When they entered the hall, the auction had already been going on for some time.</p>

  <p>Inside, an Ear Mouse was zealously introducing a fourth-grade Other Shore Token. It was standing right at the center, and explaining how the token had been obtained from Stage Nine. The base price was set at two hundred thousand soul pills.</p>

  <p>But Zheng himself had just sold a large number of fourth-grade Other Shore Tokens to the Ear Mice. Therefore, he had no interest in the item on display at the moment.</p>

  <p>However, there were quite a few people from various races bidding for the item. A single Other Shore Token might not be of any use to them, but after they had accumulated a large enough amount, they could send them back to their temples at Stage Four.</p>

  <p>After several fierce rounds of bidding, the Other Shore Token was finally sold and the next item was brought in.</p>

  <p>Following this sale, the Ear Mouse put several more fourth-grade Other Shore Tokens up for auction. Zheng and Dorothy kept on watching quietly without any intentions of participating in bidding.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Jermain won a bid for an Other Shore Token from Stage Eleven. But it was obvious that he had not bought the item for his own use.</p>

  <p>After a dozen fourth-grade tokens had been sold in a row, the Ear Mouse finally brought out a fifth-grade Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>Now this was something valuable. Even Jermain showed high interest in this item. However, it had a very high base price. Ten million soul pills was not something that Jermain could afford, therefore, he had to let go of the idea.</p>

  <p>"Jermain, the Ear Mice have put up several fourth-grade and fifth-grade tokens for auction. I want to know if there will be any sixth-grade tokens too," Zheng remarked.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know the ranks of the two Other Shore Tokens he had.</p>

  <p>He had two Eyes of Will with him. He had originally considered selling the spare one, but now that he didn't lack soul pills, he decided not to do so.</p>

  <p>The Eyes of Will were very rare items. Legend had it that only nineteen of those existed in the Dreaded Eye Demon race. The value of an Eye of Will therefore, was quite evident, but their rank still remained unknown to Zheng.</p>

  <p>His Strength God Totem had been obtained from the Oneness Sky Palace's temple. Zheng believed that the Oneness Sky Palace was not inferior to the Bearing race. This meant that they had comparable treasure hordes, which also meant that the Strength God Totem was probably a fourth-grade token.</p>

  <p>"Sixth-grade token, you say?"</p>

  <p>At the mention of this, Jermain smiled wryly and said, "Very few such tokens were ever discovered in the Lust World. Therefore, it is almost impossible that such a powerful and precious token would be put up for auction. Even if someone wants to sell one, it would be impossible to complete the deal with just soul pills. Sixth-grade tokens are usually exchanged for soul crystal."</p>

  <p>Sixth-grade Other Shore Tokens were priceless, and so was the soul crystal.</p>

  <p>It was reasonable therefore, that people would exchange one of them for another.</p>

  <p>"Ah well. Looks like I am going to have to leave this auction empty-handed. I don't see anything of interest," Zheng said, heaving a sigh.</p>

  <p>"Oh? So you didn't bid for anything because you had no interest in any of the items at all?" Jermain asked, somehow astonished. Now this was an interesting turn of events.</p>

  <p>Jermain didn't know Zheng's other identities. The only thing he knew was that Zheng was an excellent disciple of the Flow Sword Sect. Therefore, he had no idea about his wealth or lack thereof. Hence, he thought that Zheng did not participate in the auction because he didn't have many soul pills.</p>

  <p>Dorothy chuckled, sitting on the other side. She knew that if Zheng revealed even a fraction of his whole wealth, he would shock Jermain to the core.</p>

  <p>To be frank, if Zheng really did put up all of his assets on display, Dorothy herself would be equally shocked. After all, the treasures and the wealth Zheng had obtained from the Nine Li race were huge, both in quality and quantity.</p>

  <p>"It's not that I completely lack interest in them. But I just did not find anything suitable enough for me," Zheng replied modestly.</p>

  <p>However, as the auction progressed, Zheng did eventually participate and buy several Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>These Other Shore Tokens were of no use to him. However, once Nelly, Xun, and Liusu reached the Other Shore Realm, they were going to need these tokens. Midway through the auction, he had come up with the idea of buying a few things for them.</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen, all Other Shore Tokens have been sold now. The last item for today's auction is: the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple!" the Ear Mouse suddenly announced in a louder, excited, and much more grandeur voice.</p>

  <p>Zheng instantly felt a sudden rise in the interest the bidders were showing in the auction when the Ear Mouse mentioned the Grand Sky Temple. It was obvious that they valued this Other Shore Key very much.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Sky Temple... Hey isn't that the temple that Tyquan once explored in the past?" Dorothy suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>The explorer Dorothy was referring to was named Tyquan Yuan, an excellent and talented person from the Origin Mountain. He had now surpassed the Lust World and entered the Desire World. Today, he was a legend and was considered one of the best warriors in the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>However, the time he was referring to was a long while back. In those days, Tyquan had obtained a sixth-grade Other Shore Token from the Grand Sky Temple. It was from Stage Thirteen and therefore, had guaranteed him powerful strength even in the Desire World.</p>

  <p>"Yes! You are right," Jermain replied, equally surprised. "I never expected that the Ear Mice would put the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple up for auction. This might be the grand finale for the auction!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the Ear Mouse had finished the introduction, it announced a base price of five million soul pills. The audience were stunned into silence when Dorothy quickly raised her hand and made the first bid, "Eight million soul pills!"</p>

  <p>Zheng and Jermain both looked at Dorothy, taken aback by her bold bidding.</p>

  <p>Jermain audibly gasped. No matter how much interest she had in the Other Shore Key, they thought that such a high bid was a rather impulsive decision.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy..."</p>

  <p>Jermain tried to remind Dorothy that she shouldn't be so generous, or more accurately, reckless with her wealth.</p>

  <p>However, his fears were allayed. "Don't worry. I was bidding on his behalf,"</p>

  <p>Dorothy said with a chuckle. "He will be the one paying for it anyway!"</p>

  <p>"Hey! Really! That's a great favor!"</p>

  <p>Zheng sighed in resignation. It was true that he wanted to bid for this Other Shore Key, but such a high bid was obviously unwise. In any case, their discussion was put on hold when, "Sixteen million soul pills."</p>

  <p>Another voice rang out in the hall, doubling Dorothy's bid immediately.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Jermain were stunned into silence. They had witnessed all sorts of auctions, and had seen quite a few where fast and even ultra-fast bidding would take place, but they had never seen someone crazy enough to totally double the price, especially when it was already so high. Who was this guy?</p>
