  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was able to decode almost every Sanskrit word he met in the past.</p>

  <p>But today, even if he had decoded these two words, he still wasn't able to understand the meanings of them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought for a while and asked, "Read those words to me. I'll try to remember them."</p>

  <p>"Okay." Luo Nian proceeded to read the words written on the copper sheets.</p>

  <p>But as Luo Nian spoke every word, all Luo Zheng heard were a bunch of strange syllables that sounded bizarre. Just hearing them made Luo Zheng want to laugh out loud.</p>

  <p>Despite the humor and the strange words, Luo Zheng still managed to memorize them completely.</p>

  <p>"Okay, that's it. I'm done." Luo Nian shrugged. It wasn't only Luo Zheng who thought that the words were quite odd, for Luo Nian felt the same way. "Can I go back now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you can!" Luo Zheng gave his son's head a soft pat and smiled. "I see that you have a good taste in women. If you really want to marry the woman you like, then you have to tell me first!"</p>

  <p>"Got it. But I don't have time for that now. I'm busy." Luo Nian pursed his lips and his figure flashed, disappearing in front of his father as he used the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng stood there with two Other Shore Keys in his hands as he tried to figure out what the Sanskrit words meant.</p>

  <p>"What the Ear Mouse gave me is an Other Shore Key of Stage One. It means..." Luo Zheng muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Key of Stage Nineteen might be much more valuable than the one that he got from the Ear Mouse. Given this, he thought, 'That Ear Mouse from the Mice League is indeed cunning!'</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had to endure climbing up one step at a time. Once he stepped on the Other Shore, the Other Shore Key of Stage One would certainly be the most suitable for him.</p>

  <p>Little did Luo Zheng know that there was a huge gap in the value of the two different Other Shore Keys.</p>

  <p>In fact, the value of the Other Shore Key that he had acquired from the tomb would dramatically increase to over a hundred million divine crystals once the Sanskrit word written on it was decoded. On the other hand, the one that he got from the Ear Mouse was deemed much less valuable.</p>

  <p>After giving it some thought, Luo Zheng flew away and disappeared.</p>

  <p>But before he had gone, he laid his eyes on his son who had just used his spear to defeat one of the Heavenly Annihilation Demons.</p>

  <p>"This guy..."</p>

  <p>The apple didn't fall too far from the tree. His son was strong-willed and talented just like himself. In fact, his son was more willful than Luo Zheng was when he was Luo Nian's age.</p>

  <p>But at some point, there was no fair comparison between them. In Luo Zheng's case, he grew up in his father's inner world and he did not know much about the outside world. As for Luo Nian, he also lived in his father's world but had an adequate understanding of both worlds. As a result, he became fearless. In his heart, he believed that no matter how stubborn he was, someone would come to his aid and support him when he needed one.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, after learning the secret of the two cooper sheets, Luo Zheng immediately left his inner world.</p>

  <p>A day after, he went to the Sea of Truth to help Evaristus break the huge whirlpool and by doing this, he also got the third candle.</p>

  <p>Evaristus had been stuck in the Sea of Truth for so many years. After being rescued, he did not have enough motivation to move forward. Despite this, Luo Zheng and Dorothy still wanted to move onward. After they had successfully crossed the sixth line, they soon began heading on to the seventh line.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had produced numerous bottles of Sword-reading Liquid and sold them. After days of selling the merchandise, he and his men noticed that the volume of the sales slowly calmed down. But in fact, they could still earn about one million divine crystals on a single day! Even if the price was only fifteen thousand divine crystals a bottle, only a few people could be able to afford it.</p>

  <p>After Gant obtained some divine crystals, he entered the Dragon City much often than he used to. As he had said, he could still enter the city without being a Flag Master.</p>

  <p>After three months, Luo Zheng's Soul of Light got better and stronger.</p>

  <p>For a period of time, he stayed in the Sea of Truth day in and day out, no matter the cost. During that time, he neither moved forward, nor stepped back. In the Sea of Truth, he just quietly endured the chill of the sea water in order to strengthen his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>At that moment, his Soul of Light was not much stronger than that of the others. He wasn't able to do much but cultivate. Fortunately, the water's chill was enough to constantly help him in strengthening his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>During the past three months, he had accomplished crossing the seventh and eighth lines together with Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Crossing the eighth line meant that he had almost reached the end of the Sea of Truth. There, he placed his gaze on the blue sea water and saw small crystals that floated in it. These crystals might seem pretty, but they were ruthless enough to erode the Truth Boats that they were in. Despite this strong obstacle, he remained calm as he knew that this was a test for his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng crossed the ninth line, he would finally be on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, from a distance, he faintly saw a vague shadow on the Other Shore. Not being able to clearly see what it was, he became determined to rush over as fast as he could to investigate.</p>
