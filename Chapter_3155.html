<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned at Dorothy's words. What was so important?</p>

  <p>But he figured it out soon enough. "You mean the Other Shore Token?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Dorothy replied.</p>

  <p>"Does the palace distribute Other Shore Tokens?" Zheng asked again. He had once thought that all the Other Shore Tokens could only be obtained by people through their own strength.</p>

  <p>"It's a good thing for us to obtain a few rare Other Shore Tokens by ourselves in temples. The palace will, however, also help its disciples get some," said Dorothy.</p>

  <p>Some large sects would distribute things like magic weapons to their disciples. But such free weapons were quite ordinary.</p>

  <p>Her words brought Zheng's expectations down. The Other Shore Tokens allocated to disciples in the palace were probably not that strong, after all.</p>

  <p>Dorothy guessed what he was thinking and added, "These Other Shore Tokens were collected from different places by strong warriors in the palace. Some of them are from Stage Four and some from even higher stages. But whether you can hold them depends on your own ability."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Zheng's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>They continued chatting till they reached the temple's inner area.</p>

  <p>More than thirty people were waiting in front of a wide door that had been tightly shut. These Souls of Light were sitting on the ground, silently indicating that they had been waiting for a long time.</p>

  <p>Dorothy walked up to them and asked, "When will the Seclusion Door open?"</p>

  <p>One of them opened his eyes and answered, "It should be today."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." Dorothy stepped back with Zheng and waited by the wall.</p>

  <p>Most disciples of the palace didn't explore temples after they entered the Other Shore. They were so dangerous, they could die if they weren't careful enough. What was more, the hard earned Other Shore Tokens were probably inferior to those allocated by the palace.</p>

  <p>Laser focused on cultivation to strengthen their Souls of Light, these disciples would then quickly enter the Mysterious Root Stage to get Other Shore Tokens here.</p>

  <p>But these palace disciples were from the Oneness Mountain or Oneness Guards.</p>

  <p>People from Dragon City weren't so lucky. They only had two ways out: to go up the mountain or join the Oneness Guards.</p>

  <p>As they waited, more and more Souls of Light gathered around the Seclusion Door. At last count, the number was almost eight hundred!</p>

  <p>"The Flow Sword Sect has a small population. How is it that so many people have come to get the Other Shore Tokens?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"The palace doesn't have just the Oneness Mountain. Besides, the Flow Sword Sect is much smaller than the other two sword sects," Dorothy replied.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that the Flow Sword Sect was one of the three major sects of the Oneness Mountain, it was still suitable for few people. So most disciples still ended up choosing the Killing Sword Sect or the Unique Array Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>More than an hour later, the Seclusion Door shook gently.</p>

  <p>"Boom..." With a cracking boom, the door crashed open.</p>

  <p>Everyone stood up and a frantic rush to enter ensued.</p>

  <p>The space within the door was wide. There were two huge copper rings at the center and it felt like something was hidden underground.</p>

  <p>Three Souls of Light walked out of another door.</p>

  <p>'Their Souls of Light are so powerful!' Zheng thought, with his eyes narrowing at them.</p>

  <p>Ever since he had entered the temple, Zheng had seen the Souls of Light of many disciples. They emitted a scent that was almost inferior to his and Dorothy's Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>But these three men's Souls of Light were on a much higher level.</p>

  <p>Most Souls of Light were grayish brown. Although their faces were blurred, their outline and clothes could be seen rather vaguely. But these three men had Souls of Light that emitted a pale purple light.</p>

  <p>Two of them walked quickly up to the copper rings, transforming their arms into thin, soft ropes and wrapped them around the rings.</p>

  <p>They pulled open the lid on the ground, revealing a deep pit.</p>

  <p>The man at the front clapped his hands.</p>

  <p>A huge bronze column rose from within this bottomless pit.</p>

  <p>A huge plate was embedded in the pillar, with several circles embossed on it, like ripples in water.</p>

  <p>"Thirteen circles in total?" Zheng asked, counting them.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Dorothy nodded. "Each circle represents one stage of the Other Shore. Thirteen stages in total."</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised. "Thirteen stages?! Does it mean that the plate has Other Shore Tokens up to the thirteenth stage?"</p>

  <p>The other disciples waiting beside them turned to look at Zheng rather sneeringly. "Nothing new!" one of them said, smirking.</p>

  <p>"Only if you have the ability to merge them! Without the Ten Sanskrit Land, you can do nothing to these excellent Other Shore Tokens!"</p>

  <p>"For you, stones from Stage Thirteen are no different from those at Stage One!".</p>

  <p>They were both right and wrong.</p>

  <p>For example, the Eye of Will that Zheng had merged was far stronger than the Other Shore Tokens from Stage One. Or it could be said that the Eye of Will was not an Other Shore Token from Stage One.</p>

  <p>In a whole, the Other Shore Tokens from higher stages were more powerful.</p>

  <p>Dorothy explained patiently to Zheng, "The Other Shore is divided into three worlds. The first world is called Lust World and it contains thirteen stages.</p>

  <p>If one surmounts these thirteen stages, they will reach the Desire World.</p>

  <p>They can't return to the Lust World from there. So the highest level of the Other Shore Tokens that you can collect here is Stage Thirteen."</p>

  <p>"I see," Zheng said, nodding in comprehension. He really knew very little about the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>One of the three Souls of Light waved his hand and the concealed cases beneath the outermost ring of the plate began to roll up, taking the Other Shore Tokens on the plate along with them.</p>

  <p>These Other Shore Tokens were strange. Some were like a ram's horns, some like delicious fruits, and some like messy hair.</p>

  <p>But the Other Shore Tokens in the outermost circle were from Stage One, which was why they didn't contain strong Other Shore Power. Zheng guessed they had about two or three divine megatons of force and that the strongest one contained no more than five divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>"Why do they need Other Shore Tokens from Stage One now that they have reached the fourth stage of the Other Shore Realm?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"Because the strength of an Other Shore Token doesn't solely depend on how much Other Shore Power it contains," Dorothy said, shrugging. "Some special Other Shore Tokens with unique abilities often have unexpected effects. You've practiced a few Truths of Godly Ways. You need to be careful while choosing the Other Shore Tokens."</p>

  <p>The concealed cases in the circles were still being rolled up. Other Shore Tokens in the second, third, and fourth circles were all revealed.</p>
