  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although the members of the Oneness Sky Palace were transported efficiently and swiftly, it was still a mammoth project.</p>

  <p>In fact, when the seven huge flying ships flew west, there were informants constantly cascading the information to the Black Ship and the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>The Bearing race and the Black Ship had received instructions from the Element Spirit race and the Nihility race respectively. Their goal was clear, and they intended to gain control over Zheng at any cost.</p>

  <p>At the same time, in the Grand Plain Stage, Pearce also appealed to the Pear Hill for help.</p>

  <p>In fact, as the Oneness Sky Palace members arrived at the Prime North Province, the three forces, including the Pear Hill, the Bearing race, and the Black Ship, had all appeared, and they were intrigued by the discovery of each other's existence.</p>

  <p>However, for the time being, the Pear Hill was not in a hurry, while Yellow Thearch and the captain of the Black Ship were both growing anxious.</p>

  <p>Of course, they didn't intend for the flying ships of the Oneness Sky Palace to enter the safety of the Pear Hill's territory. However, Yellow Thearch and the captain were both shrewd warriors, and neither of them were willing to make the initial move.</p>

  <p>Everyone wanted to win out and reach the top, but they didn't want to take any action to do so.</p>

  <p>The captain was a man of calm demeanor. He trailed behind the flying ships, slowly following through the skies with the fleet of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>However, the members of the Bearing race were the first to no longer be able to contain their anxiety.</p>

  <p>Yellow Thearch didn't want to make the first move, so he released Usman to intercept them in the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>As for Yellow Thearch, Divine Farmer, and Mahoney, they were on standby in their flying ships.</p>

  <p>If Usman kept launching successful attacks and killing many warriors like this, it would be the turn of the Pear Hill to get anxiety.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the captain was fairly confident that Fuxi would take action before him.</p>

  <p>"Shera, what is on your mind?" asked the captain.</p>

  <p>Shera was sitting by the railing of the ship, and her pair of smooth, white and long legs were hanging in the air. The black hemline of her dress fluttered in the breeze, and there was a tired look in her eyes.</p>

  <p>She kept a watchful eye on Usman, noting the blades moving from all directions and forming disorderly lines.</p>

  <p>"Are you still infatuated with Usman?" the "bamboo pole" wrapped with bandage asked. Everyone was aware at that time that Shera had a crush on Usman.</p>

  <p>Shera shrugged and said indifferently, "This Usman is merely an incarnation of resentment. He is someone else."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe that," the captain said, shaking his head. "In fact, he is still the same Usman, but he just lacks all memories of his past."</p>

  <p>Shera glanced at the captain.</p>

  <p>Since the captain had raised this matter on purpose, he clearly wanted to make a point and say something more.</p>

  <p>He added unhurriedly, "As the incarnation of resentment, Usman is bound to be out of control. In fact, what Yellow Thearch has done is merely a repetition of what we have done in the past."</p>

  <p>"Sooner or later, they will face a counterattack from Usman," Shera said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Maybe they will not suffer a counterattack," the captain countered, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Shera asked in a confused tone.</p>

  <p>"The Grandmaster of Heaven has instructed us that the goal for now is not only to capture Zheng, but also to devour Usman," the captain replied.</p>

  <p>"Devour Usman? Who will be responsible for that?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this news, the members of the Black Ship were confused.</p>

  <p>"That Evil God," the captain explained indifferently.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God? Isn't that warrior still on the Other Shore?" the brass man asked in a hollow and metallic voice.</p>

  <p>"We can help him descend," said the captain.</p>

  <p>"Bring that brat back here? Isn't it too..."</p>

  <p>To force something or someone to descend from the Other Shore would require the consumption of a golden red Chaotic Source Spirit. Every golden red Chaotic Source Spirit was priceless and far too precious to waste.</p>

  <p>Since so many powerful members of the Nihility race needed to descend, the chance of the Evil God coming down was slim. After all, he hadn't even stepped into the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>"If he can really merge with Usman, it is a sacrifice worth making," the captain said calmly.</p>

  <p>"But by nature, he is no different from Usman. He is only useful while he is weak. Once he gains strength, I'm afraid we won't be able to control him at all," Shera said, her eyes gleaming with concern.</p>

  <p>The captain shrugged his shoulders and said, "Who knows what the Grandmaster of Heaven is planning? We must do as he said..." At this point, the captain seemed to notice something and added with a smile, "Fuxi can't stand it anymore."</p>

  <p>The destructive power of Usman was too potent.</p>

  <p>The thin cracks had been formed by the invisible blade along the ground, and these were spreading out, almost slicing the entire Separate Amber Province into countless puzzle pieces.</p>

  <p>The Holy Soul Realm warriors and even the Chaotic Source Realm warriors were strong enough to dodge.</p>

  <p>But given the situation, the seven ships of the Oneness Sky Palace were loaded with many disciples. Scores of them were sliced into two pieces without even knowing what had happened.</p>

  <p>Although most of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace had scattered in all directions, the invisible blade pierced through the entire Separate Amber Province, and in the end, they could not avoid it. If they were not watchful and alert, they would lose their arms and legs, or even be severed in half.</p>

  <p>As a member of the human race, Fuxi couldn't tolerate this continued slaughter.</p>

  <p>While Usman was engaged in the wanton slaughter of the people, a huge mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on the boundary wall, and on the chest of Usman, another mark of Eight Diagrams materialized.</p>

  <p>When Usman saw the mark of Eight Diagrams on his chest, he was briefly stunned.</p>

  <p>Then he felt a terrifying wave rolling up from behind him, and a large hole instantly appeared in the solid boundary wall.</p>

  <p>The terrifying wave did not stop after it pierced through the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>Instead, it directly slammed into his chest.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>It was a power that Usman had previously not experienced.</p>

  <p>He felt his chest explode from the impact, and the irresistible force slammed him to the ground with a tremendous force.</p>

  <p>The wave of impact collapsed the ground, and the power that slammed him down even left a huge crater in the ground.</p>

  <p>Even though the crater was already thousands of feet deep, the remaining power still continued to press him down. The black soil buried him past his head, and he didn't know how deep he had sunk.</p>

  <p>However, before the power could dissipate, another massive force lifted him up.</p>

  <p>When Usman was raised out of the thick soil, he saw a man with black hair standing in front of him. This man's unique temperament and aura left Usman feeling a little uneasy.</p>

  <p>From the moment of his birth, Usman had never feared anyone. It could even be said that he had no knowledge of what fear was.</p>

  <p>Even in the face of Yellow Thearch, he remained unafraid.</p>

  <p>However, this black haired man before him filled him with trepidation.</p>

  <p>"Did you think no one can defeat you?" Fuxi glared balefully at Usman.</p>

  <p>"Just you..."</p>

  <p>However, as Usman was about to speak, a mark of Eight Diagrams appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Even an Eternal Realm warrior would have faced death if this punch had landed on their face.</p>

  <p>However, since Usman was formed by the resentment of the Source World, he had been integrated into the world.</p>

  <p>Although he was still quite weak, he could easily control a province!</p>

  <p>The power of the blow had completely been transferred to the boundary wall by him...</p>

  <p>"Boom!" "Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>In the distance, another large hole appeared in the boundary wall, accompanied by a web of cracks. This was the damage inflicted by Fuxi's punch.</p>

  <p>"Can you keep transferring the power infinitely?" Fuxi asked.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Usman snorted in derision.</p>

  <p>"When I completely smash the boundary wall of the Separate Amber Province, I'll see if you can still grin and hold on then," Fuxi threatened, clenching his fists again.</p>

  <p>At the same time, many Eight Diagrams patterns appeared all over Usman's body, covering his face, chest, legs, abdomen...</p>

  <p>"What are you planning to do?" There was a hint of fear glimmering in Usman's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Beat you!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Fuxi had spoken, his fists began swinging towards Usman, instantly creating countless fist shadows, all of which landed on Usman's body.</p>
