<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now that he had fallen into such a predicament, Master Evil no longer thought of the Stone Mouse and was only focused on helping Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After instructing the young man to put away the mouse's corpse, he then led him away and guided him through the narrow cave. When they finally got out, Luo Luo Zheng found himself by a mountain stream a hundred miles away from the Misty Mountain Village.</p>

  <p>The path they had taken originally connected to the hollow area below the village. In the past, Master Evil had used a special method to dig countless branch paths, forming an inescapable underground maze.</p>

  <p>A few villagers had mistakenly entered the cave and inevitably got trapped in the maze. This was confirmed by Luo Luo Zheng when he saw several sets of bones that most probably belonged to the villagers who had unfortunately lost their way.</p>

  <p>After crossing the mountain stream, Luo Luo Zheng managed to return to the Misty Mountain Village where the Sun Moon Village's chief and warriors remained waiting in silence.</p>

  <p>They knew something was wrong when they saw the state of the Misty Mountain Village. None of the Sun Moon Village warriors dared to step into the bottomless pit in front of them.</p>

  <p>However, none of them also dared to leave without seeing Master Evil first so they could only stand in wait.</p>

  <p>It was only half a day later that they finally saw Luo Luo Zheng walk towards them.</p>

  <p>"You... Sir, where have you been? Did you see Master Evil?" the Sun Moon Village chief asked.</p>

  <p>With Master Evil's return, the possibility of reviving the seventy-two villages was now at hand. If that happened then the Sun Moon Village chief would definitely be recognized. Of course he would be worried about Master Evil's condition.</p>

  <p>"Master Evil?" Luo Luo Zheng scratched his head. "I almost fell to my death and walked out of the cave in a daze. I'm not really sure where he is now either..."</p>

  <p>"You're not sure?" The Sun Moon Village chief and his warriors could only look at each other in dismay. The glaring confusion on Luo Zheng's face meant he was obviously not pretending so it was no use questioning him anymore. All they could do now was to go down into the pit and find their master themselves.</p>

  <p id="top_15">A sigh came to Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Master Evil had returned to the Vast Sky Region in order to revive the seventy-two villages. He couldn't bear seeing the Sun Moon Village reduced to the state it was in now. Unfortunately, he had lost all power and ability to ever set out what he intended to do. He could only let Luo Luo Zheng deal with them and let them fend for themselves.</p>

  <p>The villagers of the Misty Mountain Village also returned and were stricken with grief upon seeing how their home had turned out.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that they were able to evacuate quickly. If they were too slow in leaving then they would've died under the collapse.</p>

  <p>Now that the Sun Moon Village could no longer cause trouble for them, the divine citizens could only build new houses on the other hillside. The vegetable field they cultivated fortunately survived. So long as they were alive then the Misty Mountain Village could always be rebuilt.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, now that Luo Zheng's cinnabar field had been unsealed, there was no need for him to stay.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's arrival at the Misty Mountain Village helped Thomson's understanding of martial arts improve by leaps and bounds. However, because there wasn't enough time, he did not manage to make any breakthroughs in his cultivation. Since Luo Luo Zheng was obviously way stronger than Woolley, Thomson was very reluctant to let him leave but he also understood that it would be impossible for him to follow Luo Luo Zheng with his current strength. All he could really do was to secretly cheer himself up and work hard in becoming a future proving godly warrior. Once that happened, he would definitely leave his village and go find his master, Tianxing.</p>

  <p>Half a month later?</p>

  <p>Within an enormous, nameless mountain north of the Vast Sky Region, Luo Luo Zheng stood in front of a protruding wall halfway up the mountain, looking at the snowy plain in the distance.</p>

  <p>The Vast Sky Region was small but it was still bigger than what Luo Luo Zheng imagined. The most terrifying thing about it was that warriors here were forbidden to fly, much less use the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>With just his walking speed, it would probably take him more than a thousand years to cross the entire Vast Sky Region.</p>

  <p>"How far is it?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Soon, on this mountain peak," Master Evil replied.</p>

  <p>In the depths of these mountains were various treasures that Master Evil had hidden in the past. Luo Luo Zheng was now in search of these treasures.</p>

  <p>"Gaa! Gaa!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud caw as dozens of unique-looking Firebirds immediately pounced upon Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He raised his head and there was a sharp glint that flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Gaa!"</p>

  <p>The Firebirds let out a series of blood-curdling screeches as they fell one by one.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was able to easily kill these vicious beasts using soul pressure. It was the easiest and quickest way to do so.</p>

  <p>"Tsk, you're only a world lord and your soul is already this strong. Just how powerful would you be once you manage to condense a Godly Tile in the future?"</p>

  <p>Master Evil couldn't help but ask in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng chose not to reply. Master Evil was already aware of his secrets, including the fact that he was Mike's son and he had enmity with Murphy, but he wasn't about to spill all his secrets to Master Evil anytime soon.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Luo Luo Zheng jumped up sixty to seventy feet in the air. He grabbed hold of a rock on the mountain wall and hauled himself up to the next platform.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng would climb for two days before he eventually reached the peak of the mountain.</p>

  <p>"Do you see that triangular rock?" Master Evil asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked up and indeed saw a tall, triangular rock that looked like a mini pyramid on top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>Using a method taught by Master Evil, Luo Luo Zheng approached the rock and pressed it down. Luo Luo Zheng laughed. "It can't be that someone had already dug out the treasures, right?"</p>

  <p>Four days ago, Luo Luo Zheng had also dug up treasures on another big mountain under Master Evil's guidance. Unfortunately, it seemed someone else had already beaten them to it. This was understandable given that seven divine eras had already passed. Someone was bound to find them.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so." Honestly speaking though, Master Evil couldn't really be too sure.</p>

  <p>Just as he said this, the triangular rock sank and a small hole appeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng. Within the hole were many black discs.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng picked one of the discs and carefully looked at it.</p>

  <p>These discs were rough and contained some kind of special power within them. Luo Luo Zheng couldn't comprehend what specific power it was nor what use it had. "What the hell is this thing? Are they magic treasures or some kinds of rare materials?"</p>

  <p>"Neither," Master Evil answered. "This is the divine land's current currency, the divine might coin."</p>

  <p>"Divine might coin?" Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but roll his eyes. "There's only a few hundred of them. But you've made me travel across mountains and rivers for half-a-month just for this?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had previously planned to head directly to Mirror City which was located in the north of the Vast Sky Region. However, Master Evil had convinced him to search for his hidden treasures with the argument that it would be difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to travel through the Vast Sky Region without them.</p>

  <p>"Don't underestimate the divine might coins. Some True Gods' entire wealth can only be worth up to a few hundred divine might coins,"</p>

  <p>Master Evil told him with a chuckle. "If you don't have any divine might coins, it would be extremely difficult for you to leave the Vast Sky Region. Heck, it would be extremely difficult to even walk a single inch in the divine land!"</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng turned the divine might coins in his hand.</p>

  <p>The universe's currency was the life vitality crystal or life vitality jade.</p>

  <p>They also served as consumables condensed from vitality between heaven and earth that warriors could directly use to replenish life vitality within their cinnabar field.</p>

  <p>These divine might coins were currency used between True Gods who didn't need to consume life vitality but instead relied on the Faith Energy within their inner world. If they operated on the same kind of logic as life vitality crystals, then that could only mean one thing.</p>

  <p>"Is the divine might coin able to replenish the life vitality? Or can it replenish the Faith Energy?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>However, Master Evil shook his head. "No, it can't."</p>

  <p>"Then what's the use of the divine might coins?" Luo Luo Zheng asked once again.</p>

  <p>It had to have some kind of special, attractive quality for the True Gods to value it, otherwise, it was nothing but a pile of trash.</p>

  <p>Master Evil laughed. "The use of the divine might coin is too great.</p>

  <p>Every year, those wealthy clans on the Floating Islands in the Time Sea would fight over it. It can be said that possessing divine might coins is equal to owning everything in the divine land. You will know what exactly these coins are used for in the future. Even if I tell you now, it would simply be useless. Just wait."</p>

  <p>"Possessing the divine might coins means possessing everything in the divine land?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but repeat Master Evil's words. Wasn't the old man exaggerating?</p>

  <p>In the universe, only low-level warriors risked their lives obtaining life vitality crystals and life vitality jades. Higher-level warriors need not bother since they didn't need to replenish their life vitality while fighting.</p>

  <p>Even before they had used up their life vitality, the winner was already decided, so the world lords and Supreme Lords only needed to take hundreds of life vitality jades with them.</p>

  <p>Thus when high-leveled warriors bartered, they usually used objects, weapons, or treasures.</p>

  <p>This black disc in Luo Zheng's hand couldn't be eaten or consumed so how could it be used as currency?</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Master Evil wasn't willing to tell him so he could only give up in the end.</p>
