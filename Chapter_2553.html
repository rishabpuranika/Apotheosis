  <p>
</p>

  <p>Facing the overwhelming forces in the attack of both the middle-aged man and Tyreke of the Yellow Emperor race, Romeo was left with no choice but to retreat.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Rallying the golden glow on the surface of his body, the middle-aged man delivered a stunning series of punches to Romeo's head.</p>

  <p>"Bang, Bang, Bang..."</p>

  <p>Romeo staggered back seven or eight steps in the onslaught, and with every step he took, a huge crater formed in the ground. The Immemorial Wilderness began to shake violently as cataclysmic forces were at work.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had balanced his body, Tyreke charged in closely behind.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Romeo had four hands. He clasped the bamboo sword in one hand and swung it with tremendous force.</p>

  <p>An emerald green sword radiance spewed forth to block Tyreke.</p>

  <p>Tyreke knew fear at the sight of this emerald green sword light. This was probably the only force that could penetrate the Yellow Emperor Wild Body, so he tried his best to avoid it.</p>

  <p>However, just as Tyreke was forced to back off, the middle-aged man stepped up again. As the two tag-teamed in attacking Romeo, he almost had no way to fight back and could only defend himself desperately.</p>

  <p>He didn't even have a spare moment to glance at the battle that Luo Zheng was embroiled in.</p>

  <p>Just now, Luo Zheng had used the soul attack to disrupt Bilaal's soul, which gave Romeo a glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that the combined strength of the other two Wild Gods had proven too weak. They were unable to even dent Bilaal's Yellow Emperor Wild Body. His only glimmer of hope died in the instant that it had been ignited.</p>

  <p>When Bilaal finished off those Wild Gods and joined forces with the middle-aged man and Tyreke to attack him, he would surely perish today.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Romeo felt a pang of sorrow in his heart.</p>

  <p>He was unwilling to face death here in this Immemorial Wilderness. If he could only get some more blood wild bones, then he could even have a chance to become the top warrior among the younger generation!</p>

  <p>As despair set in, even his fighting spirit gradually began to weaken...</p>

  <p>Seeing the middle-aged man rush at him again, he even had a brief urge to simply give up resistance.</p>

  <p>Just then, a voice delivered by chaotic energy echoed into his ears again.</p>

  <p>"Romeo! I'll disturb these two's minds, and you take the chance to vanquish them!"</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>Romeo's eyes flashed in surprise as he looked over and saw Luo Zheng who was several thousand feet away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still hadn't activated the Wild God Power. He hovered in the air like a small mosquito. He was utterly inconspicuous, but in Romeo's eyes, he had become a life-saving straw!</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Romeo clutched the sword tightly with renewed strength in one hand.</p>

  <p>Facing the violent attack of the middle-aged man, he swayed backward and placed one of his arms across his chest to block the attack.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The punch from the middle-aged man landed on his shielding arm.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The arm was immediately bent at a 90 degree angle. It had actually been broken by the sheer force of the middle-aged man's punch!</p>

  <p>The biggest advantage of the Nine Li Wild Body was that it could grow spare limbs, and it had the potential to grow two more heads and four more arms. The flesh of the body was far more solid than that of ordinary Wild Gods, and it could rapidly heal after being injured due to its immense vitality.</p>

  <p>In comparison, the Yellow Emperor Wild Body possessed extremely powerful defensive power.</p>

  <p>Romeo, who had now lost an arm, spun up into the air. The bamboo sword swept out over a distance of over ten thousand feet, forming a huge, glittering arc in the air.</p>

  <p>His sword swept down at Tyreke.</p>

  <p>"Are you now going to risk your life? Unfortunately, your life is utterly worthless. It's a pity that none of you will leave here alive today." The middle-aged man laughed, a hollow and sinister sound.</p>

  <p>As Romeo slashed down at Tyreke with his sword, it presented a good chance for the middle-aged man to counter-attack him. He had the ability to kill Romeo before Romeo's sword came into range of Tyreke.</p>

  <p>Tyreke sneered coldly. This Romeo fellow seemed to have truly given up the fight. It was impossible that this clumsy attack could even scratch him.</p>

  <p>But at the critical moment, both the middle-aged man and Tyreke suddenly sensed a violent flash of light expanding at the corners of their eyes.</p>

  <p>They narrowed their eyes to look, and they saw Luo Zheng who was tiny as a mosquito.</p>

  <p>Romeo's foes were stunned. Neither the middle-aged man nor Tyreke had even guessed that Luo Zheng was still alive.</p>

  <p>After Bilaal had attacked the others, they had assumed he would succeed, and they didn't bother to check the result. As a member of the Yellow Emperor race, it should have been a piece of cake for Bilaal to finish off four mere Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>The moment they focused in on Luo Zheng, they were still unaware that Bilaal had already died. Instead, they were stunned that Luo Zheng had even been able to escape from Bilaal.</p>

  <p>However, just as this thought flashed through their minds, they saw that Luo Zheng had slightly raised his Shadow Bearing Sword and now held it horizontally.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The two-color sword radiance flashed outwards.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Both the middle-aged man and Tyreke immediately felt intense agony as if their heads were being pounded at by a sledge hammer.</p>

  <p>In particular, Tyreke instinctively clutched his head with both hands and roared crazily.</p>

  <p>"Crack?"</p>

  <p>Romeo's sword had already arched out towards Tyreke. If it weren't for the fact that they now suffered from Luo Zheng's soul attack, the middle-aged man could have easily blocked his blow, and Tyreke could have easily avoided the strike.</p>

  <p>However, the whole fight script had been rewritten because of the soul attack!</p>

  <p>Romeo's sword hacked savagely at the golden light on Tyreke's body, and the golden light immediately dimmed before being snuffed out as his body cracked into pieces.</p>

  <p>After the first strike had banished the golden light, a second equally potent sword strike followed.</p>

  <p>This time, the sword plunged into Tyreke's chest. As half of the sword buried into Tyreke's torso, Romeo lowered his body, lifted his sword, and instantly cut Tyreke's head in half!</p>

  <p>After finishing off Tyreke, Romeo turned. Brandishing his sword, he slashed at the middle-aged man.</p>

  <p>Although the middle-aged man had also suffered from Luo Zheng's soul attack, his consciousness had recovered much more swiftly than Tyreke did. In only a few seconds, his eyes had cleared once more.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man was shocked to see that Tyreke had been killed.</p>

  <p>In this world, there were few Wild Gods who had mastered the soul attack, of course, except for the really powerful masters of the various other races. However, those masters were not born in this world at all!</p>

  <p>This guy was then a completely new Wild God. Since the Wild God Power within his body wasn't very strong, then how could he have unleashed such a powerful soul attack?</p>

  <p>Although the middle-aged man was both shocked and scared, his brain was swiftly racing as he considered his options.</p>

  <p>As long as he could kill this guy, Romeo would still be no match for him!</p>

  <p>He took a step to the right, and his mammoth sized body rolled in the air, heading straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!"</p>

  <p>Romeo called a warning to Luo Zheng as he saw the middle aged man's plan.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng floated serenely in the air and watched the middle-aged man's more than ten thousand feet tall body turn on him. It was like watching a huge mountain turning over.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't look panicked at all. As the light of the Shadow Bearing Sword flashed again, a smile lit up his face.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man was once more hit by Luo Zheng's soul attack.</p>

  <p>In agony, he lost his balance and fell heavily on the ground.</p>

  <p>Romeo had gone through many battles, and there was no way that he would let such a good opportunity to kill his enemy slip by.</p>

  <p>He launched upward, and clasped his sword with both hands, prepared to strike. Before the middle-aged man once more regained his consciousness, the bamboo sword in Romeo's hand had struck down at the middle-aged man's head.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The bamboo sword instantly nailed the middle-aged man's head to the ground, cracking it open like a melon.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged man's body struggled reflexively and then finally stopped twitching.</p>

  <p>Romeo clutched the bamboo sword tightly, ready for more actions as the adrenalin coursed in his body, and he was still a little nervous.</p>

  <p>After the middle-aged man's body sagged under its own weight, and it was clear that he had died, the Wild God Power in his body began to dissipate, and his mountainous body began to rapidly shrink.</p>

  <p>Romeo pulled his sword free. His face bubbled with joy as he thought of how narrowly he had escaped from death. He looked over at Luo Zheng, who floated not far away.</p>
