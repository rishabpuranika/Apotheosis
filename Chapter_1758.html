<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1758 The Meeting </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone had been stuck here for quite some time now.</p>

  <p>At Master Feng's summons, Luo Luo Zheng realized that he could finally leave this damned place.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position warrior led the way. Then they met Xenia and continued their journey with her.</p>

  <p>The journey this time felt strange to Luo Luo Zheng and his companions. It was as if someone was following them. Xenia brought everyone into the spatial passageway, then left it, and then repeated this over and over again dozens of times.</p>

  <p>They then entered a large city and once they arrived at a certain residence, began to dive deeper into the cellar. Only after going through a thousand turns of the underground passage did they finally reach their destination.</p>

  <p>The massive underground cave had a number of artificially carved marks on its walls. Many Celestial Position warriors were shuttling back and forth, looking very busy, as if they were on the brink of completing something.</p>

  <p>Bronze pillars over ten feet wide stood at the end of the cave. They weren't supporting the cave, neither did they seem to be able to bear the weight.</p>

  <p>Nathan and Lawson were already impatient.</p>

  <p>"Xenia, what do you plan to do by bringing us so far underground?"</p>

  <p>Nathan asked.</p>

  <p>Xenia turned to glance indifferently at him. "We're almost there. You'll know soon enough."</p>

  <p>Once they had passed the bronze pillars, Nathan's eyes lit up and he rushed forward.</p>

  <p>Just beyond the pillars were a series of oval-shaped steps, and on these steps stood over twenty people.</p>

  <p>These people were the strongest existences in the entire universe, all Supreme Lords who could change the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Nathan had become excited because he had seen the patriarch of his clan.</p>

  <p>"Patriarch!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lords were divided into different levels based on their strengths.</p>

  <p>Nathan's father, the Supreme Lord of Original Sin, the Xuanyuan Clan chief and the leader of the Thoughtless Minds was at the highest point.</p>

  <p>The patriarchs of Lucille's and Lawson's clans stood alongside him.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin only nodded towards Nathan and said rather flatly, "You've arrived."</p>

  <p>Nathan was a little intimidated on seeing so many Supreme Lords standing together and did not approach them. He simply stood together with Tianming and the others.</p>

  <p>Lawson and Lucille also greeted the patriarchs of their clans. This seemed to be an important meeting, what with so many Supreme Lords gathered here. And this meant that as juniors, they were required to behave themselves. The air was solemn, making the ten juniors a little nervous.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Mu Ning were the only juniors who were relaxed and stoic.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had seen this kind of scene before. When he had been besieged, he had turned pale with panic. But he was calm now. He knew that this group of Supreme Lords would not attack him. What made him feel helpless was what Mu Ning was doing at his side.</p>

  <p>"Here."</p>

  <p>A small golden plate containing a strangely shaped purple fruit appeared in Xi Youqin's hands. It was fragrant spirit fruit, a special product of the Purple Power World. This time, she had brought quite a lot of food with her from the Purple Power World.</p>

  <p>Along the way, over 50 different kinds of food had appeared in Xi Youqin's hands, and she had constantly fed Luo Luo Zheng. She was still trying to feed him, which was inappropriate considering the occasion.</p>

  <p>She didn't realize that what she was doing was wrong, even when Luo Luo Zheng waved his hand. "Doesn't it taste good?" She then took out a small pouch and a kind of fruit with thorns from it. "This is a golden-haired chestnut and it tastes even better than the fragrant spirit fruit. I'll peel it for you."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was speechless. He could only wave his hand to stop her. Yet she still didn't have the slightest clue. All he could do was try again to stop her.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Luo Zheng's reminder, Mu Ning looked around and realized there were many powerful people staring at her. She colored and looked apologetic before she hid behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Master Feng's figure appeared not long after.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race was a maverick race. They weren't part of any conflicts with other races and maintained a good relationship with other big races and powers. Master Feng had gathered together the races.</p>

  <p>Master Feng stood facing the Supreme Lords, his back to the juniors. He then said, "I believe you have all understood my prophecy. But even I am unwilling to see my prophecy come true!"</p>

  <p>"This great calamity revealed itself several grand eras ago. We cannot blame you for it," Supreme Lord of Original Sin said.</p>

  <p>"The sorcerer race caused this. Besides running around and causing trouble, what else can those scum that live in the dark side of the world do? If we join hands, annihilating them will be an easy task," Supreme Lord Mathias of the ogre race said loudly.</p>

  <p>He wasn't welcome with the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race was on good terms with most races, but they did not like the ogres, and even had conflicts with them. But right now, the universe was facing a big test, so the Celestial Position had kept their conflict aside and invited the ogres.</p>

  <p>There were small crises in the universe.</p>

  <p>These had already been spread by countless martial artists, making it sound extremely bizarre. But many Supreme Lords knew that this had all been done by the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>This race was an ancient one. They carried powerful curses and roamed the dark side of the world.</p>

  <p>Since they couldn't appear in the real world, they were able to escape the tribulation of the past 3.6 billion years. This was why experts in each round of the heavens did not take them seriously.</p>

  <p>As Supreme Lord Mathias had said, the trouble with the sorcerer race was that they had been constantly shuttling back and forth in the dark of the space. Moreover, their power distribution was very sparse, and their life forms were completely different from the humans. Even if they were wiped out in one place, they would soon emerge and grow powerful in another place.</p>

  <p>But if the entire universe worked together, it would be easy enough to wipe all of them out.</p>

  <p>It had previously been impossible to get all races in the universe to work together. But now that they were facing the same danger, they could consider doing so.</p>

  <p>"Don't underestimate the ancient sorcerer race," said a gentle-looking woman.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords present had lived for at least tens of millions of years. Most of them were either middle-aged men or crappy old men.</p>

  <p>Only this woman seemed to be very young. She looked tender, as if she were made of water. She wore a black robe that hid her figure well.</p>

  <p>"The sorcerer race was cursed and no longer a powerful force. We've always ignored them, but there is one point that we cannot even compare," the woman continued.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord of Oracle, what does that mean?" the patriarch of the Ji Clan asked.</p>

  <p>'So this is the Supreme Lord of Oracle, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought, his eyes glinting.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord of Oracle was the leader of the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>Who would've thought that it would be a woman?</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle's eyes flashed. "They aren't humans or ghosts, but they are, without a doubt, the race that understands the universe the best. No one in the universe can compare to them, not even the Celestial Position race!"</p>

  <p>Master Feng nodded. "Supreme Lord of Oracle is right. Although this sorcerer race is cursed, they have survived so many eras that they definitely know more about the universe than us. If they want to cause trouble, it will be a headache for us too!"</p>

  <p>"Even if that's true, it will be, at most, a mere headache. But all of you act as if the universe itself were about to perish!" Supreme Lord Mathias said coldly.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin, on the other hand, said, "Our opponent is not only the sorcerer race."</p>

  <p>"Then who else is?" Supreme Lord Mathias was angry. His race seemed the slowest, as if they didn't know anything.</p>

  <p>"Gods. True Gods," Master Feng answered.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mathias fell silent at Master Feng's words.</p>

  <p>If the True Gods really wanted to destroy this universe, everyone would be in big trouble.</p>

  <p>But soon, Supreme Lord Mathias realized what was happening.</p>

  <p>"Impossible! Why would the True Gods come to this universe?"</p>

  <p> </p>
