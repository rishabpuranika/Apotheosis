  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng traveled through the stars.</p>

  <p>A huge star swept past his head, and as he gazed at it, all the knowledge of it drilled itself into his mind.</p>

  <p>Its name was Mysterious Earth, and eighty hundred million humans lived on it.</p>

  <p>"There are so many humans on this star, and none of them are secondary creatures from the inner worlds," Luo Zheng murmured to himself, amazed and deep in thought.</p>

  <p>He whizzed past three more stars and once again, their names jumped into his mind.</p>

  <p>There were thirty billion humans living on them. This number was truly impressive.</p>

  <p>He then saw many more stars up ahead.</p>

  <p>Perhaps being in this illusion for too long had slowed him mentally, for it was only now that he suddenly realized that this was the human race's chaotic era, also known as the 77th chaotic era.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had seen the chaotic eras of the Dreaded Eye Demons and the Green Jade Civilization once.</p>

  <p>But whether it was the view shown to him by the Eye of Will or displayed through the Civilization Artifact by the Green Jade Spirit, they both paled in comparison to what he saw now.</p>

  <p>The sheer amount of stars was ridiculous and each star housed hundreds of thousands of humans.</p>

  <p>If he was not aware he had been in an illusion, he would have treated this place as another Source World.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The stars sped up rapidly, zooming in at him and flying by in an instant.</p>

  <p>They varied in size; the small ones were thousands of miles in diameter, while the big ones were tens of millions of miles in diameter.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>After passing through millions of them, finally, Luo Zheng looked upon a gigantic star before him. It was probably over a hundred billion miles in diameter. Its entire body burned a fiery red, its surface a sea of hellfire. Blazing fire dragons spiraled up from the surface, spurting flames towards the sky.</p>

  <p>'Wow, that's incredibly hot...'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought, feeling the heat as he approached the star.</p>

  <p>His body had now returned to its normal state and although the heat was excruciating, he could handle it.</p>

  <p>As he got closer, a massive flame palace came into view below him, entirely dark red with molten lava flowing within.</p>

  <p>In such extreme heat as this, any material would be melted. Who knew what it actually was that flowed like lava?</p>

  <p>Even the fire spirits would find it difficult to survive here. The flame palace appeared to be the core of the entire star.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng landed in front of it, he saw someone ahead.</p>

  <p>It was a man with red hair and red eyebrows, sitting completely naked atop a huge fire lotus. When he saw Luo Zheng, he pointed at him and yelled, "Please sit down!"</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He recalled seeing a statue of this person in the temple.</p>

  <p>"I am Zhurong, the ruler of the Fire Region, and the God of Fire," the red haired man said proudly.</p>

  <p>Two faint flames flickered in his eyes. They looked as though they could burn anything and everything.</p>

  <p>"The God of Fire," Luo Zheng muttered, raising an eyebrow.</p>

  <p>Zhurong was one of the thirty-nine heroes who had put their statues in the temple on the Other Shore. He was probably one of the top masters in the human race.</p>

  <p>"My test is very simple. Please sit next to me for five minutes," said Zhurong calmly, pointing to the fire lotus beside him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng blinked and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he jumped onto the fire lotus.</p>

  <p>The moment he sat down, flames ignited in the eyes of Zhurong's statue in the temple.</p>

  <p>The statue that was looking at the starry pattern noticed what Zhurong was doing. It smiled and said, "This guy just passed the tests of six desires, and now he has to take your test."</p>

  <p>"I will burn him to ashes," the statue of Zhurong replied, soft and frightening.</p>

  <p>The statues finished speaking and Luo Zheng's fire lotus in the starry illusion instantly turned to a blazing white. The white light surged up and enveloped Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Zhurong looked on indifferently.</p>

  <p>He was perpetually irritable and cold-hearted.</p>

  <p>Even though only a wisp of his energy soul was in his statue, he was still incomparably harsh. Meeting him in the first test after the tests of six desires was a bad stroke of luck for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, his indifference didn't last long. Soon, his eyes widened strangely before his expression morphed to outright shock and disbelief!</p>

  <p>Golden vortexes circled Luo Zheng's body and absorbed all the heat from the fire lotus, which hadn't caused him much trouble at all.</p>

  <p>If things went on like this, Luo Zheng would most probably remain safe and sound no matter how long he sat there.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The fire lotus released even more heat.</p>

  <p>Its light turned from blazing white to brilliant blue, reflecting an odd color onto Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>And yet Luo Zheng still sat motionless and unbothered.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>After five minutes, the fire lotus's heat gradually simmered down. Luo Zheng, still sitting on the fire lotus, cupped his hands towards Zhurong and asked,</p>

  <p>"Master Zhurong, have I passed the test?"</p>

  <p>Zhurong looked at Luo Zheng, confused. He had a lot of questions himself.</p>

  <p>But when he created this energy soul, he had set some limitations on it, so he was prevented from asking anything.</p>

  <p>"You may leave now," replied Zhurong briefly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then left the palace and took off at blistering speed, quickly leaving this unimaginably huge star behind him.</p>

  <p>It was as Zhurong said that this area was known as the Fire Region and was once under his control.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Zheng had left the Fire Region, many icy blue stars floated towards him from the distance. They were terrifyingly large, their bodies crystal clear.</p>

  <p>Obviously, they were pure.</p>

  <p>Soon, a pure white star came straight at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The strong stream of air on the outermost side of the star mixed with the snowstorm, capable of tearing through anything in its path.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng entered the interior of the star, only to find it white and strangely quiet.</p>

  <p>A huge ice palace emerged in front of him, a thin man sitting alone inside it.</p>

  <p>His body was a translucent blue with ripples of water flowing across its surface.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could open his mouth to ask, the man introduced himself, "I am Gonggong, the God of Water. Please have a seat."</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng met the God of Fire, the sudden appearance of the God of Water did not surprise him. 'Will all thirty-nine statues test me in turn?' he muttered in his heart.</p>
