  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had ascended into the Upper World and met Yolande, he felt a sense of unfamiliarity.</p>

  <p>In fact, even now, this feeling of strangeness had not yet disappeared.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's eyes, the Yolande in front of him was not any different to the two clones from the Lower World when it came to appearance. However, she was clearly a completely different person.</p>

  <p>In other words, the Yolande he had known had disappeared, replaced by this one.</p>

  <p>Even though the Yolande before him had inherited the memories of the two clones, those memories were just two in a million.</p>

  <p>The reason why Yolande had such a deep impression of Luo Luo Zheng was because she had extracted the memories of him from the memories of a million clones of herself.</p>

  <p>If Yolande had not also extracted her memories of Javier, he would have been a stranger to her.</p>

  <p>Javier had come to the Mist Palace because he had feelings for Yolande, and she had noticed him because of his outstanding performance. She understood his intentions. But it still did not change the fact that he was like a stranger to her.</p>

  <p>However, from the looks of it, Javier would not give up until he had achieved his aim. Luo Luo Zheng shook his head slightly. So what if Javier proved his strength in the future? It was not like Yolande would fall in love with him just because he was powerful. If she were an ordinary woman, it might have been possible. But she was the daughter of a Supreme Lord, and she had power and a high position. How could she give herself over to someone so easily?</p>

  <p>Of course, this had nothing to do with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The warriors below continued to fly toward the Red Cloud Ring in an orderly manner. Those that passed through stood behind the leader and vice leaders of Mist Palace. Those that failed left in disappointment.</p>

  <p>Gradually, fewer and fewer warriors were flying up.</p>

  <p>"Are you still not going?" asked Layla, who was standing next to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You should go up first," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Actually, I want you to go first," said Layla. "But since you suggested it so nicely, I'll go first!"</p>

  <p>The next moment, Layla's feet lightly kicked the ground. She rose up and after circling in the air for a while, she nimbly moved toward the Red Cloud Ring. She turned around and cast a proud smile at Luo Luo Zheng before flying toward the ring.</p>

  <p>The instant Layla passed through the Red Cloud Ring, a scarlet ray of light was released. The ray of light spread rapidly along the ring.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The entire Red Cloud Ring began to hum with a sound.</p>

  <p>At the same time, dazzling rays of light surged up the Red Cloud Ring like waves, unwilling to diminish.</p>

  <p>The light was so bright that the Red Cloud Ring no longer looked like a ring to the crowd below. It was more like a giant fireball or a sun.</p>

  <p>"What a strong response! The woman must be a great talent. How many petals did her Lotus Flower sprout?"</p>

  <p>"Javier's Lotus Flower sprouted nine petals. Could it be that she has surpassed it?"</p>

  <p>"No wonder she is so arrogant, daring to challenge the entire Mist Palace. Her talent is indeed praiseworthy."</p>

  <p>The vice leaders of the Mist Palace held surprised expressions on their faces. They had some information on Layla. Not long ago, she had used the Tiger Roar Token to challenge the talents in the Mist Palace. The vice leaders had asked around and found out that she was the personal disciple of the former leader, so they did not question her further.</p>

  <p>They might as well let her do anything she liked if she was the ex-leader's personal disciple.</p>

  <p>The personal disciple of the former leader was certainly not weak, regardless of strength or talent. However, they had not expected her to trigger such a reaction from the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>Yolande's expression betrayed a trace of surprise. "To make the Red Cloud Ring react this way, her Lotus Flower must have spouted nine petals too."</p>

  <p>"I agree." A vice leader nodded. "It must be so. If my guess is correct, her Nine-petal Lotus Flower should be at the top level. If she can trigger and pass the tenth small Heavenly Tribulation, there might even be a chance to activate the Mahayana Lotus Flower."</p>

  <p>"The Mahayana Lotus Flower..." Another vice leader sighed and added,</p>

  <p>"Master Xiao's luck favors him. He has such a talented personal disciple, and he is about to become a Supreme Lord. What's more, he has managed to avoid the Five Aging Processes. What a fortunate man!"</p>

  <p>The number of warriors in the universe who had activated the Mahayana Lotus Flower were few and far between.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded and smiled. "This girl should have a place in the world of chaos."</p>

  <p>However, she did not dare to confirm this claim. Now that the world of chaos had begun forming and would last for a very long time, many things were unknown and could not be ascertained beforehand. Even if Layla was fated to lead the world of chaos and was the favorite of this era, she might not necessarily be able to become the main character of the era.</p>

  <p>Moreover, from Yolande's point of view, Layla was too arrogant.</p>

  <p id="top_17">Although Yolande had not left her palace in some time, she understood some things, one of which was that Layla provoked Luo Luo Zheng time and again.</p>

  <p>Layla was simply courting death.</p>

  <p>If she continued to do so, no matter how lucky she was, she was doomed.</p>

  <p>Of course, Yolande did not have time to care for such things. She did not give Luo Luo Zheng any advice or special treatment. He had his own fate and she would let him walk his own path.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, why haven't you gone up yet?" Yolande glanced at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Actually, Luo Zheng's and Javier's statuses were very similar. Both of them had ascended to the Upper World. Both had met Yolande's clones while they were still in the Lower World. Both were equally outstanding.</p>

  <p>However, when Yolande read her clones' memories, she was shocked at the information she found regarding Luo Luo Zheng. He was even more impressive than Javier. Yolande's impression of Luo Luo Zheng ran many times deeper than that of Javier.</p>

  <p>Layla floated in the sky. She was introduced into the Mist Palace by the former leader and should have been standing behind Yolande, but she floated alone at the side instead. As for Red Cloud Ring, its brilliance was still as magnificent as before. The fiery red light illuminated her face.</p>

  <p>She looked rather calm despite the shocked gazes of the crowd, but deep inside, she felt somewhat proud.</p>

  <p>That did not mean she was satisfied.</p>

  <p>Her goals were not limited to the small Mist Palace. She was going to face all the top talents in the universe, and she was going to win her place in the world of chaos.</p>

  <p>Passing the Torch was just the beginning of this.</p>

  <p>As the light slowly dimmed down, the Red Cloud Ring returned to its original peaceful state.</p>

  <p>Behind her, several other warriors also flew up. This time, Layla stared down at Luo Luo Zheng. "Luo Luo Zheng, it's your turn. Don't you want to join Passing the Torch?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had repeatedly rejected her challenges, so she had no choice left but to defeat him in Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>Hearing Layla's words, Luo Luo Zheng smiled. Many of the warriors focused their gazes on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Recently, one of the two new talents with impressive performances was Layla, and the other was Luo Luo Zheng. In truth, many of the warriors of Mist Palace were curious as to which of the two was more powerful.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had only fought two warriors at Mist Palace. The first time, he had defeated a warrior from Ice Cloud House. The second time, he had almost taken Jim's life.</p>

  <p>Jim was ranked after two hundred in Swallow Cloud House. It was difficult to ascertain Luo Zheng's true strength from that encounter.</p>

  <p>However, Layla had defeated more than ten people in a row. Among them were those who were ranked among the top few hundred in Swallow Cloud House, and those who were ranked among the top several dozen. The fourth-ranked warrior in Swallow Cloud House had also been defeated by her.</p>

  <p>When Layla passed through the Red Cloud Ring, the light that she attracted was several times brighter than Javier's. It made everyone realize that the girl's potential far exceeded their imagination.</p>

  <p>Therefore, although the vast majority of warriors did not like Layla, they thought she was far stronger than Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Come up!" Layla stretched out her palm toward Luo Luo Zheng. Her five slender fingers were spread open, as if she wanted to give a hand to him, who was more than a few hundred feet away.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and circulated his chaotic energy to slowly float up to the Red Cloud Ring.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng doesn't seem confident enough."</p>

  <p>"No one knows how many petals his Lotus Flower has sprouted. Could it be that it only sprouted three petals? Is he afraid that he can't pass through the Red Cloud Ring?"</p>

  <p>"That's impossible!"</p>

  <p>"There is only a small possibility that he will cross the ring. I know how many petals my Lotus Flower sprouted, and so do you. Look at Luo Luo Zheng! He is hesitating. He is afraid that he can't pass it."</p>
