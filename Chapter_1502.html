<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1502 How To Obtain A Satisfying Heavenly Destiny (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since he had merely obtained a low-rank Law of Causality, he would only be a low-rank Supreme Lord his entire life.</p>

  <p>And because of this, the Celestial Position members killed him.</p>

  <p>Following this, the Supreme Lord who carried the Heavenly Destiny of Rebirth resurrected him.</p>

  <p>After he died, the heavens shook and the Crown of Destiny dissipated.</p>

  <p>After being revived, he became a world lord again.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the Crown of Destiny appeared again, and was captured yet again by the Celestial Position race. This man carried the Heavenly Destiny again but was still not satisfied as the second Law of Causality he had obtained was still a low-rank one.</p>

  <p>The members of the Celestial Position killed him, and the Supreme Lord revived him again. He then carried the Heavenly Destiny again.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race had made full use of this rule to obtain all sorts of strange Laws of Causality.</p>

  <p>For example, he had obtained a Law of Causality that could see through everyone and a Law of Causality that could control the movements of stars. He had once even obtained the Heavenly Destiny of Sound. It was similar to a Roaring Token and could make his voice heard across the whole universe. The Roaring Token was a precious treasure, but if a Supreme Lord's special talent was the same as a Roaring Token, this was not acceptable.</p>

  <p>Most Crowns of Destiny wouldn't be of much use to the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>This had been repeated 13 times, and the Crown of Destiny also dissipated and was reborn 13 times. On the fourteenth time, the Celestial Position race finally obtained a top-rank Law of Causality, which was also the strongest one in the universe. It finally allowed this world lord to become a top-rank Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>He had finally become the leader of the Celestial Position race, and had led the race to this day.</p>

  <p>Other powerful races followed suit once the Celestial Position race had used this rule. For example, the ogres, the Demon Night race, and the humans all wanted to use this method to create a top-rank Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Resurrection of the dead was a very difficult task, but many races could do it, albeit at a high cost. It was just not as easy as it was for the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>After obtaining a Crown of Destiny, the Thoughtless Minds, a human force, picked out a world lord to carry the Heavenly Destiny and become a Supreme Lord. They weren't satisfied with this Heavenly Destiny, so like the Celestial Position race, they killed the Supreme Lord and planned to revive him. Only then did they find they couldn't revive him.</p>

  <p>The ogres and the Demon Night had also done the same experiment.</p>

  <p>They all came to the same conclusion that once a warrior carried a Heavenly Destiny, he or she couldn't be revived after being killed.</p>

  <p>The same method had produced completely different results.</p>

  <p>After much deliberation, many Supreme Lords came to the same conclusion. It seemed that after the Celestial Position race had used this rule to cheat, the heavens had changed this rule. This loophole no longer existed.</p>

  <p>But this also illustrated a problem. The round of heavens had its own thoughts, and it seemed to be constantly repairing itself.</p>

  <p>Or it could be said that someone was managing the heavens. When this person discovered this loophole, he or she changed the rule to prevent these Supreme Lords from using such a method to obtain top-rank Laws of Causality.</p>

  <p>Who was this person? Where was this person?</p>

  <p>This had always been a mystery.</p>

  <p>But this mysterious girl was able to know every single one of the Heavenly Destinies like the back of her hand.</p>

  <p>Was she the manager of the heavens?</p>

  <p>Judging from the fact that her singing could cause massive beast attacks to erupt in a hundred thousand supreme worlds, combined with her infinite usage of the Roaring Token, many Supreme Lords unanimously came up with this answer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know the story, so Xun told him about it. Then he understood it in an instant.</p>

  <p>If this mysterious girl was the manager of the heavens, he would ask her Yan's whereabouts. However, before he could say anything, the other Supreme Lords burst out, unable to restrain themselves.</p>

  <p>"Young lady, you did not come personally. How do you know which Supreme Lords died and which Heavenly Destinies vanished?" a Supreme Lord asked, using the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>The girl giggled. "Do you want to know the answer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Supreme Lord said.</p>

  <p>"But I won't tell you," she replied. "You bunch of old guys won't beg that of me, right?"</p>

  <p>At her words, the Supreme Lords scattered throughout the 100, 000 supreme words fumed in sullen anger. But none of them scolded her, since they knew that they could afford to offend neither Luo Zheng nor her.</p>

  <p>They could only swallow the humiliation and say nothing in return.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Luo Zheng laughed at the girl's answer.</p>

  <p>"What are you laughing at?" The girl turned her attention to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled and said, "Nothing. Hey, can you do me a favor?"</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng had never expected was the girl to take the lead before he could say anything. "Looking for Yan Luo, right?" she said.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart sped up at the indication that she knew something.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am looking for a woman called Yan Luo. Do you know where she is?" Although his voice was calm, truth was that he was extremely excited, and it was hard to conceal his excitement.</p>

  <p>But the girl's next sentence filled Luo Zheng with disappointment.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It's just that you said that you were looking for her the last time," she said, seeming to sense Zheng's mood.</p>

  <p>At this, not only were the Supreme Lords infuriated, even Luo Zheng wanted to scold her.</p>

  <p>Xun snorted. She looked up at the sky and said, "Ignore her. She's just another stupid woman!"</p>

  <p id="top">Luo Zheng shrugged and prepared to put away the Roaring Token. But the mysterious girl said something that stopped him short. "I can ask around for you. But I have a condition."</p>
