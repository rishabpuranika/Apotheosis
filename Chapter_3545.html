<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3545 The Food For Purified Beings </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The green-skinned men were the weakest creatures in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>They had little understanding of how harmful the light rays were.</p>

  <p>As expected, light rays could erode their bodies easily.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, while the Dark Nether Bugs were very powerful creatures in the Dark Region, they were not very intelligent. The green-skinned men would lure the Dark Nether Bugs with candlelight and then capture them with overpowering drugs.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, they couldn't even face the Dark Nether Bugs head on. They would have to retreat.</p>

  <p>But Feng Ge had cut down three powerful Dark Nether Bugs in an instant!</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned men were astonished.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge stepped into the range of the candlelight without hesitation after killing the Dark Nether Bugs.</p>

  <p>"Be careful! The candlelight!"</p>

  <p>"The light will erode you!" the two green-skinned men called out to Feng Ge urgently.</p>

  <p>They had earlier wanted to run away, afraid they might get killed by the Dark Nether Bugs. But there was no need to retreat now that the threat had been extinguished. Now, they wanted to stay to get on Zheng and Feng Ge's good graces.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned men had never seen creatures from the Light Region before. For them, everything from the Light Region was incomprehensible and untouchable.</p>

  <p>Both Feng Ge and Zheng were from the Light Region, so of course light did not harm them.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned men realized this as Feng Ge stepped into the light.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"She is unfazed by the candlelight! Has she eaten the Light Fruit?"</p>

  <p>They stared wide-eyed, marveling at Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Except for the Dark Nether Bugs, they knew no other creature who could remain unscathed by the candlelight. Even the ground itself would be corroded if the light shone long enough. But here came this woman, stepping into the light like it was nothing!</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's eyes were fixed at the dead bodies of the Dark Nether Bugs as she stepped into the illuminated area.</p>

  <p>The strong smell of blood filled her nose. The temptation grew even more irresistible. She strode toward one of the bodies, buried her hand into it, and pulled out blood vessels.</p>

  <p>Before Feng Ge could put them into her mouth, Zheng quietly appeared by her side, staying her hand.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" Feng Ge asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "I know you want to eat this, but try to hold off until we're certain it's safe," he said.</p>

  <p>After all, they had no idea where the Dark Nether Bugs came from and whether they were poisonous or not. One couldn't just consume them carelessly.</p>

  <p>"But..." A look of pained frustration crossed Feng Ge's face.</p>

  <p>Her bodily instincts were telling her these Dark Nether Bugs were her food.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's words made her snap out of it. How could she eat such disgusting things?</p>

  <p>Feng Ge felt torn between impulse and reason.</p>

  <p>At that moment, one of the green-skinned men stood at the edge of the illuminated area. "The Dark Nether Bugs are inedible. They are fatally poisonous to us, especially their blood. If we eat it, we bleed to death," he warned.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Zheng's resolve to stop Feng Ge just grew stronger.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge put down the bloody mess, but she continued to look wistfully at it, unwilling to part from it. She looked miserable, as if she had just been deprived of the most delicious food.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you can't eat the Dark Nether Bugs, why do you capture them?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked, turning to the two green-skinned men. They had worked so hard on the Dark Nether Bugs' capture. They must have some value to them.</p>

  <p>"These bugs are for the Royal Monkey race. Of course we can't eat them.</p>

  <p>Even if they were for us, we wouldn't dare eat them," one of the green-skinned men explained.</p>

  <p>"The Royal Monkey race?" Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly. "You mean the black monkeys in the Dark Region?"</p>

  <p>When the green-skinned men heard Zheng's description, their faces turned pale. "Don't call them that! They'll kill you!" one of them hissed anxiously.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the Royal Monkey race was quite influential in the Dark Region. The green-skinned men were terrified of them even when they weren't around.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. "Then what will the Royal Monkey race do with the Dark Nether Bugs? Are they the ones who eat them?"</p>

  <p>"Of course they don't eat them either," one of the green-skinned men said.</p>

  <p>"The Dark Nether Bugs are highly poisonous to all living creatures, except to our stage ruler, for whom they are a delicacy. That is why we have to turn in the Dark Nether Bugs we capture to the Royal Monkey race."</p>

  <p>"Your stage ruler?" Zheng and Feng Ge shot each other a look.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the most powerful being in the whole world!" A look of piety crossed the green-skinned men's faces.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned men were natives in the Dark Region. They didn't know much about the outside world. The Dark Region was their entire world.</p>

  <p>They had no idea of the existence of the Other Shore or its stages. Neither did they know of the Source World.</p>

  <p>In their minds, the stage ruler was the most powerful existence, and therefore, the one god.</p>

  <p>Although they were coerced to capture Dark Nether Bugs for offerings, their resentment only extended to the Royal Monkey race, who made the direct demands. They had no hatred for their stage ruler at all.</p>

  <p>But Zheng and Feng Ge knew that this stage ruler was nothing but a purified being in a stage of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Since the stage ruler could eat the Dark Nether Bugs, most likely, so could Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Seeing Feng Ge's eyes brighten up at this realization, Zheng shook his head again. "You can store these Dark Nether Bugs in your space ring first. Once we confirm they are safe to consume, I would let you."</p>

  <p>If the stage ruler constantly needed to consume the Dark Nether Bugs, it probably meant they were good for purified beings. But they had to be sure.</p>

  <p>Once they verified this, Zheng himself would recommend Feng Ge consume them.</p>

  <p>It took Feng Ge a great deal of effort to suppress her instincts. She activated the space ring and waved it lightly over the bodies, which were immediately absorbed.</p>

  <p>The green-skinned men had never seen a space ring before. They were once again dumbfounded when the carcasses disappeared.</p>

  <p>Once the bodies were stored away, the smell of blood also gradually disappeared. Before long, Feng Ge felt a little better, the impulse having subsided.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared steadily at the green-skinned men. "Do you bring the captured Dark Nether Bug to the Royal Monkey race yourselves?"</p>

  <p>"No," one of the green-skinned men answered, shaking his head. "We're not allowed to enter their territory."</p>

  <p>"The Royal Monkeys will come pick up the Dark Nether Bug tomorrow.</p>

  <p>That's why our Insect Master race has deployed hundreds of insect catchers.</p>

  <p>We will be in great trouble if we can't deliver," the other green-skinned man continued.</p>

  <p>For the Royal Monkeys, the Insect Master race's lives had no value at all.</p>

  <p>All they were good for, they thought, was catching the Dark Nether Bugs.</p>
