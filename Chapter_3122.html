<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I'm not curious..." Luo Zheng shrugged as he said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Disappointed by his reaction, Qiu Yinhe said, "That is a Chaos Ancient God living outside of the Source World. With the support of the Chaos Ancient God, the Bearing race continues to prosper over the years!</p>

  <p>They have already exterminated nine small races. Besides, thirteen other races have been forced to surrender to them. And Emperor Di Jun has also made his decision."</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng went to the Mountain Viewing Province, he learned that Emperor Di Jun was the leader of the Jin Wu. Now that the Jin Wu was engaged in a war against the Taiyi Heaven Palace, could that mean...</p>

  <p>"Master Qiu Yinhe, are you implying that Emperor Di Jun has also chosen the Purge Way?" Luo Zheng asked in concern.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe nodded. He stared at Luo Zheng and smiled, "You have been hiding your origin all this time. If you are indeed from the Nine Li race, then you should understand the intentions of the Taiyi Heaven Palace by now. We have no conflict with the Nine Li race. As a matter of fact, we're on the same side.</p>

  <p>We should be friends."</p>

  <p>The reason why he said so much was to dispel Luo Zheng's doubts.</p>

  <p>A long silence lingered in the air before Luo Zheng spoke, "Master Qiu Yinhe, that is a lot of information for me to process at once. May I have some time to think about it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sure!" Qiu Yinhe said politely. "Even if you don't trust the Taiyi Heaven Palace and insist on leaving, I will personally send you to any place of your choosing in the Source World."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he nodded to Luo Zheng and waved his hand gently.</p>

  <p>In response to his hand gesture, a long sword sprang out from the sheath around his waist. It rotated around in the air for a few seconds and gradually grew in size. It appeared to be the Lofty Sword that Luo Zheng had seen before.</p>

  <p>However, this one was different in size from the ones he saw in the Grand River Fortress and the Sword Light Palace. The one in front of him was much smaller. It was only a few hundred feet long.</p>

  <p>"Come on! I'll send you back to the Grand River Fortress," Qiu Yinhe said while gesturing Luo Zheng towards the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hopped on to the Lofty Sword with Qiu Yinhe. Then it carried their weights and flew in the southern direction.</p>

  <p>Immediately, Luo Zheng plopped down on the sword with his legs crossed, and his eyes shut as if to concentrate. Quietly, he asked in his mind, "No. 9527, is everything he said true?"</p>

  <p>Of course, No. 9527 was informed about matters such as this, but it had never mentioned to Luo Zheng before.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's highly possible, but he didn't tell us everything. He didn't know..." No. 9527 replied calmly.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me this sooner?" Luo Zheng asked again with a hint of disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Why should I tell you?" No. 9527 asked defensively.</p>

  <p>Every time, No. 9527 would give him vague responses and would seldom reveal anything informative. Luo Zheng even had no clue about the function of the candles he took from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"If I could know earlier, I could prepare myself accordingly," Luo Zheng sighed.</p>

  <p>"Your cultivation base is too weak. No matter how you take precautions, it is useless..." Feeling Luo Zheng's helplessness, No. 9527 felt sympathetic and said,</p>

  <p>"Actually, there are more than two options to deal with the chaos. For example, there is also the Nihility Way."</p>

  <p>"What does that mean?"</p>

  <p>"This is almost the same as Xuanyuan's idea. What Xuanyuan wants is to control the chaotic situation, yet the Nihility Way is more severe. That is to terminate the chaos into oblivion..." No. 9527 answered calmly.</p>

  <p>"Are these people crazy?" Luo Zheng felt a stinging headache after hearing the absurd things.</p>

  <p>"From their point of view, the Finale Way is also a crazy idea," No. 9527 responded.</p>

  <p>It was hard for different people with different mindsets to come to a common ground. What was right for one person was wrong to the other.</p>

  <p>Each of them had their own beliefs. Any form of opposition to it was not well-received.</p>

  <p>As a result, differences in opinion led to disputes, and as time progressed, the hostility grew more violent and vicious.</p>

  <p>In the Excellence City.</p>

  <p>After the end of winter, the seaway became more bustling than usual.</p>

  <p>The turmoil in the Seven-Star Province had once made the people in the Excellence City panic and fear.</p>

  <p>After all, the human race of the Gracious Province all relied on the protection of the Sword Light Palace. But now, with the source of their protection destroyed, they were in constant fear of being attacked by nonhuman creatures with ill intentions.</p>

  <p>In particular, the Man-eating Demon Flowers, and the thought of them breaching the city and devouring it whole terrorized them.</p>

  <p>Last year, some people from the Sand Country even broke into the Excellence City without a hitch and alerted the head of the city, so they killed those people who leaned on the Man-eating Demon Flowers.</p>

  <p>But then came winter and new messages from the Seven-Star Province along with it.</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace was going to be rebuilt from scratch.</p>

  <p>The fearsome king and the foundation of the Man-eating Demon Flowers in the Gracious Province had been killed.</p>

  <p>For so many years, the Sword Light Palace had struggled to subdue them, but now it was over.</p>

  <p>The whole Excellence City celebrated and rejoiced under the triumph for several days.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a black flying boat quietly landed at the wharf of the Excellence City.</p>

  <p>Several women were seen stepping down from it.</p>

  <p>Each woman was covered in a silver-colored veil. The veils made it hard to make out their features, and even their cultivation bases were suppressed.</p>

  <p>Even so, their strong presence instilled deep pressure on the onlookers.</p>

  <p>The woman in the lead had a strange uniqueness. She stood out from all the other ladies at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>"Take us to the Mice League." The woman in the lead tossed a few divine crystals at a fellow on the deck.</p>

  <p>Most races of the Source World loathed the Ear Mouse race, but when they needed information to be obtained quickly, they could only seek help from them. As long as they were prepared to pay the price of the news they were willing to attain, they could take advantage of their presence.</p>

  <p id="top_18">The man's eyes lit up with joy as he collected the crystals. He then bowed to them and obediently led the way.</p>

  <p>From the group of women, one of them stepped out and entered the gate of the Mice League.</p>

  <p>After the passing of an hour, she came out.</p>

  <p>Although her face was covered by the veil, her disappointment was noticeable. Her head hung loosely from her neck, and her bright eyes now seemed dark.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he did come here, but he was taken away by someone else..." she said with low spirits.</p>

  <p>"Who picked him up?" the leading woman asked with her arms crossed.</p>

  <p>"Someone from the Sword Light Palace in the Seven-Star Province, and...</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace seems to have been destroyed and it's being rebuilt." She now looked even more tensed.</p>

  <p>The woman in the lead put her arm around her and comforted her,</p>

  <p>"Everything should be fine. Since the Sword Light Palace is being rebuilt, we can go to the Seven-Star Province and find out his whereabouts."</p>

  <p>"Yes..."</p>

  <p>The two women nodded to each other, and they all went straight to the quay without looking back. All of them boarded the black flying ship and headed off to the Seven-Star Province.</p>

  <p>The women were from the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>The day Emily and Luo Zheng separated, they had decided to meet at the Excellence City.</p>

  <p>But she was being chased by Sanjay and had to lose him before she could go look for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It would have been risky to go to the Excellence City while she was being watched, so she had to take Yan to the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Inside Emily's inner world, Yan was oblivious to the outside world. When she was finally released and could not find Luo Zheng, she immediately turned to Emily to ask where he was.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to lie to her, Emily told her everything she knew about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Yan suddenly became worried about her brother. His location was not known, and the Source World was dangerous.</p>

  <p>Even though the Li Shan mountain was peaceful and offered a favorable environment for cultivation, Yan had no plans on staying.</p>

  <p>Giving in to her wishes, Emily and Yan set out with strong warriors of the Li Shan mountain to the Gracious Province in search of Luo Zheng.</p>
