  <p>
</p>

  <p>Before heading to the Ginkgo Pavilion, Xun had thoroughly considered the pros and cons of her journey.</p>

  <p>With the authority and confidence she possessed, it was sure that this tenth grade sacred place in the Dark World would submit to her and her alone.</p>

  <p>But subduing a tenth grade sacred place was practically meaningless to her, and it was in fact, dangerous. It would help her very little in her fight against Yao and would alert the enemy too.</p>

  <p>All of her activities would have to be done in secret. The fewer people knew about it, the better.</p>

  <p>The Ginkgo Pavilion had been set up in Auspice City by the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place. It was basically a trade-hub that spent much time trading with the other forces in Auspice City, which meant it always had a rich collection of treasures and abundant resources at hand.</p>

  <p>After taking a look at the resources they had, Xun merely shook her head. None of them had caught her eye.</p>

  <p>After all, the Dark World was just a small place at the outskirts of the Upper World, and was nothing when compared to the Mist Palace. These resources might have been extremely precious to some ordinary warriors, but they were of no use to Xun or Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She was far more concerned about the secret treasures of the Dark World.</p>

  <p>In any case, although the resources and treasures that lay there did not catch her eyes, she did pick up quite a lot of life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>Every year, when the Ginkgo Pavilion traded with the other races, they turned over the life vitality jades to the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place, which meant that there was an abundance of them in here.</p>

  <p>To not arouse suspicion at the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place and protect Nela, who was in charge of handing over all the life vitality jades to the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place, Xun only took about one fifth of them. Even then, the number of life vitality jades she collected was close to thirty thousand.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng no longer needed life vitality jades because of the enormous changes that had happened inside his body. However, the more money and treasures one had, the better. It might come in handy some day.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Luo Zheng had risked his life to gather about a hundred life vitality jades. To any warrior of the Soul Sea Realm, these thirty thousand life vitality jades were no less than an enormous fortune.</p>

  <p>After staying in the Ginkgo Pavilion for two days, Nela resigned from her post in the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place. Then she found an excuse to leave and set out to the Eternal Night World with the jade slip that Xun had given her.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Luo Luo Zheng quietly returned to his residence in Auspice City, waiting for the arrival of Lincoln.</p>

  <p>Some months earlier, Lincoln and Luo Luo Zheng had agreed to meet each other in half a year. In the blink of an eye, time had gone by and now, only some forty days or so were left till the day they were supposed to meet. Luo Luo Zheng was actually worried whether Lincoln would arrive here at the scheduled time or not.</p>

  <p>One and a half months later?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still immersed in his cultivation.</p>

  <p>After breaking through to the Soul Sea Realm, his cultivation had increased and his strength had improved greatly. He had also been comprehending higher levels of the different Law Powers and the Stellar Body in an orderly manner.</p>

  <p>Very occasionally, he would find himself able to communicate with several stars. Perhaps it was because he had absorbed the Luck-devouring Snakes that his luck seemed to have increased now.</p>

  <p>In fact, when Luo Luo Zheng had just absorbed the Luck-devouring Snakes on Willow Island, his luck had, for the moment, risen greatly. For some time, he had become the favored one of the entire world, with his luck reaching a point where almost all his wishes came true. However, that extreme good luck hadn't lasted long and was gone after a few hours.</p>

  <p>In the following days, his luck seemed to have returned to normal. Or it might have increased a bit. In any case, luck was an abstract concept that was somewhat difficult to define, and there was no way for him to measure it with a scale.</p>

  <p>The only thing he could be sure of was that it was relatively easier for him now to draw upon the power of the stars. So either his strength, or his luck, or both had increased.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was also troubled by the fact that the chaotic energy inside his body still wasn't showing any signs of liquefying.</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, by the time a warrior broke through to the Soul Sea Realm, his life vitality should have already begun to liquefy.</p>

  <p>However, the chaotic energy inside him was still rolling around in his cinnabar field like waves.</p>

  <p>He couldn't find anything in the Primal Chaos Technique to explain this, nor did he have any books that talked of this matter. His master had only speculated that like the life vitality, the chaotic energy would also turn into the chaotic sea. However, it was obvious that his master's deduction was wrong, at least at this stage.</p>

  <p>'To condense life vitality, one has to compress it to the limit in order to liquefy it, much like any gas would behave.</p>

  <p>But it is very difficult to produce chaotic energy in the first place. It cannot be replenished by absorbing life vitality from the outside world, and the chaotic energy itself is relatively slow in production. How can one possibly compress it?'</p>

  <p>For the last few days, Luo Luo Zheng had been deeply troubled by this problem. In order to find a solution, he would occasionally venture out to refresh his mind, hoping to obtain some enlightenment?</p>

  <p>While he was thinking about it, Luo Luo Zheng would also often converse with the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Among the Genuine Dragons, the cyan dragon had extensive experience and vast knowledge. However, when it came to Luo Zheng's problem, even he seemed to have no idea why things were what they were. The cyan dragon was familiar with the life vitality system, and the red dragon was familiar with the body refining system. They specialized in two different areas but the cultivation method of the chaotic system was simply unheard-of to them.</p>

  <p>However, the cyan dragon did have a suggestion to give that piqued Luo Zheng's interest!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had been in the Eastern Region, he had once obtained a cultivation method of the ogre race called the "Heavenly Ogre Fist". It had played an extremely important role for him when he had begun to learn the martial arts.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the cyan dragon, the fist intent and moves contained in the Heavenly Ogre Fist were nothing special, but the demonic life energy cultivated from the Heavenly Ogre Fist had very interesting properties.</p>

  <p>This demonic life energy could almost completely devour other life energies and make them its own.</p>

  <p>As time passed, Luo Luo Zheng had become more focused on learning other cultivation methods and had stopped practicing the Heavenly Ogre Fist.</p>

  <p>But now that the cyan dragon brought it up, it provided Luo Luo Zheng with a new way of thinking.</p>

  <p>Although the cyan dragon wasn't clear about the reason why Luo Luo Zheng was unable to liquefy his chaotic energy, the way he saw it, there was a very high probability that the amount of chaotic energy that Luo Luo Zheng had was not enough to be compressed into a liquid. Therefore, the cyan dragon had a bold idea, suggesting that Luo Luo Zheng use the mind method recorded in the Heavenly Ogre Fist and make chaotic energy possess the ability of devouring power.</p>

  <p>When he heard this suggestion, Luo Zheng's gaze flickered slightly. This idea could probably work. And he couldn't wait to try it out.</p>

  <p>The path he was on was a road never taken before. He had to grope around to progress all by himself anyway. This gave him an advantage; even if he went wrong, he could start over again, and he would not be stuck with the rules of this universe. After all, he had seen his master travel in the chaos and vaguely knew that this Primal Chaos Technique had already surpassed the rules of this universe. This meant that there were no bounds on it.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng still stuck to the rules, then he would be too pedantic.</p>

  <p>When the idea was suggested, Luo Luo Zheng didn't waste any time and immediately started to practice according to the mind method recorded in the Heavenly Ogre Fist.</p>

  <p>Using chaotic energy to activate other cultivation methods wasn't something new. For example, any law power when activated by chaotic energy would increase several times. For that reason, Luo Luo Zheng had strong expectations with his experiment, and was quite confident that the chaotic energy would be able to generate the "demonic life vitality".</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng practiced the mind method in the Heavenly Ogre Fist, the chaotic energy within his body boiled?</p>

  <p>A trace of chaotic energy extricated itself from Luo Zheng's cinnabar field and circulated along his meridians. Finally, it shot out from his fingertip. A thin strand of gray chaotic energy, much like a thick mist began to float around his hand.</p>

  <p>'This strand of chaotic energy was activated by the mind method of Heavenly Ogre Fist. I wonder if it possesses the devouring power.' Luo Luo Zheng was a little nervous, but in the blink of an eye, his nervousness completely disappeared and eagerness took its place. He laughed and thought to himself, 'Even if I fail, I can look for another method. Who's there to stop me? What is there to be nervous about?'</p>

  <p>Thinking about that, he reached into his space ring and brought out a supreme life vitality crystal. Streams of thick life vitality were preserved in this small stone.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not immediately crush the life vitality crystal. Instead, he gently tapped the stone with his finger and a small hole appeared. A wisp of pure life vitality flowed out from the hole!</p>

  <p>Before it could properly escape, Luo Luo Zheng injected the chaotic energy on his fingertips into the life vitality crystal, his eyes staring straight at it with a firm gaze.</p>

  <p>"Not working?"</p>

  <p>Through the transparent stone shell, Luo Luo Zheng could see that the brown chaotic energy was continuously swirling within the life vitality crystal. It didn't fuse with the milky white life vitality within the crystal, nor did it show any signs of trying to devour the life vitality?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng curled his lips. It seemed that he'd been too naive and the experiment had failed.</p>

  <p>'Ah well. Wait!' Just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to put the life vitality crystal back into his space ring, the entire crystal suddenly exploded right in front of him!</p>
