  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had cleaned his body, he checked his surroundings.</p>

  <p>Except for the hexagram array in the center, there was nothing else in the room.</p>

  <p>An idea popped out of his mind. "Now that I've returned to normal, what if I walk out of this room?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>Driven by curiosity, he walked towards the door of the room.</p>

  <p>When he reached the door, however, something strange happened. The moment he stepped out, countless thin black threads suddenly appeared in the passage.</p>

  <p>The thin black threads formed a net that blocked his path.</p>

  <p>"Don't try to challenge the rules they've set, lest you cause unnecessary trouble," the Primeval Lord of Heaven warned.</p>

  <p>Judging from the number of the hexagram arrays the Instant Civilization had arranged, it wasn't easy to open a room of the hexagram array. Anyone who broke into the area outside the room by force would bring great pressure to the Eternal Scroll Painting. No one knew what would happen after that.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to exert even more strength, he retreated when he heard the Primeval Lord of Heaven's words.</p>

  <p>After he stepped into the hexagram array, he turned into a picture again.</p>

  <p>Egan and Kirk had been watching outside for a long time. When they saw Luo Zheng exit the room, both of them immediately went to him.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, your body is immune to the poison! What a truly great advantage,"</p>

  <p>Egan said with admiration.</p>

  <p>Members of various Other Shore races in the Grand Plain Stage had different body shapes, but only a few of them were truly unafraid of the poison.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the venom of the Poisonous Leech was quite special, and even the few creatures with the poison resistant physique found it hard to resist the Poisonous Leeches' attack. "Aside from the Poisonous Leeches, are there any other creatures on this path?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Egan became cautious. "It was easy to pass through this path before. In the past, everything went smoothly as long as one went through the corridor with Poisonous Leeches, but now, it's hard to say in this special period," he said.</p>

  <p>When the Eternal Scroll Painting opened this time, there was something wrong on the first and second pages. Thus, how could the remaining path be so easy to pass?</p>

  <p>The three of them advanced into the depths of the No-break Maze once again. Then, several more forks appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>Since Kirk was familiar with the forks, he chose the direction without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Some beasts in the scroll painting came from both of their sides along the way. The beasts weren't that strong, but before Luo Zheng could attack them, both Kirk and Egan already killed them.</p>

  <p>However, they did encounter one tricky thing: it was a spider the same size as Luo Zheng, and there was a hexagram array not far away from the spider.</p>

  <p>This time, Egan entered the hexagram array and returned to his normal form. Then, he asked Kirk to provoke the spider and lure it into the room with the hexagram array.</p>

  <p>The moment the spider entered the room, Egan's forehead suddenly released a ray of light.</p>

  <p>Outside the room, Luo Zheng saw a ray of black light flash above Egan's head. He didn't know what kind of powerful token the black light was. In just a second, the light sliced the spider in half.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng first saw Egan in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, the stage suppressed the latter's true power. Therefore, he didn't think that Egan was strong.</p>

  <p>Now that Egan had returned to the Grand Plain Stage, he was indeed extraordinarily powerful. After all, he was the best warrior among the young generations of the Three Eyes race. His strength was only second to those of the Eternal Realm masters of his race.</p>

  <p>Once they had dealt with the spider, the three of them set off again.</p>

  <p>There were no longer any forks on the path. The other paths in the No-break Maze began to converge, and they saw members from the other races of the Other Shore on their way.</p>

  <p>Although the Three Eyes race was neutral in the Grand Plain Stage, they had a good relationship with the other races of the Other Shore. Egan was young, but he seemed to get along well with the others in Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore. Thus, he took the initiative to communicate with the Other Shore creatures and roughly understood the situation.</p>

  <p>The other paths had also changed, but the overall change wasn't that big.</p>

  <p>Only a few members of the Other Shore races encountered great danger, but most of them passed safely.</p>

  <p>At that rate, it wouldn't be long before they passed through the maze and went to the third page.</p>

  <p>Thoughts about the high possibility of becoming Eternal Realm masters filled the Other Shore creatures' minds, which boosted their morale and increased their speed.</p>

  <p>"The end of the No-break Maze is right in front of us. It's also the most dangerous area," said Egan.</p>

  <p>The entire No-break Maze looked like a huge spindle. There was only one entrance and one exit, so all the Other Shore creatures would eventually gather together.</p>

  <p>No matter which path they chose in the maze, there was no easy way to pass through it, and the end of the maze was the most difficult and dangerous of them all.</p>

  <p>Just as Egan, Luo Zheng, and the others arrived at the end of the maze, three Other Shore creatures stood in front of them.</p>

  <p>The one on the left was none other than Walden of the Violet Cloud race.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you move along?" Egan asked.</p>

  <p>Walden observed Luo Zheng, Egan and Kirk for a while, especially since Luo Zheng looked very much like a member of the Three Eyes race. At that point, only through the lack of an eye on Luo Zheng's forehead, one could tell him from the other two.</p>

  <p>When Walden realized that Luo Zheng had also passed smoothly, he looked slightly disappointed. The human brat made it through the maze alive?</p>

  <p>Then, he said, "The end of the No-break Maze is right in front of us. It used to be very dangerous. I wonder what kind of powerful creature is there this time, but we won't dare to go there. Will you try?"</p>

  <p>Egan blinked his eyes and took a step back, while Luo Zheng stood still as if he hadn't heard what Walden said.</p>

  <p>It would be fine if Walden didn't say anything, but now his words made Luo Zheng and the others more vigilant.</p>

  <p>Five Other Shore creatures explored the maze together with Walden. The six of them cooperated well with each other, so they were the first to arrive at the end of the maze.</p>

  <p>Based on the principle of teamwork, they planned to go directly out of the No-break Maze and enter the third page.</p>

  <p>As soon as they rushed forward, however, a large black creature appeared.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be a big black snake, and its enormous body occupied almost the maze's whole passageway!</p>

  <p>Walden and two of his companions reacted very quickly. The moment they saw the big black snake come out from one side, they used almost all of their strength to retreat to the passageway.</p>

  <p>However, the three Other Shore creatures that were in front weren't so lucky. They didn't even have time to call for help before the black snake swallowed them.</p>

  <p>The big black snake was so strong that resistance was futile. That was why Walden and his group waited in their spot.</p>

  <p>When he saw Luo Zheng and the others arrive, he suddenly had a wishful thought.</p>

  <p>He hoped that Luo Zheng would risk his life to deal with the huge snake. He didn't expect that Luo Zheng would turn a deaf ear to his words!</p>

  <p>Not long after, more and more Other Shore creatures came out from the different paths in the No-break Maze and gathered in the same area.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you all move forward?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the beast guarding the exit of the No-break Maze is not easy to deal with this time!"</p>

  <p>Of course, the Other Shore creatures had different personalities.</p>

  <p>Some of them were quite patient and chose to plan before they took action, while others were very irritable and rash.</p>

  <p>When no one wanted to go forward, a tall and burly member of the Earth Tremor race squeezed out of the crowd and stood in front of everyone. "It's not a good idea for you to only wait here. Let me step forward and have a look," he announced.</p>

  <p>He quickly stepped forward after he spoke. As soon as he walked away, a large black shadow emerged from the other side of the passageway. It opened its big, black, bloody mouth and closed it right after. At the same time, the member of the Earth Tremor race disappeared from everyone's sight.</p>
