<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4317 Born By Accident </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although everyone thought they had been mentally prepared for the coming of the downgrade, when they heard the words coming from Luo Zheng himself, their faces darkened.</p>

  <p>"Will we live? And for how long?" Hilario asked as he trembled.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned around and pointed at the distance. "The downgrade starts from that direction and will rapidly spread out in all directions. I might have to take you far away from here as possible."</p>

  <p>Whether they could live or not and how long they could live was not even answerable by Luo Zheng, yet everyone perfectly understood what he meant.</p>

  <p>After having experienced countless disasters, these people in the Immortal Mansion managed to stay calm.</p>

  <p>As Lorena leaned on Mike's shoulder, her eyes swept over Luo Zheng, Luo Nian, and Yan and her lips curled into a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Now that all her enemies had died, she had no regrets in life. She saw herself already very lucky to be able to spend her remaining time with her family.</p>

  <p>Tianming, Bromley, and the others also displayed a seemingly odd composure.</p>

  <p>"Alas, it's a pity that my long-cherished wish hasn't been fulfilled yet,"</p>

  <p>Fuxi blurted out downheartedly.</p>

  <p>"What long-cherished wish?" Luo Zheng asked, looking at him in curiosity.</p>

  <p>"To break the needle!" revealed Fuxi.</p>

  <p>A long time ago, Fuxi had made up his mind to prevent the end of the chaos and become the Finale Hero. However, things had drastically changed, and the needle that had appeared at the end of this round of chaos was so powerful to the extent that the Eternal Realm warriors could not resist it.</p>

  <p>He knew that it was meaningless to break the needle now, but he still had this flaming desire deep in his heart.</p>

  <p>"I'll help you fulfill your dream," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Fuxi waved his hand and said, "Forget it. If I can't do it myself, it would only be pointless..."</p>

  <p>"No. You will do it yourself."</p>

  <p>After saying that, Luo Zheng gently pointed his finger at Fuxi and massive energy started to pour into his body that made him tremble slightly.</p>

  <p>As an Eternal Realm warrior, Fuxi couldn't bear too much energy.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Zheng infused energy into Fuxi's body, he had also strengthened Fuxi's body in order to help him carry the weight of this energy.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had injected enough energy, a thought came to his mind which suddenly moved the entire Immortal Mansion a long distance to the front of the needle.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead. You can do it," said Luo Zheng in a motivating tone as he nodded to Fuxi.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had never grasped such terrifying energy before, and the feeling of possessing a wonderful abundance of energy could not be put into words.</p>

  <p>He felt as if he could easily tear anything and everything apart.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He jumped up, rising from the ground of the Immortal Mansion. His figure flickered as the winds pressed against his face, and soon landed on the head of the needle.</p>

  <p>Fuxi broke the tip of the needle and retreated a distance of ten feet. With a loud shout, he gathered the strength all over his body in his fist and released it.</p>

  <p>Compared to the huge needle, Fuxi was just a single dust particle.</p>

  <p>However, the power radiating from this dust particle had surprisingly caused the needle to shatter into pieces and collapse from its head...</p>

  <p>Clatter, clatter, clatter...</p>

  <p>In the end, the thunderous sound of the needle collapsing caught the attention of the Evil God. The Evil God used the power of omniscience to check what had happened and faintly snorted, "Why would he even waste time doing such boring and useless thing..."</p>

  <p>"Hahaha. I feel great!"</p>

  <p>When he returned to the Immortal Mansion, Fuxi looked satisfied with a wide grin. For more than one thousand past chaotic eras, he was the only one who had achieved this. He had finally fulfilled his lifelong wish.</p>

  <p>Certainly, there was nothing happier in the world.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's upbeat mood influenced the others. The originally dull atmosphere suddenly became cheerful because of him. Fuxi even took out a bottle of wine, inviting everyone to drink with him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng withdrew quietly and walked into a courtyard, sitting on a stone chair at the center instead.</p>

  <p>With a thought, he activated the omniscient power. Instantly, he saw that on the other side of the chaos, the Evil God was standing on the black ship, giving out orders to what looked like two billion brains.</p>

  <p>Because of his omniscient power, Luo Zheng also found out everything about the Evil God and what he had been doing.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had transformed the Source World into two billion brains at the Holy Soul Realm. It was indeed a crazy move!</p>

  <p>Right now, the Evil God placed his hopes on these two billion brains, expecting them to come up with a plan to stop the downgrade.</p>

  <p>"Is there really no way to stop the downgrade?" Luo Zheng asked sounding desperate.</p>

  <p>He had verified this answer from Clarence. The answer was very clear as it had been confirmed all the way from the highest-grade world.</p>

  <p>"According to past experiences, there is indeed no solution," Clarence's voice suddenly responded.</p>

  <p>"You mean something else with your words," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After a moment of silence, Clarence continued, "Experience is based on rules, but if something breaks the rules, experience will be unreliable."</p>

  <p>"Are you talking about the Evil God?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, not only him but also you," replied Clarence.</p>

  <p>When Clarence saw that the Evil God used the energies of the high-grade worlds, he realized that something strange had happened.</p>

  <p>He then pried into Luo Zheng's memories, trying to dig for answers and figure out the cause and effect.</p>

  <p>"The Evil God was born from your inner world. In fact, he is the personification of all the negative emotions in your primitive land. From this point of view, the Evil God is actually the complete opposite of you,"</p>

  <p>Clarence continued.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded as he listened closely.</p>

  <p>"Mastema and I have the same origin. He is created by me, yet I can no longer restrain him... Don't you think that your relationship with the Evil God is much like my relationship with Mastema?" Clarence added, "Your birth and the Evil God's birth couldn't be merely a coincidence."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head as he didn't think so. "There are many cases like me and the Evil God in the world."</p>

  <p>"But the Evil God can directly use the power of the high-grade worlds, which is against the basic rules," Clarence emphasized. "If I'm not mistaken, you can also use the power of the high-grade worlds."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha..." Luo Zheng chuckled with self-mockery as he said, "I can only use the Extreme Form energies with your help. I can't even understand the energies of the high-grade worlds, not to mention use them."</p>

  <p>"You will be able to understand after I give the energies to you."</p>

  <p>After saying that, Clarence injected a massive amount of memory into Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>It was the information about how the energies of the sixth-grade world, seventh-grade world, eighth-grade world till the twelfth-grade world, Field, Weight, Coupling, Cube... had all been created.</p>

  <p>The downgrader and Clarence both controlled the energies of the high-grade worlds, but after the high-grade worlds were downgraded, they could no longer do so as the basic rules restricted them.</p>

  <p>With his eyes closed, Luo Zheng digested all the memories in his mind.</p>

  <p>After a short while, Luo Zheng slowly opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>A trace of excitement then reflected in his darkened expression.</p>

  <p>He still didn't know if he could find a way to stop the downgrade. If he really stopped it from happening, a battle would definitely emerge between him and the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Relying on the Extreme Form energies alone, he would surely lose. He indeed needed to grasp the power at a higher level.</p>

  <p>"Energy... Field."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stretched out his hands and gently rubbed his two fingers as the energy started to flow slowly.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Streams of light blue energy then began to rotate, forming a perfect ring that floated in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was a brand-new energy? Field.</p>

  <p>"I... did this?" Luo Zheng stared at the ring in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Go on," Clarence urged.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then unleashed the Weight, Coupling, Cube, and other energies one after another with an unbelievably smooth process.</p>

  <p>"My judgment is right," said Clarence. "Both you and the Evil God were born by accident in this world, so you can go on and ignore the basic rules."</p>

  <p>"By accident? What do you mean?" Luo Zheng asked, looking puzzled.</p>
