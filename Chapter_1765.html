<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1765 The Cursing Power </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Sorcerers, this is the territory of the Humanity Alliance! Get out of here quickly!" The Saint Lord of the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place's voice boomed loudly. However, huge skulls suddenly appeared in the crevices.</p>

  <p>Upon closer look, some creatures with oddly-shaped bodies were scattered across the skulls' eye sockets and mouths.</p>

  <p>Aside from the skulls, there were three one-eyed Angels of Death that carried three grand sorcerers on their backs.</p>

  <p>"Cluck, cluck, cluck?" One of the grand sorcerers glanced at the Saint Lord, waved a bone cane in his hand and said in a painfully chilling voice, "Don't let even a single one of them go?"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh?"</p>

  <p>The rugged black shadows swarmed the sky like an army of locusts as they rushed towards the Saint Lord of the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>In turn, the Saint Lord extended his hand, and unsheathed the treasured sword that he held. Meanwhile, the experts of the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place also made their move.</p>

  <p>At that point, the sword energy surged in the sky over them and the light of laws shone like the sun.</p>

  <p>"There's a little boy here! Ha-ha?"</p>

  <p>Apparently, a rugged black figure had discovered Dominic, whose cultivation base was at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>However, Dominic was quite quick-witted. He stepped on a cyan lotus and turned into a streak of cyan light the moment he was discovered, in a strange attempt to escape. He knew that if he stayed there, he would only be a burden to his father.</p>

  <p>Yet, Dominic was too young. He was only thirteen years old and his cultivation base was only at the Internal Elixir Realm. Although he had his ingenious ways, a black bone spear had pierced his body before he could even take a few steps out.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place had originally not noticed his son, but because of the connection between him and Dominic through a treasure? a Life Lock, the Life Lock reacted when the spear stabbed Dominic. He quickly turned around and looked at his son.</p>

  <p>"Dominic!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha? There's no need to be sad. The entire Cyan Lotus World will be taken over, and you will die as well!"</p>

  <p>After that, the three grand sorcerers began to attack the Saint Lord together!</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord was naturally devastated at their words, but it was also at that point that he decisively took out a token? a Roaring Token!</p>

  <p>He had realized that he was powerless against the sudden appearance of the enemy.</p>

  <p>There was only one way at the moment? to pass on the news that the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place had been attacked.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord had thought that those grand sorcerers would try to stop him. To his surprise, the three grand sorcerers just smiled at him. They didn't stop him from activating the Roaring Token at all.</p>

  <p>Thus, he activated it. Several sounds then flooded his ears.</p>

  <p>"Here's the Immense Cloud World... We need assistance... The enemy is the sorcerer race! Ah..."</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Healum, the Chaos Heaven World is invaded!"</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>The Immense Cloud World was a supreme world in the Thoughtless Minds, and not in the Humanity Alliance.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Heaven World was not far from the Cyan Lotus World.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the sorcerer race had planned this war for quite a long time now, so they came prepared for the day's battle.</p>

  <p>Despair was written all over the Saint Lord's face. His long sword quivered in his hand, but his misery was soon changed into determination. As he looked at his people who were in battle against the sorcerers, he threw away the Roaring Token and rushed to the enemy without hesitation!</p>

  <p>At that moment, cries for help sounded all over the universe because at the same time the sorcerer race had invaded all the major forces' supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>It was known that a grand sorcerer was as strong as a world lord.</p>

  <p>Back then, the sorcerer race wasn't a big group. Thus, the major forces were truly shocked when the grand sorcerers who should be few in number in their opinion suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>All the forces reacted quickly when they figured out what was going on.</p>

  <p>However, because so many worlds had been invaded, it was difficult for even the grand world lords and the Supreme Lords to reverse the situation.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the Pure Jade World that was next to the Cyan Lotus World also encountered the invasion of the sorcerer race.</p>

  <p>The Pure Jade World was far more powerful compared to the Cyan Lotus World. There were four world lords in the Pure Jade Sacred Place, and three tenth-grade sacred places as well. However, they were faced with an equally strong group of sorcerers!</p>

  <p>"Everyone of the Cyan Lotus Sacred Place, evacuate!"</p>

  <p>The top brass of the sacred place now had no time to organize a retreat.</p>

  <p>Black streaks of lightning shot through the sky, and the great cracks looked as if they were going to devour the sacred place.</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the Pure Jade Sacred Place was quite powerful. As one of the best of all the world lords, he was only second to the grand world lords.</p>

  <p>Yet, he struggled to cope with the siege of several grand sorcerers.</p>

  <p>"Come with me!" Preston shouted.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie then ran after Preston, her ears filled with cries for help from the Roaring Tokens. She was clearly terrified.</p>

  <p>"How did this happen..." she asked, her face grim. "A crisis has come,"</p>

  <p>Preston stated in a cool voice.</p>

  <p>"In theory, it won't be so fast!"</p>

  <p>Since the Illusion Battlefield had just closed, there should be at least a buffer period of decades or even hundreds of years; but now the crisis came after only half a month. Why did it come so soon? Preston couldn't figure it out. Besides, was the sorcerer race responsible for this universal crisis?</p>

  <p>What he did not know was that the sorcerer race was only the catalyst, and the real, much worse crisis was yet to come.</p>

  <p>"Will Luo Luo Zheng be safe?" Ning Yudie asked. The first person she thought of amidst the chaos was Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"He is the man who can solve this crisis! So don't worry. He's not going to die that easily," Preston said as a black bolt of lightning fell across the sky. "Boom!" a huge pit suddenly appeared in front of them with a loud bang, which contained the bulk of a skull. Then, some craggy-looking figures crawled out of it.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Preston reached out his hand and made a beat, from which a strange vibration had spread out.</p>

  <p>His move was a high layer skill of the Space Law. Two forces which constantly shook each other in the same space could cause terrible damage!</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack..."</p>

  <p>Cracks quickly appeared on the black figures' bodies, and then they turned into black powder on the ground.</p>

  <p>However, the black powders suddenly moved again and turned into fist-sized skulls. Then they hurled themselves at Preston!</p>

  <p>Preston launched another attack. However great the shock was, it could not damage those small skulls at all!</p>

  <p>The skulls swarmed over Preston to bite his back. Their white teeth gnawed at Preston's body-protecting life vitality. It was the sorcerer race's curse!</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>Preston had no time to care about anything else. The Saint Lord had ordered him to protect Ning Yudie, so he had to take her to safety.</p>

  <p>The two ran and ran through the sacred place until they reached an underground palace. Core disciples of the Pure Jade Sacred Palace entered with them as well.</p>

  <p>They were fortunate enough to have escaped to the underground palace, which was a sanctuary built by the Pure Jade Sacred Place? for now.</p>
