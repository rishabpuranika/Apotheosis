<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It had been a mistake to assume that they would be able to pass through the abyss safely by just throwing the dice. Everyone had greatly underestimated the situation they were all in.</p>

  <p>The fate of the Mysterious Luna Hall's elder was a clear wake-up call for all of them present. Passing through the abyss wasn't to be taken lightly.</p>

  <p>The disks served as deadly traps that might come out at any time and cost them their lives.</p>

  <p>The Blazing Thunder Prison that had appeared earlier had been so powerful that even a Life and Death Realm master wouldn't have the confidence to resist it.</p>

  <p>It was a game of chance. As the beam of light continued spinning, several more people threw the dice and walked further towards the abyss.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, none encountered the Blazing Thunder Prison.</p>

  <p>A few more made the gamble. Someone got the number one, and another got the number five. Soon enough, the beam of light pointed at Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie shot the dice with a hit from her palm, watching as it rolled on the floor and stopped at the number four.</p>

  <p>Four disks suddenly appeared in front of her: three were transparent while the fourth was a rich, emerald green.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the emerald green disk made her hesitate. Just now, the Mysterious Luna Hall elder had stepped onto the fiery red disk, triggering the Blazing Thunder Prison. Who knew what was behind the emerald disk in front of her?</p>

  <p>However, opportunity was always accompanied with risks. Ning Yudie took a step and steeled herself - there was no way back.</p>

  <p>The moment she stepped onto the emerald green disk, a voice echoed all throughout.</p>

  <p>"Light of longevity. You are rewarded an extra 500 years of lifespan," it said as green light shot out from the disk and enveloped Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Reward?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng murmured with astonishment.</p>

  <p>The realization hit everyone hard and their eyes were then filled with green envy.</p>

  <p>After the violent punishment of Blazing Thunder Prison earlier, nobody would've thought that the emerald disk that had presented itself in front of Ning Yudie would contain such a generous reward!</p>

  <p>Five hundred years of lifespan!</p>

  <p>There were many ways to increase one's lifespan in the Sky Northern Region such as Life Extension Pills and Long Life Pills.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, extending one's life this way was not so easy nor simple. The pills were extremely valuable and had limited effects. The Life Extension Pill, for example, could only be taken once to extend a person's life for mere three years. Any further intake of the pill after that would have no further effect. The Long Life Pill, on the other hand, could extend one's life for 20 more years but it came with a heavy side-effect. The pill contained an incurable poison that, once ingested, would permanently prevent the warrior from advancing their strength.</p>

  <p>Only warriors who were desperate and at the end of their lifespan would dare take the Long Life Pill just so they would be able to linger on the earth for a bit longer. To gain extra years, one always had to trade in something else.</p>

  <p>However, here was Ning Yudie who, after a mere roll of the dice, was suddenly able to win five hundred years of lifespan. As a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior, she already had a lifespan of one thousand years. Now, with an additional five hundred, she wouldn't have any difficulty living up to two thousand years.</p>

  <p>Who wouldn't be jealous?</p>

  <p>"The leader of Cloud Hall has such good luck!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, luck is somehow always on Cloud Hall's side. Luo Zheng is a case in point.</p>

  <p>If Cloud Hall doesn't intend to rule the Central Region and establish the divine kingdom, it is very likely that it will be promoted to a sacred place in the future!"</p>

  <p>"Isn't Cloud Hall only a fourth-grade sect?"</p>

  <p>"Fourth grade?"</p>

  <p>There was a cackling laugh, "The Cloud Hall has always been at the top among all fourth-grade sects. In fact, once Ning Yudie recovers her level of Virtual Tribulation Realm, the Cloud Hall would be able to become a quasi-fifth grade sect." "Don't they now have a sect-protecting array that can kill Life and Death Realm masters? With such amazing strength, isn't Cloud Hall already a fifth-grade sect?!"</p>

  <p>The conversation was lively and a lot of the warriors were intent on getting their say with regards to their opinions on Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie on the other hand was glowing with joy as soon as the green light disappeared, "Congratulations to the leader of Cloud Hall for having such good fortune," the Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie returned his good nature. "Thank you," she said with a soft voice.</p>

  <p>She then glanced at Luo Zheng. In truth, he was the first person she looked at as soon as she heard the announcement.</p>

  <p>With only steps away from each other, she had expected him to praise her good luck but that wasn't what she heard when he suddenly came over,</p>

  <p>"Five hundred years of lifespan! Tia, I really want to know how old you are now."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie only replied with a scathing glare.</p>

  <p>Realizing that the disks not only contained punishment but also had the potential for great rewards, the warriors easily became excited.</p>

  <p>For warriors, danger was nothing strange to them. However, danger was often followed by opportunity. Whether or not you obtained this opportunity would be highly dependent on your luck, strength, and perseverance. This was how they all saw the world from the moment that they stepped onto the path of martial arts.</p>

  <p>The Blazing Thunder Prison had been terrifying but the opportunity was even more tempting.</p>

  <p>After Ning Yudie, the beam finally landed on Eddie. Stretching a finger, Eddie lightly snapped it towards the dice and watched as it showed a "5." Five disks then appeared in front of Eddie with the final disk the color of pitch black.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the black disk filled Eddie with a heavy sense of foreboding.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, felt his heartbeat racing. Black was often a color for something ominous. This disk might carry a terrifying punishment that could kill Eddie.</p>

  <p>'This is an opportunity!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Although he had no idea where Eddie had hidden Yan or how he treated her, as long as he was out of the picture, there was already a huge possibility of him getting his sister back. Alongside the influence Cloud Hall had, no one in Central Region would dare capture Yan and he'd be able to take her back. The Ethereal Spirit Sect and the World Commercial Alliance would not intervene in this matter.</p>

  <p>Eddie snorted but took five steps forward nonetheless.</p>

  <p>"Black Illusion."</p>

  <p>As soon as the voice was heard, a black orb burst forth and enveloped Eddie with a black mist. Everyone could see the mist form into all kinds of phantoms.</p>

  <p>"This illusion is so powerful! Those phantoms are actually ones of the legendary beasts!"</p>

  <p>"Can Eddie even survive this? I highly doubt it!"</p>

  <p>"It's good if he dies. If he lives, he will only become a nightmare for the warriors of the Central Region in the future."</p>

  <p>Eddie was both evil and righteous in his way of doing things which made a lot of people wary of him. The only reason why they kept silent was that he was too strong and nobody in Central Region could be his match. Truth be told, many of them were also wishing for the same thing as Luo Zheng, and Owen, and even those from the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>They all hoped for Eddie's death.</p>

  <p>"HA!"</p>

  <p>An incredible wave of power burst through the black mist as they all heard Eddie's roar.</p>

  <p>The power had been so strong that it was able to escape the Black Illusion and be felt by the warriors that were standing nearby. A few even had to stagger back from the momentum. Such was Eddie's strength.</p>

  <p>"I never thought that the Sky Northern Region had such a strong master!" the handsome man from the divine kingdom murmured in an indifferent, almost mocking tone.</p>

  <p>The woman in black beside him remained expressionless. "They're still ants," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>As Eddie let out his roar, the phantoms of the various legendary beasts started to flicker. At this time, a lot of warriors heard violent noises coming from the black mist as if Eddie was fighting against some extremely powerful beings.</p>

  <p>Gradually, the phantoms started to disappear one by one, along with the Black Illusion. Once the mist had dissipated, Eddie was revealed, standing firmly on the disk with an expressionless face.</p>

  <p>There were numerous gasps all around. "Eddie has survived!"</p>

  <p>"He's too powerful! The Black Illusion is probably some kind of extremely powerful magic killing array but he was able to break through it just like that."</p>

  <p>"He truly lives up to the name of top master in the Eastern Region."</p>

  <p>Everyone was awed by Eddie's strength but it was only Eddie himself who knew what kind of crisis he had just encountered. All sorts of legendary beasts had appeared within the Black Illusion and attacked him all at once.</p>

  <p>Although the strength of these legendary beasts couldn't compare to the real thing, Eddie's strength had been greatly suppressed and had been equal to that of the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm instead of his Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>He had to use a lot of cultivation methods to kill the legendary beasts one by one and the fight almost exhausted all of his skills before he managed to come out of the Black Illusion alive.</p>

  <p>After his trial, the beam of light once again moved, now stopping at the woman in black from the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>It was unknown to all what kind of cultivation method she had mastered.</p>

  <p>The woman only shot an indifferent glance at the dice before it began to spin, as if pushed forward by her looks alone.</p>

  <p>Soon, the dice gave a "6."</p>

  <p>The woman only looked at the number and calmly walked forward once the six disks appeared in front of her. The sixth disk was a bright yellow color this time.</p>

  <p>As soon as she stepped onto the yellow disk, the voice suddenly spoke,</p>

  <p>"Throw the dice again."</p>

  <p>The woman in black faintly smiled, but the crowd was stunned. They all wondered why she had been treated differently and was not made to face any punishment or reward.</p>
