<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1622 Illusion Of Killing Sword Mountain </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was always a limit to the level of power that one could reach in the universe.</p>

  <p>For example, when one trained in the Fire Law, the highest level one could reach was the tenth level.</p>

  <p>However, Soul Sea Realm warriors could only cultivate up to the fifth level, Spirit Supreme Realm warriors up to the sixth level, Spirit Transformation Realm warriors up to the seventh level, world lords up to the eighth level, and Supreme Lords up to the ninth level.</p>

  <p>This was the power of the limit. It was difficult to cross it.</p>

  <p>There were still some Supreme Lords who had taken on the Heavenly Destiny of the Fire Law. They could cultivate the Fire Law to the top level - the tenth level.</p>

  <p>Reaching this top stage meant that someone had reached perfection under this round of the heavens. But this wasn't the true uppermost level.</p>

  <p>There were levels even higher than the tenth level. But the tenth level was one that most creatures in the universe couldn't even understand, leave alone aim to touch.</p>

  <p>To reach higher levels, one had to transcend this round of the heavens and become a True God.</p>

  <p>And not everyone could become a True God.</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower floating above the heads of many warriors directly hinted at the possibility of their crossing the heavens.</p>

  <p>Each warrior trained in a different Godly Way.</p>

  <p>There were the Five Elements Godly Way, the Snow Godly Way and so on.</p>

  <p>"If I'm not mistaken, you've trained in the Emotion Closing Godly Way,"</p>

  <p>Reggie said, studying Luo Zheng closely.</p>

  <p>"Emotion Closing... That's a kind of Godly Way?" Luo Zheng asked, mildly surprised.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had known a little about the essence of the Emotion Closing Godly Way, which was why he had been able to launch such an effective Gods-intimidating Strike. What he didn't know was that Emotion Closing was also a Godly Way. He had thought this to be just another method that he had comprehended from the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>"Yes. The Emotion Closing Godly Way is an extremely powerful Godly Way. But at the same time, it is also forbidden," Reggie said. He paused for a second before continuing, "If you really succeed in cultivating this way, it will incite the gods into a fury that will burn you. It is not advisable."</p>

  <p>Reggie looked fierce and powerful - a character who wasn't afraid of anyone in the universe. His craziness had given birth to the domineering Mu Ning he carried with him where he went and was why he had gained enlightenment and stepped into the Domineering Godly Way.</p>

  <p>But he was visibly cautious when he mentioned the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said, his eyes flickering.</p>

  <p>Zheng's personality was completely different from Reggie's. He wasn't as arrogant as Reggie, but Zheng's warrior spirit was way tougher and way more resilient than Reggie's.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng would think about it carefully, now that a True God had advised him, but he knew that words couldn't change his original intention.</p>

  <p>Reggie could vaguely see what Luo Zheng was thinking. He laughed heartily and waved the large saber in his hand, saying, "That is all I want to say.</p>

  <p>You may go now."</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The lone city, the battlefield, and the ogre army that was lying prostrate on the ground, all suddenly vanished, and Luo Zheng returned again to the Corridor of Emperor.</p>

  <p>In the flame dancing on the torch, Reggie's soul mark continued to ponder as he watched Zheng's figure disappeared into the distance.</p>

  <p>"This person has no destiny.</p>

  <p>How could it be that a warrior without destiny has trained in the Emotion Closing Godly Way?</p>

  <p>It's not right. Without a destiny, he isn't a true person. His fate might have been hidden by someone using great theurgy.</p>

  <p>But what is their true purpose?".</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not know that Reggie was still thinking about him after he left.</p>

  <p>He strolled along the long corridor and continued to study the murals on both sides.</p>

  <p>Some murals recorded Reggie's life.</p>

  <p>He was also one of the most unusual among the ogre warriors and had lived an extremely difficult life. He had been rejected by the ogres.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, he had returned to them while they were in danger and had saved their lives by himself. All of this was recorded in the murals.</p>

  <p>Zheng's experience in the illusion was also related to one of the murals.</p>

  <p>Reggie had really used his strength to guard a lone city, and had fought tens of thousands of ogre warriors alone. He had guarded the city for three years!</p>

  <p>"It is no coincidence that this man became a True God. Other people might have relied on luck, but this man's luck is poor. To be able to achieve such a feat is truly admirable!" Luo Zheng sighed with emotion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't reject all of the ogre warriors even though he hadn't encountered many good people among them. The people of this race, however, always had their own way of doing things.</p>

  <p>As he continued moving forward, another torch appeared in the corridor ahead.</p>

  <p>The third True God, the God of Divine Might!</p>

  <p>He had been born six grand eras earlier and had stepped into the Godly Way through the martial arts he himself had created. As one round of the heavens after another was destroyed and revived, history had forgotten even the True Gods.</p>

  <p>The fourth True God, following the Killing Godly Way, was born three grand eras ago and was a supreme warrior of the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>The fifth True God!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked further and further along the Corridor of Emperor.</p>

  <p>He could feel the determination and characteristics of these true Gods as they stepped into the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the goals and the personalities of these true Gods are completely different. But they all have hearts that seek to push and even surpass limits!</p>

  <p>And it's only because of this perseverance that they were able to surpass the heavens.</p>

  <p>I... I won't give up."</p>

  <p>It was just as Reggie had predicted - the Emotion Closing Godly Way was not Zheng's best choice. But since he had walked this way, Luo Zheng was determined not to have any regrets.</p>

  <p>The sixth True God�</p>

  <p>The seventh True God�</p>

  <p>The further in he went, the more intense the Mu Ning of the Corridor of Emperor became.</p>

  <p>True Gods were divided into the strong and the weak.</p>

  <p>It was possible to deduce their true strength from their auras.</p>

  <p>The further the True God was placed, the more powerful he would be, and the more difficult this trial would be.</p>

  <p>But in the end, no Godly Way was suitable for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The eighth...</p>

  <p>The ninth...</p>

  <p>The tenth!</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze was fixed on the flame in front of him.</p>

  <p>As the flame flickered and swayed swiftly, Luo Zheng felt a familiar feeling emerging from the soul within the flame.</p>

  <p>"This flame," Luo Zheng murmured.</p>

  <p>And without thinking, Luo Zheng took another step forward.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The flame exploded once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng opened his eyes, looking surprised.</p>

  <p>A mountain full of numerous swords had appeared before him.</p>

  <p>The... The Killing Sword Mountain!</p>

  <p>Back when Luo Zheng had comprehended the consummate sword intent, he had entered the Killing Sword Mountain once.</p>

  <p>He never would have thought that he would be able to return to the Killing Sword Mountain again, let alone in this flame.</p>

  <p>'No, this isn't the real Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>It is just an environment that the intellectual soul mark has created, ' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had observed the Corridor of Emperor very carefully.</p>

  <p>The illusions created by the soul marks of these True Gods were scenes in the universe that had left the deepest impressions on them.</p>

  <p>Reggie guarding the lone city and Hannah in the world of snow and ice were likely the most valuable memories for these true Gods, and also the scenes that the universe couldn't forget.</p>

  <p>The Killing Sword Mountain!</p>

  <p>It had appeared during this grand era.</p>

  <p>As to the one who might have left an indelible mark on the Killing Sword Mountain...</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sword!</p>

  <p>The name occurred to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sword had left behind a poem in the Orange Sea World, with which he had merged the pinnacle of his comprehension of the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>And it was said that this Supreme Lord was already missing.</p>

  <p>If he had died, his Heavenly Destiny would dissipate and turn into a new Crown of Destiny again.</p>

  <p>This obviously meant that the Supreme Lord Sword wasn't dead yet.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng could see the Killing Sword Mountain here, did it mean that Supreme Lord Sword had become a True God? Had he become a True God through the Emotion Closing Godly Way?</p>

  <p>Of course, this was merely Zheng's speculation. There were probably other figures in the Killing Sword Mountain who had managed to become True Gods, and they might not be Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt that this was the most likely possibility.</p>

  <p>Standing at the foot of the mountain, Luo Zheng looked up and spotted a faint figure standing at the peak of the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Alright," Luo Zheng murmured, letting out a huff as if preparing himself. "I will climb to the top and figure it out!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng would try to pass this test regardless of whether or not this person was Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng advanced, a long sword rose from the ground and shot towards him.</p>

  <p>Only a mysterious weapon.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stretched out two fingers and held the tip of the sword in place. The mysterious weapon could not move. Then, with a light shake of Zheng's wrist, the mysterious weapon lost its spirituality.</p>

  <p>He held the now ordinary long sword in his hand and walked slowly up the mountain.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng had first climbed up the Killing Sword Mountain, every step he had taken had been a shock. Now, it was as if he had stepped into a danger-free zone. The long swords rose from the ground and shot towards him, one after another. Luo Zheng merely had to wave his hand, like brushing away stray twigs, to keep them off him.</p>

  <p>But even though it was just an illusion and not the real Killing Sword Mountain, Luo Zheng was deeply moved, now that he had been forced to revisit it.</p>
