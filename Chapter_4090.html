  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as the Monkey Spirit King realized what happened to him, he began to struggle like mad in the dream.</p>

  <p>He did not wake up, but it didn't mean that he could not do anything.</p>

  <p>Then again, he always had a violent reaction every time a wolf tooth appeared, and there were thirteen wolf teeth in total this time.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, his struggles happened in a chaotic state.</p>

  <p>He could not effectively control his body, so it only affected Sewell's control.</p>

  <p>This also made his Treacherous Being body seem strange and contradictory.</p>

  <p>Many races on the Night View Island got affected.</p>

  <p>But as the commotion grew increasingly louder, more and more creatures noticed the mountain-like body. In a split second, they all left their territories and fled everywhere.</p>

  <p>As for Sewell, his brows knitted in seriousness.</p>

  <p>He tried his best to steer the Monkey Spirit King in the right direction as they stumbled towards the passageway of the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King's struggle was only a hindrance, but he could still get subdued at any time.</p>

  <p>He moved bit by bit, as he rolled and jumped.</p>

  <p>And every time the Monkey Masters approached, Sewell always took advantage of his powers to slap them away one by one.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>At that moment, Claire and Gavyn, who had been waiting outside, quickly went near.</p>

  <p>The two of them didn't expect such an accident to happen either. However, since the Eye Spirit had completed his task, they had to run away with him no matter what.</p>

  <p>As the Monkey Spirit King acted like a crazed demon, both of them did not dare approach him, but instead, they followed him from a nearby distance.</p>

  <p>Of course, Claire had also discovered Luo Zheng on the other side.</p>

  <p>There were dozens of people around him, including four Great Ghost Priests.</p>

  <p>They felt quite lucky since Luo Zheng did not make any trouble for them.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they did not do anything to provoke him.</p>

  <p>"The Monkey Spirit King is getting close to the exit in the middle of the lake," said Zhurong.</p>

  <p>"We can't interfere. When they take the Monkey Spirit King away, we will also leave secretly," Emperor Di Jun said firmly.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>That was because they were thinking about a more pressing problem.</p>

  <p>It was also an issue that had existed from the 77th chaos, until now.</p>

  <p>It was the question of how to fight against the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Nihility race, which was led by the Grandmaster of Heaven, was also their enemy now.</p>

  <p>The Four Spirits Sect supported those two races.</p>

  <p>With such strong forces, how could the human race fight them?</p>

  <p>The Human Spirit Sect?</p>

  <p>Yet, the memories of the energy souls that came out of Luo Zheng's body told them clearly that the Human Spirit Sect seemed to be on the side of the Element Spirit Civilization!</p>

  <p>Some of the human heroes remained slightly impassive, but the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess felt very disappointed.</p>

  <p>They had stayed in the Ghost Mountain for so many years. Through frequent contact with the Monkey Masters, they knew about the structure of the Four Spirits Sect, albeit sporadically. At the same time, they also knew that there was a Human Spirit Sect in the Four Spirits Sect that belonged to the human race.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the real Snake Goddess had always had a kind of expectation, as they hoped that one day, the Human Spirit Sect would appear and fully support them.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed like a faraway dream.</p>

  <p>If they could awaken the Monkey Spirit King, perhaps they could persuade him to let the Monkey Spirit Sect support the human race.</p>

  <p>Alas, the Element Spirit Civilization would take the Monkey Spirit King away now.</p>

  <p>What was worse was that they could not do anything but watch.</p>

  <p>Even the unimaginably strong and powerful Monkey Masters were slapped away by the Monkey Spirit King, let alone these people.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Loud slaps filled the air as three more Monkey Masters got hit and sent flying away.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King's punch was so powerful that it pushed those three Monkey Masters straight out of the Night View Island's territorial boundary.</p>

  <p>Sizzle, sizzle, Sizzle...</p>

  <p>Then, the invisible little bugs devoured them and they disappeared in the Void Dust.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings could be revived infinitely, but the human race did not have the ability to do so.</p>

  <p>While the Primeval Lord of Heaven hesitantly weighed his thoughts, Luo Zheng suddenly said, "No, we have to stop the Monkey Spirit King. We need his help!"</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun looked at Luo Zheng in disbelief and asked, "Stop him? How do we stop him?"</p>

  <p>These human heroes were highly intelligent. Although they did not think too much about it, they immediately understood Luo Zheng's intention.</p>

  <p>However, none of the Monkey Masters could stop him, let alone them.</p>

  <p>"We just need to break the Thirteen Teeth Necklace," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing what he just said, everyone paid attention to the Monkey Spirit King's chest.</p>

  <p>The Thirteen Teeth Necklace dangled around his neck by a tri-colored rope, and the end of the rope went into the back of his head.</p>

  <p>"But I'm afraid we're not strong enough... Our efforts might get wasted,"</p>

  <p>Chiyou said and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The hatred-level Treacherous Being is indeed quite strong, but that is still too weak for them," Zhurong agreed.</p>

  <p>The four human Great Ghost Priests had merged with four hatred-level Treacherous Beings. When it came to strength, they were considered the best among the human heroes.</p>

  <p>Therefore, everyone took the fact that they could always rely on them for granted.</p>

  <p>"I have another idea. Why not use the Other Shore Tokens?" Luo Zheng suggested.</p>

  <p>In turn, the human heroes were stunned.</p>

  <p>Before they fused with the Treacherous Beings, they relied hugely on two things: their bloodlines and the Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Treacherous Being and the bloodline, the Other Shore Token was much more powerful and terrifying, and it was also changeable.</p>

  <p>But after they had stayed in the Ghost Mountain for so long, they kind of forgot about the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess perked up in anticipation.</p>

  <p>Everyone present had the Other Shore Tokens from the Supreme Pure Realm and even the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>Although these Other Shore Tokens were not as powerful as the ones they had when human beings were in their prime, their combined strengths were still fatal.</p>

  <p>"I can help! I can help anyone get close to the Monkey Spirit King!"</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun exclaimed.</p>

  <p>With a slight shake of his shoulders, a pair of transparent wings emerged behind him.</p>

  <p>The transparent wings seemed to be made of diamonds, as their entire crystalline structure shone brightly.</p>

  <p>They were the Swift Bird's wings.</p>

  <p>This kind of bird was from the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>It was known for flying so fast that no one could catch it. The moment anyone approached it, it quickly disappeared.</p>

  <p>It was also impossible to measure the timespan when the bird moved from one place to another. Thus, it disappeared so suddenly, and that was why it was called the Swift Bird.</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, the bird used a type of space traveling skill, but it had already made full use of space.</p>

  <p>Its only disadvantage was that it took a few days to recover once it had used its wings.</p>

  <p>To capture the Swift Bird, one had to force it to use its ability once, before they could catch it.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go by yourself?" Houyi glared at Emperor Di Jun. He had been silent all this time, and now he spoke up.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid of death," Emperor Di Jun replied.</p>

  <p>"Send me there," the real Snake Goddess prompted.</p>

  <p>"No! Let me do it!" Chiyou interjected with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>"Stop arguing," said the real Fuxi, who stood in front of the crowd. Then he shouted, "Let me do it!"</p>

  <p>Just then, a pair of black scissors appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>They were called the Sand Life Scissors.</p>

  <p>Although it was only an Other Shore Token from the Supreme Pure Realm, it could directly cut off space.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that I have a Resurrection Egg," he added.</p>

  <p>His Resurrection Egg was very rare and had a pretty simple ability. It could make the real Fuxi have two lives.</p>

  <p>But even though so many chaotic eras had passed, the real Fuxi never had the chance to use it. Now was the right time for him to take a risk.</p>
