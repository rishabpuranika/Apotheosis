<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2360 The Heavenly Wheel Snake </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>There was some information withheld by the Eagle race in the beginning.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Zheng saved their Royal Eagle and was treated like an esteemed guest, he remained an outsider to their race.</p>

  <p>However, completely rebirthing the Royal Eagle's wing by means of a pill was completely taking it to a whole other level.</p>

  <p>To say the chief was excited was an understatement.</p>

  <p>It was amazing just how Zheng kept on surprising them. The young man actually had a pill that could save a disabled Royal Eagle. One could only wonder how many more magic pills he had in his possession.</p>

  <p>The chief didn't know where Zheng came from, but it didn't really matter. If the young man wasn't strong enough, then those pills were as good as the chief's.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng was already aware of the chief's intentions.</p>

  <p>On hand, he still had around seven or eight five times refined pills. If the members of the Eagle race wanted to snatch them by force, then the price they would have to pay would definitely be higher than the harvest.</p>

  <p>Zheng was no fool. He had already made inquiries and understood how this world worked more clearly.</p>

  <p>This world had three great races.</p>

  <p>The Eagle race was one of them, then the Roc race, and finally, the Swallow race. The golden rocs Zheng had seen previously belonged to the Roc race.</p>

  <p>These three races lived through the birds they tamed and they flourished around the vast desert.</p>

  <p>"Is it caused by those bugs?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The chief nodded. "Yes. Our eagles take the Heavenly Wheel Bugs as their meal so they can grow healthy and strong."</p>

  <p>'So those strange bugs are called Heavenly Wheel Bugs, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Every once in a while, the Eagle race would take their eagles out into the desert to graze and have their fill of Heavenly Wheel Bugs. It was there that Zheng met them.</p>

  <p>The golden rocs had the same agenda and thus fought with the eagles.</p>

  <p>This had been going on for so long that each race always treated the others with animosity at sight.</p>

  <p>It was this desert that comprised the center of this world. Incidentally, a consummate True God of the Sword Clan also died there.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Zheng asked again, "Are there some special places in this world? Or has anyone ever seen something similar to a jade seal?"</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know how to control the jade seal or how the world was like, so he had no choice but to explore bit by bit to find out.</p>

  <p>"What is a jade seal?" the chief asked in apparent confusion.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled. It seemed there was no such thing as a jade seal in this race.</p>

  <p>He thought it was better to show rather than tell. Breaking a leg off one of the tables, Zheng used his finger to carve it.</p>

  <p>A carving of a small snake blossomed onto the wood and underneath it was the jade seal.</p>

  <p>Nelly, who sat beside Zheng, was quite confused. She did not understand the conversation between him and the chief or what Zheng was planning to do.</p>

  <p>However, as the wood was continuously carved, the light in Nelly's eyes also flashed. 'So it's the jade seal. He wants to find a way to control the world, ' she thought.</p>

  <p>Nelly also did not generally know what went on with the world, but she had learned and built up an assumption about it. The world was most likely a space built by the jade seal and one had to find a way to control it.</p>

  <p>After finishing the carving, Zheng heaved a sigh of relief. He then put it on the table. "Have you ever seen this thing before?" he asked the chief.</p>

  <p>The wooden carving looked very lifelike and the chief couldn't help but be surprised by it.</p>

  <p>He narrowed his eyes and a few members of the Eagle race looked at it with grave expressions.</p>

  <p>Their reactions pleased Zheng for a bit. It seemed he asked the right person.</p>

  <p>Although she couldn't understand what they were talking about, Nelly could very clearly see the expressions on these people's faces and that they recognized the wooden carving.</p>

  <p>"I know the snake," the chief replied after a brief pause.</p>

  <p>"Where is it?" Zheng asked with raised eyebrows.</p>

  <p>At that moment, however, the chief hesitated. He seemed to be deep in thought for a bit before sighing. "This is the Heavenly Wheel Snake in the Heavenly Wheel Temple. We go to the desert every once in a while and bring a few boys and girls there as sacrifices to the Heavenly Wheel Snake. This is how we protect our race from punishment."</p>

  <p>His words cast a depressing mood in the room.</p>

  <p>Offering up sacrifices to the Heavenly Wheel Snake was a serious affair and ensured peace to their race.</p>

  <p>However, this practice was met with reluctance.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the desert, the Heavenly Wheel Snake controlled the entire desert's Heavenly Wheel Bugs. To satiate the Heavenly Wheel Snake, children would be sent into the temple.</p>

  <p>The fate of these sacrifices was evident. Nobody who entered that place ever came out.</p>

  <p>No race was willing to send their own children, but it was a necessity.</p>

  <p>Each race sent it as many as they could. If the Roc race sent ten, then the Eagle race would send a few more.</p>

  <p>If the number of children sent in wasn't enough, then the Heavenly Wheel Snake would punish the race.</p>

  <p>There were countless Heavenly Wheel Bugs. If the Heavenly Wheel Snake willed it, a wave of several hundred large Heavenly Wheel Bugs could come and ravage the Eagle Castle instantly. Whatever the Heavenly Wheel Snake willed would be done.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in understanding. "So that's how it is."</p>

  <p>The people of this world could only survive with the help of their birds, but in order to do that, the birds needed to eat the Heavenly Wheel Bugs.</p>

  <p>And the humans must send in their children to the Heavenly Wheel Snake. Otherwise, the snake would destroy them. It was a cycle. The humans in this world lived in order to raise that snake!</p>

  <p>It seemed the Heavenly Wheel Snake would probably be the key to controlling the jade seal.</p>

  <p>"When do you offer up sacrifices to the Heavenly Wheel Snake?" Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>"It depends. Sometimes once in half a year, other times once a month," the chief said.</p>

  <p>Everyone else was silent and some of the members even looked sad.</p>

  <p>Over the years, their children had been sent to the Heavenly Wheel Temple to die. Zheng's question uncovered old wounds that never really healed.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," Zheng apologized in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The chief sighed. "We've gotten used to it after so many years." He then pointed at the wooden carving Zheng made. "The Heavenly Wheel Snake cannot be offended. We have to sacrifice our children for us to live in peace. My poor daughter will be sent to the Heavenly Wheel Temper in half a month."</p>

  <p>A trace of sadness appeared on his face at the mention of his child.</p>

  <p>His daughter was only six-year-old and did not yet quite understand what the elders were talking about. All she had been doing so far was sit next to her father and enjoy her meal.</p>

  <p>When she heard him mention her, she smiled brightly at him.</p>

  <p>"In half a month?" Zheng repeated in surprise.</p>

  <p>The chief could only nod sadly. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"May I take part in it?" Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>The chief looked up at Zheng in surprise, but a look of vigilance immediately replaced his shocked expression.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng helped in curing one of their Royal Eagles, they still did not trust in him fully. They did not know the origins of him and the woman beside him. Whether in dress or in aura, it was obvious that the two did not belong to this world.</p>

  <p id="top_1">This small world they lived in formed their narrow views. None of them cared about the truths of the world. All they really cared about was their survival.</p>

  <p>Zheng could read the chief's thoughts on his face. It seemed that his request was about to be rejected, so he quietly took out six five times refined pills from his space ring.</p>
