  <p>
</p>

  <p>The way in which Evan had showed up abruptly was so peculiar and at the same, laughably stupid, that the over one hundred thousand audiences on site were dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>Since he could fly in the sky, it was reasonable to believe that his strength was at least above the level of Illuminating Soul Realm. And being able to step into the level of Illuminating Soul Realm was adequate to show that his talents were by no means weak or limited. If so, the audience was bewildered as to why he acted like an idiot just now?</p>

  <p>"Who is this idiot on earth?" Finally, one of the disciples couldn't help it and burst out due to strong confusion.</p>

  <p>"Hush, keep it down. Don't call him names. Didn't you see Patrick was respectful to him just now? If my guess is right, he is the famous Evan Li. He is more powerful than Patrick!" another disciple scolded in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Isn't he supposed to be practicing martial arts in his secret chamber these days? What's he doing here? Has he finished practicing and come out already? Hang on. That might also mean that the All Peaks Competition's not finished yet?" the former disciple asked, now looking pretty excited.</p>

  <p>After the disciples had witnessed that Luo Luo Zheng had defeated Patrick, or rather, Patrick had admitted defeat, they had begun waiting for one of the elders to announce the rankings and changes of the entire Cloud Sect List. Not in their farthest dreams had they expected the famous Evan would show up abruptly at the end of the competition.</p>

  <p>Now they became thrilled and began to look forward to the stunning competition which might take place between Luo Luo Zheng and Evan if they agreed.</p>

  <p>After all, a hundred thousand disciples of Cloud Sect had each spent a point, which equaled to two cubic crystals as well as the whole asset of an ordinary family in an ordinary county to come and watch the competition on site. They wouldn't have wanted it to end just like that!</p>

  <p>Yet, seeing Evan's behavior which was much like a dumb person, the members of the audience were worried whether the competition would ever start or not.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Patrick! Look at you so gloomy. You look like a dead fish. Did you just lose?" Evan asked with a stupid smile on his face. He always behaved like an arrogant sod and would have said anything he wanted to, completely ignorant of others' feelings.</p>

  <p>Patrick was used to that. He simply nodded and replied, "My strength is not as good as that of Luo Luo Zheng. So, my failure is just how it has to be."</p>

  <p>Although he talked to Evan in a seemingly respectful way, he really did not want to say too many words to him anymore. Whenever and wherever Evan showed up, he sure as hell also brought endless trouble with his stupid personality. It was infuriating.</p>

  <p>Evan, though looking like an idiot, was not easy to be fooled around and obviously, wouldn't stop asking until he got a satisfying answer. He then went up and put his arm on Patrick's shoulder and asked, beaming,</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by 'just how it has to be'? I am sure that you are upset and don't want to accept it as the final result, right? I detect that the strength of your opponent over there is only at the second grade of nature level! Losing to him? Oh, Patrick, you humiliate me! You should be embarrassed too. Would you like me to win your honor back? I am telling you, I can beat the shit out of him just like that."</p>

  <p>"No, thank you. Evan, I attend the All Peaks Competition just for learning from other competitors, not to incur hatred?" Patrick replied quickly with a heavy face. Yes, he was right? he didn't know how to deal with Evan's unruly and teasing manner.</p>

  <p>"I think it's still necessary for me to win your honor back! Let's just say that's the way 'it has to be', shall we? As for the reward, I will not ask for too much. How about printing several books about the basic Buddhist cultivation methods you have figured out and giving them to me as a reward, deal?" Evan burst out in laughter on hearing his own words.</p>

  <p>'What the hell?' Patrick roared silently deep inside. Yet, he just refused calmly, "No, thank you. Evan, I still have some other business to handle right now..."</p>

  <p>Just as Evan and Patrick were having the conversation, the elder who was in charge of announcing the rankings asked him, "Evan, did you make another breakthrough during the practice in your secret chamber?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I made three breakthroughs in a row, jumping from the third grade to the sixth grade of Illuminating Soul Realm straight." Evan replied, stretching and yawning. It was almost as if improving his level was as simple and natural as eating and sleeping. He was an arrogant yet powerful personality indeed.</p>

  <p>There were some ancient treasures, such as super well-refined pills, which could help warriors in making quick breakthroughs in the Illuminating Soul Realm. However, this kind of well-refined pills was very rare in the Eastern Region. Most of the pills refined by Eastern Region alchemists were aimed for nature creatures.</p>

  <p>Besides, Evan had a solid foundation, and obviously, he didn't need to rely on well-refined pills. He relied entirely on his own ability to make three breakthroughs in a row, which substantially showed that his talent was really appalling.</p>

  <p>"Well, good to hear that! However, since you have reached the sixth grade of Illuminating Soul Realm, I am sorry to tell you that you will be removed from the Cloud Sect List according to established conventions.</p>

  <p>Now, I will announce the final rankings of the All Peaks Competition," the elder said in a happy tone.</p>

  <p>According to the established conventions of Cloud Sect, the strength level required for the All Peaks Competition and Cloud Sect List was capped, and the strongest participants were not allowed to be beyond the third grade of Illuminating Soul Realm. Anyone who was able to train beyond this level would be automatically removed from the List and disqualified to attend any of the related competitions.</p>

  <p>With his earlier strength level, he did have the qualification to participate in the All Peaks Competition. But that was a little while ago. When he had walked out from his secret chamber, his strength had leapt directly from the third grade of Illuminating Soul Realm to the sixth grade. This was not only beyond the capped requirement, but also very slightly weaker than the topmost grade of Illuminating Soul Realm. That was to say, it wasn't going to be a long time before his realm became comparable to the saints, or even the elders with relatively weaker strength.</p>

  <p>What was more, it was well known that Evan had a solid foundation.</p>

  <p>This was unlike many saints and elders in the Cloud Sect who were unable to make breakthroughs after a particular level, and therefore had to achieve their current strength only with the aid of well-refined pills. In terms of real strength, he might not be too far from them.</p>

  <p>Under the above situation, it was obviously not fair to allow Evan to attend the All Peaks Competition.</p>

  <p>"No! Elder Ge! No matter if I am alive or dead, I will always be Cloud Sect's disciple. Why do you want to remove me from the List? Please! I really want to attend this year's All Peaks Competition and I really have to! Although I have made breakthroughs, my name is still on this year's list of All Peaks Competition Participants, right?" Evan argued strongly, trying to convince Elder Ge and the others.</p>
