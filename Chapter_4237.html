  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was no room for Luo Nian to resist. Even if there were, he wasn't strong enough. After swaying around in the air for a while, he was thrown on the back of a spider.</p>

  <p>Although his chest had been pierced, the wound was not fatal. He somersaulted and tried to break free from the spider. He almost succeeded too, but right before he could break free, the sharp teeth on the back of the spider expanded outwards and formed a cage that imprisoned him. He could move about very slightly now, but could not break free.</p>

  <p>After Luo Nian was captured, most of the spiders scattered towards the back of the path.</p>

  <p>However, the one that had captured him ran forwards with its long legs.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian knew that he had to break free. After stopping the bleeding from the wound on his chest, he stretched out his hands and grabbed two of the spider's teeth, trying to break them apart.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the power burst out from his hands, the teeth suddenly turned red. And instantly, as if two pieces of red-hot soldering iron had scalded his hands, he quickly let go of them. It was as if he had grabbed a solid fire.</p>

  <p>"Great! I can't leave now," Luo Nian sulked, rubbing his hands helplessly.</p>

  <p>In the Abstruse Energy World, he had been rather lucky and had not encountered any danger.</p>

  <p>Even while facing the most troublesome bronze statues, all he had to do was lure them down and let Ziya kill them.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that he was facing these unknown creatures all by himself. He looked calm on the outside, but in fact, he was extremely flustered.</p>

  <p>His only comfort was the fact that the spider had only trapped him and not swallowed him whole in a single gulp. Furthermore, the spider was heading towards the center of the Sky Wheel City, and its speed was ten times faster than his own.</p>

  <p>Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!</p>

  <p>To the naked eye, the Sky Wheel City did not seem so far away, but the path was actually quite long.</p>

  <p>It took ten hours even for the spider to cover half the distance. After a full day and night's journey, the spider finally got close to the center of the city.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian himself would have needed at least ten days to cover this path.</p>

  <p>The spider had indirectly helped him shorten the voyage, but he was not happy at all.</p>

  <p>While nearing the city center, the spider proceeded towards a large, arched building and entered inside.</p>

  <p>Inside, Luo Nian saw many spiders, all of whom were carrying all sorts of creatures on their backs, and slowly moving forward in a queue.</p>

  <p>The spider in front of Luo Nian was carrying a huge bug on its back. The bug kept on struggling, but was unable to escape from the sharp teeth. Its body would occasionally touch the sharp teeth, and get scalded in the process.</p>

  <p>Further ahead was a spider carrying a little monster with very long hands, legs, and tail. The monster was sitting quietly in the cage, staring at Luo Nian with a faint smile on his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian frowned, ignored the little monster, and then continued to look at the other trapped creatures.</p>

  <p>The creatures and entities that thrived in the Deep Space were quite mysterious and incomprehensible in the eyes of creatures from third-grade and fourth-grade worlds. In fact, even their forms were indescribable.</p>

  <p>However, in Luo Nian's eyes, these creatures were somewhat simple.</p>

  <p>Most of the creatures that had been sent here were very primitive. The only ones that looked a bit intelligent was the little monster.</p>

  <p>The spiders in the long line moved forward slowly, and Luo Nian felt uneasy. The spiders were definitely up to something. He didn't know what kind of danger he was going to encounter.</p>

  <p>Once the spiders had moved a certain distance, Luo Nian saw a triangular platform in front of the line. There was an incision of about three feet at the bottom of the platform, and the spiders would perfectly fit inside it, putting the prey in the cages on their backs into the triangular platform.</p>

  <p>When Luo Nian was concentrating on observing the triangular platform, he suddenly saw a flash of golden light and heard a strange scream from the platform. Then a spider retreated from the platform.</p>

  <p>The prey on its back had disappeared completely, leaving nothing but a pile of ashes behind. The spider dumped the black ashes on the ground and then left calmly.</p>

  <p>"Oh no! That is bad!"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian's mind went blank when he saw this.</p>

  <p>What on earth did these spiders want to do?</p>

  <p>Were they capturing these creatures from thousands of miles away just to burn them to ashes? That seemed unlikely.</p>

  <p>One spider after another entered the triangular platform to verify Luo Nian's judgment. With every flash of golden light, the prey on the back of a spider would be burnt to ashes.</p>

  <p>Very soon after that, it was the little monster's turn.</p>

  <p>The little monster seemed quite calm, and there was a constant smile on his distinctive face throughout the whole process.</p>

  <p>"He is still smiling even though it is certain he is going to die," Luo Nian remarked to himself, gritting his teeth.</p>

  <p>However, after the little monster was sent in, there was no golden flash from the triangular platform. The spider that was carrying him retreated, and he was safe and sound.</p>

  <p>When he came out, the monster looked at Luo Nian with an even brighter smile. He even stretched out his hands and made a gesture that seemed like cutting one's neck repeatedly. He was also making a howling sound.</p>

  <p>The gesture might have been provocative, or it might have been a greeting, but Luo Nian was elated in any case. He had finally seen a creature come out alive.</p>

  <p>This meant that there was a slim chance of survival while inside the triangular platform. Luo Nian still had a chance to live.</p>

  <p>Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!</p>

  <p>Next, it was the turn of the bug in front of Luo Nian. A few seconds after the bug was sent in, the golden light flashed again, and then the spider came out with ashes on its back.</p>

  <p>"Okay... My turn."</p>

  <p>Luo Nian took a deep breath and got ready.</p>

  <p>When he was taken into the triangular platform, a huge mirror appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>There were fifteen small cubes arranged neatly on the left side of the mirror, and only one on the right side. The sixteenth one seemed to be a corner piece of the large cube that the fifteen other ones were trying to form.</p>

  <p>"This is a test?"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was stunned for a moment. Then he quickly moved the cube on the right side to the left, forming a complete cube.</p>

  <p>After that, the scene in the mirror changed abruptly. This time also, several cubes were laid out on the mirror. They were a bit more than a dozen in number.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian thought for a while and then rearranged them into a pattern.</p>

  <p>After that, the scene in the mirror changed again.</p>

  <p>This time, several cubes and round blocks were mixed together, and Luo Nian knew that he only needed to separate them to pass this round.</p>

  <p>After he completed the three puzzles, the scene in the mirror disappeared, and it became blank.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was very nervous. The three questions had all been very simple, but he didn't know if he had passed the test. If the golden light flashed, he would directly turn into ashes.</p>

  <p>It was not until the spider that was carrying him began to slowly move that he heaved a heavy sigh of relief. He had passed through one very big hurdle.</p>

  <p>Although he was still trapped, escaping the jaws of death felt exhilarating.</p>

  <p>'The spiders capture their prey and then select the intelligent ones among them. Those who don't pass the test are burnt to a crisp, and the intelligent ones are allowed to live, '</p>

  <p>Luo Nian thought, feeling much more relieved.</p>

  <p>If the spiders were selecting intelligent creatures so creatively, it meant that they themselves possessed intelligence. This meant that he could communicate with them. And no matter what they were going to do, as long as he could communicate with them, he didn't need to worry.</p>

  <p>After the test, the spider carried Luo Nian out of the arched building, and descended a flight of stairs that led to a huge underground space. Now there were cages on either side of the space in which all sorts of strange creatures were trapped.</p>

  <p>They had already passed the test presumably, so naturally possessed enough intelligence.</p>

  <p>When Luo Nian was carried in, he attracted the attention of all of those creatures. Some of the monsters even greeted him through the fences by letting out strange screams of excitement.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian didn't know what they were trying to say, so he simply ignored them. After the spider found an empty cage, it stuffed Luo Nian inside and the door was shut!</p>
