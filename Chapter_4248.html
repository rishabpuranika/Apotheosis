<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite the path continuing before him, Geoffrey didn't rush up the tower.</p>

  <p>Instead, he stood there and waited patiently.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, a member of the Elemental race opened his eyes and found himself safe. His eyes gleamed with excitement.</p>

  <p>He then noticed that Geoffrey had already left the illusion and tried to say something, but Geoffrey didn't understand a single word.</p>

  <p>Soon, the second one woke up. This left only Elder Xue and the last one stuck in the illusion.</p>

  <p>"They should wake up soon," Geoffrey said, nodding with certainty.</p>

  <p>After all, he had seen once before that the pace of the members of the Elemental race in the first half of the Levitation Tower was very fast. It wouldn't take long.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, he saw the two lines under the feet of the still unconscious member begin to recede.</p>

  <p>When the other two members also took notice, they immediately cried out anxiously, but there was nothing they could do.</p>

  <p>Everyone had their own path, and they could only move within the lines under their feet. No one dared cross their lines in the slightest.</p>

  <p>When the lines drew back to the feet of that member, the originally green lines turned red. Then, that member's legs were burned by an invisible flame, until he was nothing but a pile of white ashes.</p>

  <p>"He is dead!" Geoffrey exclaimed in horror, his eyes twitching.</p>

  <p>Although he was painfully aware that those who entered the Levitation Tower were willing to sacrifice their lives, he couldn't help but feel depressed with what he just witnessed.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he was also consumed with worry about Elder Xue's safety. What was taking him so long? Would he die here?</p>

  <p>Just as Geoffrey felt like his anxiety was eating him alive, Elder Xue's body trembled slightly. When he finally opened his eyes, Geoffrey heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>When the two members of the Elemental race saw Elder Xue wake up, they pointed at the wafting white ashes and jabbered something incomprehensible. Elder Xue understood what they meant. After comforting them, he said to Geoffrey, "He must have lied when the Levitation Tower asked him those questions, so he couldn't pass the test.</p>

  <p>As I've said many times, no matter what the Levitation Tower asks, you must tell the truth. Remember this!"</p>

  <p>Elder Xue focused all his efforts on Geoffrey. Just now, he used the death of this member as a learning experience for Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"I'll keep that in mind." Geoffrey nodded shakily. He knew he had no choice but to obey Elder Xue, since this was a matter of life and death.</p>

  <p>Then together, the remaining four continued to walk along the green lines.</p>

  <p>"Those who enter the Levitation Tower will stay at the height of twenty feet for a while and then rise steadily to the height of fifty feet. I don't think there will be any test during this process," Elder Xue said as he walked.</p>

  <p>He had observed this many times, and this time he could finally verify his theory.</p>

  <p>As he said, the four of them walked around the Levitation Tower two times, and they encountered no obstacles all the way up to the height of fifty feet. The consciousness in their minds had been silent, but the moment they reached the height of fifty feet, another red line appeared in front of them and blocked their way. At the same time, the consciousness in their minds raised another question.</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid of death?"</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey heard this question, his heart skipped a beat. He had a bad feeling about this, but he still answered firmly, "Yes!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The wisp of consciousness once again hit his soul.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he found himself in a new illusion.</p>

  <p>There was a two-foot-long saber in front of him. Not far away was a large lake. By the lakeside, he saw the figure of the little girl with the pale face again.</p>

  <p>"Nice to meet you again," the little girl said with a bright, cheerful smile.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey ignored her momentarily and looked around vigilantly.</p>

  <p>Since the question this time was about death, he figured the test must have something to do with death.</p>

  <p>The biggest difficulty of the illusion was that there were too few hints. If he wanted to pass the test, he needed to probe around further.</p>

  <p>After taking a few apprehensive steps forward, Geoffrey picked up the saber cautiously. Gripping it tightly in his hand, he asked the girl, "Why are you still here? Are you here to help me?"</p>

  <p>"I won't help you," the little girl said, smiling as though she knew all the secrets of the world. "I just want to watch you die. Those who are afraid of death will surely die."</p>

  <p>"Watch me die? Those who are afraid of death will surely die?" Geoffrey echoed confusedly.</p>

  <p>Taking another look at his surroundings, he saw that there was only the lake in front of him. Was it going to drown him?</p>

  <p>With his cultivation base, it was impossible for him to drown, but this was an illusion, so anything was possible...</p>

  <p>As soon as this dawned on Geoffrey, he noticed a dark shadow moving swiftly at the bottom of the lake. His eyes widened and he immediately retreated a few steps backward.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>When Geoffrey retreated several hundred feet, a vine shot out from the lake's surface, rushing towards him like an arrow.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, it coiled around Geoffrey's ankle.</p>

  <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p>

  <p>Geoffrey haphazardly chopped at the vine with the saber in his hand. To his horror, the vine was extremely solid, as though it were made of metal.</p>

  <p>Sparks flew out in all directions whenever he slashed at the vine, but the vine remained unscathed. Before he could think of something, the vine dragged him into the water.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>Just as Geoffrey had suspected, he felt suffocated upon entering the water.</p>

  <p>He was drowning!</p>

  <p>Although he struggled madly, the vine was as solid as an iron whip. No matter how hard he tried, he was unable to break free from it.</p>

  <p>Standing by the lake, the little girl bent over to watch. Looking at Geoffrey who was struggling under the water, she smiled almost innocently, but her eyes betrayed a sense of malice.</p>

  <p>As Geoffrey felt as though his lungs were about to explode, his consciousness began to wane.</p>

  <p>If he blacked out, he would really die here.</p>

  <p>Thinking of how the member of the Elemental race had been burnt into a pile of ashes, he shuddered. He definitely didn't want to die that way.</p>

  <p>"I... I want to live!"</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth, he was determined to survive.</p>

  <p>Since the little girl wasn't going to help him, and he couldn't cut the vine, he decided to use the saber on his own self.</p>

  <p>Making up his mind, he swung the saber at his legs desperately.</p>

  <p>He hadn't suffered much growing up, but now, at such a critical situation, he moved swiftly and ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Blood began to paint the bottom of the water red as he severed his right leg. Breaking free from his shackles, he swam to the surface of the lake and gasped for air. Just as he was hungrily drinking up oxygen, another vine shot out from the bottom of the lake. This time, it was his left leg that was caught.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>This time, Geoffrey became more decisive. Before he was pulled to the bottom of the lake, he sliced off his left leg.</p>

  <p>Despite it being an illusion, everything felt very real. The pain from severing both his legs was unbearable.</p>

  <p>"Which body parts do you want? Just tell me! I'll give you everything! As long as I can live!" Geoffrey roared at the little girl fiercely.</p>

  <p>The little girl seemed to be a little disappointed. Lowering her head, she thought for a while. It seemed as though she'd lost interest in Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>"This is boring. You are really afraid of death. Then, let's end this."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, the illusion shook and disappeared with her.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey found himself back in the Levitation Tower, soaked with sweat.</p>

  <p>After successfully passing the test, he felt like he was an extremely lucky survivor.</p>

  <p>Looking to see if his companions had passed too, he was stunned when he saw that Elder Xue and the two members of the Elemental race were trembling. What sort of torture were they going through?</p>

  <p>"My answer was 'yes', yet the test was so horrible. Elder Xue and the others have a stable state of mind, so they must've answered 'no'. The illusions they are facing are probably ten times more difficult," Geoffrey said, shaking his head worriedly.</p>
