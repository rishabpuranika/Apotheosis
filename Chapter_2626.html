  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luther walked up to Emily and looked around at the body that she had cut in two. He then said sorrowfully, "This man had the bloodline mark.</p>

  <p>He could find me as long as he was within a certain radius of me. The Warden race has started!"</p>

  <p>The bloodline mark seemed to have a comparatively small range of perception. Luther and Zelda couldn't have escaped the hunt of the Warden race otherwise.</p>

  <p>Emily glanced at Luther before saying, "It's not just the Warden race."</p>

  <p>"Did any other great races join them?" Luther asked, grinning. He was quite optimistic.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry," Emily said, grinning back at him. "I will keep you safe."</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that several elders and some of the exiles of the Snake Goddess race arrived at the scene. Luther's sister, Zelda, was the last to arrive.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew how important Luther was. And now that Luther had been attacked, nervousness crept up on all of them.</p>

  <p>But they were even more nervous because of Emily, whose eyes roved over them. And it was her who brought the hidden dangers in the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Master Emily, should we bring Luther to a more secluded place?" an elder asked.</p>

  <p>Zelda shook her head. "I felt the bloodline mark too. As long as we are in this bone tower, there's no point hiding him."</p>

  <p>At the worried faces of the crowd, Emily smiled and said, "Don't worry.</p>

  <p>Both the Yellow Emperor race and the Warden race only dare act in the dark. Now that I'm here, there's nothing they can do!"</p>

  <p>Emily was the strongest exile in this world. Only Spark of the Yellow Emperor race and Timotheus of the Nine Li race could come close to even being second to her. She was confident about her own strength.</p>

  <p>Everyone nodded. There was no point in hiding him if Emily couldn't protect him.</p>

  <p>But a space vortex appeared behind them, and Timotheus emerged from it.</p>

  <p>During other times, exiles weren't allowed to enter the bone tower of the Snake Goddess race without permission. But these times were different.</p>

  <p>Top-ranking races were now looking after each other, according to their agreement. So they weren't bothered about the rules.</p>

  <p>The moment he appeared, Timotheus's face darkened as he saw the assassin's body. "Emily, are you all right here?"</p>

  <p>The Sky Spirit Bone Tower was also under siege by the Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>Timotheus was worried about the Snake Goddess race, once he had dealt with the Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>Emily smiled and replied, "Just some ants. They have been taken care of."</p>

  <p>Timotheus nodded and then sneered, "Spark is so stupid to have used such a naive trick!"</p>

  <p>The space around the crowd began to fluctuate again.</p>

  <p>The exiles of the Star Deer race, the Fire Melting race, and the Southern Dipper race appeared in quick succession. Like Timotheus, they expressed their concerns with Luther and Zelda.</p>

  <p>Some of them were ready to give up their bone towers and clansmen, if it meant that Luther and Zelda didn't die.</p>

  <p>It was pretty obvious how important Luther and Zelda were to them.</p>

  <p>But when they learned about what had happened, they were all relieved.</p>

  <p>"Spark has always been cunning. But this time, his idea was so, so bad!"</p>

  <p>"The Warden race takes Luther and Zelda very seriously. It looks like we are likely to succeed this time!"</p>

  <p>"We will set out once the Light of Adjudication is over."</p>

  <p>In this pleasantly hopeful atmosphere, Levi Zhuang, one of the Star Deer race's exiles, took two steps towards Luther. "They have attacked for the first time, and I'm sure they will do it a second time. We'd better be careful. How about I use my theurgy to create a small piece of land to protect Luther?" he said.</p>

  <p>Emily and Timotheus frowned and looked at each other.</p>

  <p>Emily shook her head and said, "Why bother? It's unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>Levi Zhuang had barely finished talking when there was a sudden flash of black light in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He suddenly stretched out his arms, extending them towards Luther.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>"Levi Zhuang! How dare you!"</p>

  <p>"Stop it!"</p>

  <p>The exiles belonging to the other races were all shocked.</p>

  <p>As an exile, Levi Zhuang could move at an amazingly fast speed.</p>

  <p>People like the elders of the Snake Goddess race couldn't react.</p>

  <p>Neither could Luther.</p>

  <p>Levi Zhuang was faster than lightning. In the blink of an eye, he had grasped Luther's head in his hand and with a gentle pull, separated it from Luther's body. Levi Zhuang crushed Luther's head in his hands and before long, it had become a mass of blood.</p>

  <p>Luther was dead.</p>

  <p>Levi Zhuang laughed and floated in the air, distancing himself from the other exiles.</p>

  <p>Emily and Timotheus were frozen to their spots as they stared at Levi Zhuang.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Emily, Timotheus," Levi Zhuang said with a wry smile, holding Luther's mutilated head in one hand. "There are only a limited number of people who can leave this world, and I want to fight for one!"</p>

  <p>Emily stared coldly at him, fury enveloping her every nerve. "If we make it, you can leave too. Why do you still fight for the Warden race?"</p>

  <p>Levi Zhuang waved the head in his hand and said, "Because you are doomed to fail. I don't think you can succeed! It turns out I'm right.</p>

  <p>You've already failed. I'm going to trade his head for a place to leave.</p>

  <p>Why wouldn't I do this?"</p>

  <p>Spark hadn't expected the assassins of the Wild Gods to finish the task.</p>

  <p>The only reason he had tried so hard was to create a reasonable opportunity for other exiles to visit the Torrent Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>And before that, Spark had given Levi Zhuang his promise.</p>

  <p>As long as Levi Zhuang killed that young man, the Warden race would let him go. He hesitated for a while before he had made his decision, choosing to betray his companions.</p>

  <p>The two assassins had used the Warden race's bloodline mark to determine Luther's location. Levi Zhuang had then taken the opportunity to visit the Snake Goddess race and when they'd relaxed their guard, had killed Luther. This method was direct, but effective.</p>

  <p>Emily sighed and shook her head. "You're wrong. You had the chance to leave with us..."</p>

  <p>At these words, Levi Zhuang was suddenly uneasy. He gripped the head tightly and said, "Luther's already dead. Do you still have the chance?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus grinned and said, "You should be the one to die."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the blood on the head in Levi Zhuang's hand turned into wisps of black mists, and wrapped around him like little snakes.</p>
