  <p>
</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Irvin was able to approach Wynn because of his previous explosive force.</p>

  <p>By the time he arrived in front of Wynn, his burst of power had been consumed completely. Supreme Lord Irvin's fist struck Wynn's chest without power and fell away limply. And then, the broken half of Supreme Lord Irvin's body fell away and towards the ground.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Irvin was dead!</p>

  <p>The Sacred Supreme Lords were stunned as they saw this.</p>

  <p>They knew that a True God was strong, but Wynn's strength had exceeded even their imaginations. It was only a handful of starlight, but it was powerful enough to easily kill Supreme Lord Irvin. So how would they be able to withstand it?</p>

  <p>"I'll fight him to the death!"</p>

  <p>"I will freeze the supreme world with frost!"</p>

  <p>"I'll risk my life to kill him!"</p>

  <p>"With so many of us attacking together, what a True God can do to us?"</p>

  <p>At Supreme Lord Irvin's miserable death, the Supreme Lords realized just how childish their previous thoughts had been.</p>

  <p>Only a True God from the Sacred race could fight such a powerful True God before them.</p>

  <p>Merely defending themselves couldn't possibly mean that they were a match for this True God. If they wanted to live, they had to fight by putting their lives on the line!</p>

  <p>Different Heavenly Destinies simultaneously released lights of different colors.</p>

  <p>Over 50 Supreme Lords released the life vitality within their bodies at the same time. They activated their Heavenly Destinies to launch one of the strongest strikes that was ever to be launched. But just how terrifying was the power that this strike contained?</p>

  <p>Even a True God wouldn't be able to take it head-on.</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Wynn's face as he took a step back. He stepped into the door formed by the power of space and as he did so, the door dissipated. He had left using the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>The Star Sealing Technique could target a specific group of people. The only ones that were restrained by space were the Sacred Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that difficult for Wynn to kill a Supreme Lord. But dozens of Supreme Lords were charging at him. He knew that he couldn't defeat them all. Not to forget the fact that there were some extremely powerful Supreme Lords who were capable of fighting a True God.</p>

  <p>Moreover, his mission was only to lock these Supreme Lords within the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>There obviously were others who couldn't wait to kill them and who would display their abilities to finish the Sacred Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>A massive space windstorm exploded in the skies above the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>A warship, one hundred thousand feet high and one million feet long, emerged from the space storm. The two sides of the warship were inlaid with densely-packed supreme life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>These life vitality jades were not used to provide energy to the warship, but to maintain the four massive divine texture arrays.</p>

  <p>They were the Long Vine Array, Buddha Emperor Array, Giant Sun Array, and the Heavenly Tooth Array.</p>

  <p>Once the four arrays were activated, the shadows of four huge swords appeared around the warship.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was seated at the side of the ship. She made a mysterious gesture with her hands and then pointed her fingers at the four swords.</p>

  <p>Setting up the complete Gods Killing Sword Array required the Long Vine Sword, Buddha Emperor Sword, Grant Sun Sword, and the Heavenly Tooth Sword. But none of these swords were in the Evolutionary Universe. Fortunately, there were powerful array experts within the Celestial Position. They deducted the prototypes of the four swords used by the Gods Killing Sword Array Margret had inherited and used the divine texture technique to create four virtual swords.</p>

  <p>This method would consume a great deal of life vitality jades, but this cost was nothing when compared to how the Evolutionary Universe would be benefited.</p>

  <p>As Mu Ning finished arranging the array according to the technique, the four swords looked like they had been completely integrated into the Gods Killing Sword Array. She looked into the distance, pointed her third finger and little finger at the sky, and said, "Go!" The four swords penetrated through the vast sea of clouds, shooting towards the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>The four swords shot out and stirred the clouds above the Sunflower Water World into disorder.</p>

  <p>At the same time?</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment appeared on the other side of the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>Four monks stood behind Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment. These four monks were the four Supreme Lords of the Hidden Spirit Temple: Shay, Jamal, Jace, and Alyx.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Blessed Buddha Land, besides Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment, were not well-known in the Evolutionary Universe, and they rarely wandered around the world. But no one could ignore their strength, especially their technique to set up the Grand Buddha Pagoda.</p>

  <p>"Shay!"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Jamal!"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Jace!"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"Alyx!"</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"With all the Buddhas in mind, all the powers become one!"</p>

  <p>"Getting rid of all distracted thoughts and emotions, we'll stop at nothing!"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Colorful rays of shining light soared into the sky, illuminating the whole Sunflower Water World and coating it in a layer of golden light.</p>

  <p>An enormous pagoda suddenly appeared in the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>To the people, it looked like it had no end to its height. If it was placed horizontally, even the Sunflower Water World would probably not be enough to contain it.</p>

  <p>No matter where one was in the Sunflower Water World, they could clearly see the pagoda.</p>

  <p>"Grand Buddha Pagoda! Subdue!"</p>

  <p>A maroon light appeared between the brows of Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment and the other four Supreme Lords. Although the auras around them were mild, they were vigorous and lasting and at the moment, were rushing towards the depths of the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>And then, illusory stars popped up, one after another.</p>

  <p>The four leaders of the Thoughtless Minds had also entered the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>The techniques that Mike had taught his disciples were mostly about the stars.</p>

  <p>The four great clans of the Thoughtless Minds, the Xuanyuan Clan, the Ji Clan where Janet was from, the Lie Clan, and the Ji Clan where Lucille was from, all had descendants of Mike's disciples.</p>

  <p>Even the Star Destroying Array technique, which the four clans had joined hands to perform, had something to do with stars.</p>

  <p>A space crack appeared not far away from Luo Luo Zheng, from which walked out Supreme Lord Healum.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum smiled at Luo Luo Zheng with a hint of admiration on his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had killed three Supreme Lords in a row, which had shocked the group of Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe. Luo Luo Zheng was only a world lord, but killing the Supreme Lords had been as easy to him as killing chickens or dogs. Such a terrifying ability could awe anyone, which was why many Supreme Lords were glad that Luo Luo Zheng was on the same side as them.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng still had a huge weakness at the moment. His Grand Teleportation was just too slow.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords had the ability to cross several supreme worlds in an instant. But Luo Luo Zheng often needed more time just to cross one. And although the Teleportation Token allowed Luo Luo Zheng to quickly teleport to any supreme world, it couldn't accurately send him to his destination. This was why Luo Luo Zheng had to constantly travel to reach his destination after he used the Teleportation Token.</p>

  <p>"I'll send you there," Supreme Lord Healum said to Luo Luo Zheng. With his current strength, Luo Luo Zheng was qualified to participate in a battle of this level. Once Wynn had sealed off the space around the Sacred Supreme Lords, Luo Luo Zheng could be of great help by killing the Sacred Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded as he held the Great Weighty Sword in his hand before Supreme Lord Healum connected to Luo Luo Zheng using the Space Lock. The Space Lock could not be used to defend against enemies, but by working with powerful warriors, it could still display some absolutely terrifying effects.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt himself rising into the air the moment he was linked by the Space Lock. He started to move at an unimaginable speed, flying towards the depths of the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>In the Murphy Universe, above the borders of the Sacred Sea World, Close to a hundred Sacred Supreme Lords had already gathered. They stood there, gazing at the supreme world channel in a daze.</p>

  <p>Unlike the Evolutionary Universe that had many different races, there was only the Sacred race within the Murphy Universe. It was easy to gather all of the Sacred Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>"Wynn has probably embedded a Dark Star in the passageway. It swooped down into the channel and stuck itself forcibly into it. It's impossible to use brute force to break it!" a Sacred Supreme Lord reported.</p>

  <p>The face of the Grand Supreme Lord who was at the helm darkened.</p>

  <p>"Can't we even travel through space?"</p>

  <p>"No, we can't. The other side of the Dark Star has been completely sealed off. It's impossible to use the Grand Teleportation to reach the other side," the Sacred Supreme Lord said, shaking his head again.</p>

  <p>"I'll give it a try."</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Lord was impatient, as if on fire. He realized that he had underestimated the Evolutionary Universe and that they had been too careless in their actions.</p>

  <p>They had originally thought that as long as the passage of the Sighing Wall was opened, they would be able to enter the Evolutionary Universe whenever they wanted. Who would have thought that someone would block the passage at such a critical moment!</p>

  <p>If they couldn't make a move to reinforce in time, the 50-odd Supreme Lords that had been sent into the Evolutionary Universe would be doomed.</p>

  <p>Not long after the Grand Supreme Lord entered the passageway, a gentle Mu Ning erupted from inside. When the Supreme Lords outside the passageway felt this Mu Ning, they understood that the Grand Supreme Lord had used the Heavens-suppressing Object. He wanted to take advantage of the Murphy Universe's momentum to open up the passage.</p>

  <p>It was not long before the Grand Supreme Lord emerged from the passageway, looking dejected. It was pretty obvious that he had failed.</p>

  <p>"We can only ask Pranav for help."</p>

  <p>Pranav was the True God of the Murphy Universe, who was also Murphy's disciple. Holy Beings only allowed their most trusted people to enter the universes they had built on their own.</p>
