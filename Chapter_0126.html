<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Ah, Jesse went too far. It is only a challenge between two peaks. Why did he use that fierce strike? Does he want to kill Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"The battle ring is made of pure iron, which is very hard. But it was easily cut by the sky-rending hoops as if the ring was as soft as mud. If the sky-rending hoops touch a human, his body will be split in two!"</p>

  <p>"It's too dangerous. How will Luo Luo Zheng deal with this attack?"</p>

  <p>Now, everyone was worried about Luo Luo Zheng. They watched him with bated breath.</p>

  <p>When the sky-rending hoops neared Luo Luo Zheng, he twisted his body at a strange angle and slid through the space among the hoops.</p>

  <p>At the same time, leveraging his momentum, Luo Luo Zheng dodged another four sky-rending hoops that had been flying above and below him. After his successful dodges, he ran toward Jesse at full speed.</p>

  <p>The previous round of fighting between the two contestants had only been a prelude. And now formal combat, with fist to fist strikes, would begin between the two.</p>

  <p>Jesse's face was calm as he watched Luo Luo Zheng rushing toward him. He didn't seem to be flustered. Instead, his expression reflected the seriousness he felt. He waved his hand, and the seven sky-rending hoops left behind by Luo Luo Zheng adjusted their directions and turned toward Luo Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>These seven sky-rending hoops were produced by Jesse's life vitality.</p>

  <p>Their weights were as light as air, and they could fly at a fantastically high speed.</p>

  <p>Even though Luo Luo Zheng was also very fast, he still needed to consider whether to boost his speed or to keep away from the hoops chasing him. If he did not dodge, he would be cut into pieces by these hoops before he could get close to Jesse.</p>

  <p>This was also the reason why Jesse stood still and regarded Luo Luo Zheng with his steady gaze. He had used the sky-rending hoops many times to defeat dozens of rivals. He understood how powerful the hoops were and what would be the result if someone met the sky-rending hoops directly. It could not be different this time, and he was sure that Luo Luo Zheng would not dare use his body to fend off the attack from the sky-rending hoops.</p>

  <p>However, Jesse was wrong this time.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng's body had still been at the level of mysterious weapon, he would have been terrified of the cutting power of this sky-rending hoops.</p>

  <p>However, his physical body had improved in strength after being cultivated by the fire of the Earth's core. His physical strength and body hardness were different from what he was at the level of mysterious weapon. So, Luo Luo Zheng intended to use his body to counter the attack of the sky-rending hoops.</p>

  <p>'Oh, my god! Why doesn't he run away? Is he crazy? Or does he want to die?'</p>

  <p>Jesse was very confused when he saw that Luo Luo Zheng did not have the slightest intention to dodge the attack. Such actions by Luo Luo Zheng, in his eyes, were equal to suicide. How could a person face the sharp hoops without any hesitance?</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, run away! Be quick!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! If he doesn't get out of the way, he will be cut into pieces by the sky-rending hoops!"</p>

  <p>"Is Luo Luo Zheng crazy? Let's stop here. Stop the sky-rending hoops. Come down from the arena, Luo Luo Zheng. Please! Be quick!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Luo Zheng was not avoiding the attack, all the disciples of Drizzle Peak voiced their concerns. They shouted to get Luo Zheng's attention, hoping that he would listen to them and dodge the hoops or even give up the fight.</p>

  <p>Although disciples within the peak were known to hold grudges and fight among themselves, when it came to challenges between peaks, the disciples of each peak stood united. They shared the same worry about Luo Zheng's safety.</p>

  <p>'We can afford to lose this challenge, but Luo Luo Zheng should not die!' All the disciples of Drizzle Peak clenched their fists. They kept shouting at Luo Luo Zheng to avoid the attack.</p>

  <p>The refiners from Vulture Peak, however, were satisfied to see the current scene in the arena. Their lips curled in a contemptuous sneer.</p>

  <p>"Look! This guy must be insane!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think so. Maybe it's better for him to die. There is no friendship in a battle. If he wants to die without any defense, the hoops will not have any mercy on him."</p>

  <p>"Well, that is a pity! Drizzle Peak just enrolled a genius disciple, and Jesse is going to shred this genius!"</p>

  <p>According to the disciples of Vulture Peak, Luo Zheng's nonresistance would eventually lead to his death. That was a good result for them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, as a representative of Drizzle Peak, had defeated three of Vulture Peak's top 20 disciples. And he only used one punch to win each fight.</p>

  <p>That was a big shame for every disciple of Vulture Peak!</p>

  <p>This failure had never happened in the history of Vulture Peak, and it could not be forgotten or recovered by any means.</p>

  <p>Besides, Luo Luo Zheng was only at the marrow refining level. If he did not die today, he would grow quickly and become a significant threat to Vulture Peak. They were afraid that he would challenge all the disciples of their peak in the future.</p>

  <p>Though it was too early to foresee what would happen in the coming years, their concerns were not unfounded.</p>

  <p>Just two years before, a genius from Lady Peak, Yan, had defeated all disciples of Day Peak. And as a result, the ranking of Day Peak dropped from sixth to somewhere in the mid-twenties. What a horrifying experience for the disciples of Day Peak and the onlookers of other peaks.</p>

  <p>Therefore, at this moment, the disciples of Vulture Peak did not feel uncomfortable about the scene in the arena even though it meant that Luo Luo Zheng might die. In their minds, it would be prudent to kill Luo Luo Zheng, a genius, at this time before he refined himself further and became a more significant threat to them.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was not a normal refiner as they had thought. What happened next was entirely out of their expectation and dumbfounded everyone watching the fight.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The first sky-rending hoop crashed into Luo Luo Zheng and made a clear sound like a piece of gold bumping into an iron weapon. To everyone's surprise, the golden hoop did not cut Luo Luo Zheng into pieces but instead, it bounced to the side.</p>

  <p>Even though the hoop did not cut Luo Zheng's body, it did shred his white robe.</p>

  <p>The torn white robe exposed Luo Zheng's back to the public.</p>

  <p>On his naked back, people could only see a light trace of blood. They held their breath and couldn't utter a word. They could not believe that such a powerful weapon only left such a small injury on Luo Zheng's skin. That was so unimaginable!</p>

  <p>However, this was only the start of how much Luo Luo Zheng would astound them today. The remaining sky-rending hoops continued to hurtle toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When they crashed into him, each of them also made the clear sound like the first hoop. "Bang!" The second hoop clashed with Luo Luo Zheng and bounced away.</p>

  <p>"Bang!" The third hoop was also deflected after touching Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"Bang!" The fourth hoop ricocheted off Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Each of these sky-rending hoops struck Luo Zheng's back, made a loud sound, and then bounced away. None were able to do Luo Luo Zheng any harm.</p>

  <p>In all previous fights where Jesse had used his sky-rending hoops, his opponents had been shredded. But now, none of the hoops could injure Luo Luo Zheng beyond a small gash on his skin. Aside from the depth and shape of the injuries, the outcome of all the hoops was the same. None could cut Luo Luo Zheng into pieces.</p>

  <p>On seeing this fantastic scene, same as the crowd present, or maybe more surprised than the public, Jesse's eyes widened. Fear and trepidation rose in his heart.</p>
