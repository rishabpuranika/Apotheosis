<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was unknown to Zheng how much Wild God Power his body could hold, and how much of it he needed to obtain before the Body Tribulations approached.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods were also divided into three ranks: top, mid, and low.</p>

  <p>The True Gods were also categorized according to that ranking.</p>

  <p>As this kind of division was created by the exiles, it was only natural that they weren't extremely thorough. For one, the strength gap between low-rank Wild Gods was extreme. Zelda, along with the others who could grow hundreds of feet in size, were considered to be low-rank Wild Gods. But then, so were those who could turn their bodies three to four thousand feet taller.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, those who could grow up to more than eight thousand feet were regarded as mid-rank Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>However, there was a threshold to the mid-rank Wild Gods. Once the first Body Tribulation had fallen and one didn't pass it, their body would collapse and it could be the end for them.</p>

  <p>"Half a month has already passed, yet I still can absorb the Wild God Power!"</p>

  <p>In the small cave was Zheng. Stretching himself, he could clearly feel the changes in his body.</p>

  <p>Strong forces that were hard to control immediately flew towards his body. If his spot in the Cave of Wildness wasn't so small, he would've tried activating the Wild God Power just to see his progress and what level he was able to reach.</p>

  <p>Giacomo had reminded Zheng to not activate the Wild God Power inside the Cave of Wildness beforehand.</p>

  <p>If Wild Gods turned into giants in ordinary caves, they could disintegrate the entire place without trouble. However, the Cave of Wildness took shape naturally by the cracks of the bone tower. No matter how strong one's power was, he or she must not turn into a giant in such a cave.</p>

  <p>That particular tragedy had already occurred to the Nine Li race. A Wild God had activated his power in the cave. In return, his body was squeezed to death between the cave walls.</p>

  <p>While getting lost in his thoughts, Zheng was also trying to suck up the pure Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>It stunned Zheng that he was unable to absorb the pale yellow Wild God Power. Instead, it circled around the cave.</p>

  <p>'Wait… Does this mean I've taken in enough power?' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The people outside were all unaware of this sudden matter and just continued to pour the Wild God Power right into the cave.</p>

  <p>"Hey! That's enough! I've absorbed enough!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's voice echoed out of the cave.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's words, Baldwin was overjoyed. "That's enough for now. We don't need to refine more wild bones."</p>

  <p>Although the Nine Li race had a lot of wild bones in their stash, they were for its people and the three sects that were under its control.</p>

  <p>Zheng alone had already consumed millions of wild bones. This was way higher than the consumption of ordinary people.</p>

  <p>Elsa, who was considered a prodigy of the Nine Li race, had only absorbed 800 thousand wild bones. The number of wild bones Zheng consumed was a shock to Baldwin and the others.</p>

  <p>"Stay right there in the cave, Zheng. I'll go right ahead and inform Elder Giacomo," said Baldwin.</p>

  <p>After about five minutes, Giacomo flew over. He looked down from the crack on top of the cave and said to Zheng, "You've actually stayed in the cave for half a month. You have a big appetite!"</p>

  <p>Smiling back at Giacomo, Zheng asked, "So when can I undergo the Body Tribulation?"</p>

  <p>"Since you have absorbed enough Wild God Power, the Body Tribulation will come soon. Take the Tribulation Exterminating Pill given by Grand Elder." Giacomo then threw a shiny pill down to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Without delay, Zheng reached for the pill and stuffed it into his mouth.</p>

  <p>Refined by the exiles in the race, the Tribulation Exterminating Pill served as an aid for people who were about to go through the Body Tribulations.</p>

  <p>The stronger the body was, the more terrifying the Body Tribulations could be. Since Zheng had absorbed a substantial amount of Wild God Power, it was expected that the Body Tribulations he was about to undergo could be colossal. However, the Nine Li race had been well prepared for that.</p>

  <p>Since the resources were scarce, refining the Tribulation Exterminating Pill wasn't that easy. Out of tens of thousands of people in the Nine Li race, only three were granted the pill. Zheng was the fourth one.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng had swallowed the pill, it began to work its magic.</p>

  <p>Almost instantly, he felt his entire body shrink.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>It felt as if Zheng's bones were being ceaselessly squeezed. His eyebrows furrowed at the strangeness of it all. Strange noises of bones rubbing against each other could be heard. It was a peculiar moment.</p>

  <p>Even his internal organs, meridians, and his muscles that were as hard as steel also felt as if they were being crushed inside his body. His entire figure began to wiggle involuntarily.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Zheng asked. Despite his attempts to resist the shrinking force, the tremors all over his body refused to stop.</p>

  <p>"The Body Tribulations have begun," Giacomo stated, a cautious look plastered all over his face.</p>

  <p>He sat cross-legged right above the Cave of Wildness. As he shook a small golden brocade bag in his hand, a lot of blood wild bones rolled out from it.</p>

  <p>When Baldwin and the others noticed how many blood wild bones were pouring out of Giacomo's bag, they went green with envy.</p>

  <p>The ordinary wild bones didn't mean that much to the Nine Li people.</p>

  <p>After all, they had quite a vast part of Immemorial Wilderness under their watch, and there was no need for them to collect the wild bones in person.</p>

  <p>However, there were not many blood wild bones around. Even the Nine Li people didn't have a lot of them.</p>

  <p>"When you undergo the Body Tribulations, you have to absorb all the Wild God Power! Don't waste any of it!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, Giacomo stretched out his hand and reached for the blood wild bones. Wisps of Wild God Power streamed out of the blood wild bones and flowed into the Cave of Wildness.</p>

  <p>"Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng was at a loss. He could not speak, his face was cold, all of his teeth were clattering, and his body was trembling violently.</p>

  <p>"The biggest test during the Body Tribulations is absorbing the blood wild bones. As a reward, I shall grant a member of my race one share of blood wild bones. And you need ten of them. The more blood wild bones you obtain, the stronger the Nine Li Wild Body you'll have. However, the difficulty of undergoing the Body Tribulations will be doubled. This is one heavy test," said Giacomo.</p>

  <p>As far as Giacomo could see, it was a rather hasty move to allow Zheng to absorb ten shares of blood wild bones in one go. But the old man was a master in the Source World, and his foresight was unparalleled. Even so, he still felt a little worried.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished talking, the sound of an explosion could be heard from inside the Cave of Wildness.</p>

  <p>There was a crack on Zheng's left chest, where a half-foot-long wound inside of his heart could be seen.</p>

  <p>Golden blood sprayed out from the crack and splashed unto the walls of the cave.</p>

  <p>During that time, Zheng wasn't in the mood for absorbing the Wild God Power from the wild blood bones. Besides, the Wild God Power that was in his body had overfilled, and he was unable to absorb more.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Wild God Power released by Giacomo seemed to have a mind of its own as it forcefully drilled itself into the wound on Zheng's chest.</p>
