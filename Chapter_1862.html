<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1862 The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land's Secrets </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng left, the entire square started to discuss the matter.</p>

  <p>The most enthusiastic warriors were probably the ones of the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the foreign warriors did not say a word.</p>

  <p>The foreign warriors came from all sorts of races, from different universes or the divine land. They had been paying attention to Luo Luo Zheng, as the special way he was treated by the Collapsing Mountain race made them jealous.</p>

  <p>This special treatment certainly did not make any different for the martial artists from the divine land.</p>

  <p>The fine warriors of the divine land had only one goal: to obtain the strength source. They were not interested in the fact that the warriors of the Collapsing Mountain race were able to refine their bodies by singing songs and devouring the flesh and drinking the blood of beasts of all sorts. The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was really marvelous, but after all, it was created by a Holy Being, and that was why it couldn't be compared with the divine land.</p>

  <p>The divine land was the unexcelled world of real values in their eyes.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why every creature that was born in the divine land felt the right to call all the other creatures being born in other universes "secondary creatures."</p>

  <p>But this time something changed in the warriors of the divine land and it could be noticed on their faces.</p>

  <p>They could not understand how Luo Luo Zheng had obtained so much strength suddenly.</p>

  <p>They wondered if his strength had increased due to the special treatment from the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>They also suspected of the wine given by Chapman to Luo Luo Zheng. The other option they were thinking about was the internal organs of the beasts devoured by him. However eagerly they tried to find it out, the answer was "impossible."</p>

  <p>"Tsk! Tsk! The only possible answer is the strength source Luo Luo Zheng has absorbed," murmured Theodore, the little old man.</p>

  <p>Standing next to Theodore was a completely black-skinned warrior, who also obtained the title of "super powerful warrior." As he overheard the words murmured by Theodore, he coldly remarked, "How much strength source could he manage to gain when he is a mere Spirit Supreme Realm warrior?"</p>

  <p>Theodore frowned deep in his thoughts and raised a question, "What if he activated the Nine Divine Stars?"</p>

  <p>"Humph, is it possible for him to activate them at all?" "Even if he activated the Nine Divine Stars, the amount of the strength source he could imbibe would still be limited and would not be more than the double of the original amount. Even with the help of Eight Path Platforms, he has his limits due to his own body. Even he cannot overstep his limits," reflected the dark-skinned warrior.</p>

  <p>"I am really confused about this." Theodore shook his head in confusion and his eyes were full of malice. He was ready to take the chance anytime to capture Luo Luo Zheng and interrogate him one-to-one.</p>

  <p>However, he knew that he must wait, because this was still the territory of the Collapsing Mountain race and the race had need of Luo Luo Zheng, so they would never let foreign warriors hurt him.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng finished his mission with the Collapsing Mountain race, Theodore was sure to find a chance to capture Luo Luo Zheng and find out his secret.</p>

  <p>Theodore had originally intended to leave the Collapsing Mountain race after the test. Despite the fact that the cultivation in the race could be crucial, he had a better option.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had undoubtedly created a new record.</p>

  <p>They could not even see where Luo Zheng's performance would have ended, because the Magic Golden Stone was blocked by the building. They were really wondering how far Luo Luo Zheng could have pushed the stone out without being blocked.</p>

  <p>Who knew! Maybe even eight hundred feet!</p>

  <p>Or even a thousand feet!</p>

  <p>Or even two thousand feet?</p>

  <p>No doubt that it was a record that had never been seen before and probably would never be seen again on this land.</p>

  <p>"Alright! Next!" Chapman waved his hand and started his announcement outshouting the roaring of the crowd. The shock on his face gradually disappeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's performance had made him feel relieved and let go of his previous worries. He felt Luo Luo Zheng had been sent from the fate to help the Collapsing Mountain race. Now that Luo Luo Zheng had visited the prophet, further steps would depend on the prophet's instructions.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was led by a kid of the Collapsing Mountain race, passing by the row of rough buildings.</p>

  <p>The buildings of the Collapsing Mountain race were built with the Silver Astral Stones randomly, and due to this, they had no characteristics that would attract the eyes. As it was forbidden for foreign warriors to enter the living area of the race, Luo Luo Zheng could only cast a quick glance at the buildings, but it was quite obvious to him that the cultural heritage of the race was inferior, nothing entertaining here.  No wonder the children of the race were so easily attracted to the gadgets used by the warriors of the other races.</p>

  <p>He followed the road among the residential quarters until he reached the end of the road where there was a tall building.</p>

  <p>Entering this building, Luo Luo Zheng saw tombstones next to each other, made of Silver Astral Stones.</p>

  <p>'Is this building the burial chamber of the Collapsing Mountain race?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng marveled staring at the silent stones.</p>

  <p>After passing by numerous silver tombstones, he found hundreds of golden tombstones in the chamber, made of Magic Golden Stones, exactly the same material he had pushed forward.</p>

  <p>The old man had revealed it to him that these Magic Golden Stones were rare treasures, but all of them were used as tombstones. These were probably the tombs of previous leaders of the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>There were only around two to three hundred of these precious golden tombstones.</p>

  <p>After passing by the golden tombstones, Luo Luo Zheng finally arrived at the end of the building, where he found a circular tent.</p>

  <p>The tent flap was opened, and a spotless white cloth was spread out on the ground, on which an abnormally tall and skinny old man was sitting.</p>

  <p>This old man clearly belonged to the Collapsing Mountain race too.</p>

  <p>However, he must be quite old, near his passing away from this world.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the Five Aging Processes didn't exist in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. Perhaps this old man was already a dying one, but he was totally not filthy and his face and eyes were still brightened by spirit.</p>

  <p>"Young man, please come closer."</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng was approaching him, the old man urged him to come closer in a hoarse voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded obediently and stepped into the tent.</p>

  <p>The old man extended his skinny arm that looked like a bamboo pole, and pointed towards the side of the white cloth showing Luo Luo Zheng where to sit down.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sat down carefully, cross-legged and facing to the old man.</p>

  <p>After he sat down, the old man remained silent and it made him confused, because he knew that this oldster was undoubtedly the prophet of the Collapsing Mountain race. 'He was the one who wanted me to come here and now he doesn't say a word. Why is he doing this?' wondered Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was sitting there patiently, still cross-legged and waiting for the prophet's action. After some time, he felt that his entire body got slowly relaxed.</p>

  <p>After that punch he had just thrown out, Luo Luo Zheng had gained a new level of insight into power.</p>

  <p>Especially the power coming from his inner world.</p>

  <p>Now that he was able to turn that tremendous force into a glove, would he be able to transform the same power into a sword in the future? Even into a thin awl?</p>

  <p>It was such a pity that he couldn't try out his suspicions in front of this prophet, and could only restrain his desire.</p>

  <p>After a long time, the prophet finally started speaking. "We are attached to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, and this land is attached to the divine land. It is well-known that the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land is moving eight trillion miles a day."</p>

  <p>"Huh?" Luo Luo Zheng got slightly startled as he heard the prophet's words.</p>

  <p>The old prophet said slowly, "The entire divine land is spinning with high speed and falling into the depths of the chaos. But we cannot feel it, even though we are inside it."</p>

  <p>After the prophet's explanation, Luo Luo Zheng was still confused a bit.</p>

  <p>He was able to comprehend some of the prophet's words. He grasped that it did not matter if someone was in a universe or the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. These places were the inner worlds of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The inner worlds of these Holy Beings revolved around the divine land that was also rotating at an extremely high speed.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors in the inner worlds did not feel the movements at all.</p>

  <p>For example, a star rotated, but the creatures on the star would not be able to feel this constant rotation of the star.</p>

  <p>But what did the prophet mean by "falling into the depths of the chaos?"</p>

  <p>The old man continued, "All of the Holy Beings state that the chaos is endless. It doesn't matter how deep the inner worlds fall, they cannot fall to the bottom. However, being one of the three new Holy Beings, our master knows there is a boundary to the chaos. The divine land cannot descend endlessly, and when it reaches that boundary, it causes a final crash and then the True Gods are annihilated."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was astonished and he asked eventually, "And what is my connection with all this?"</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on the prophet's face and he said, "There aren't many people in the divine land who agree with this view, but my master is one of them, so he gave up on building an entire universe and instead created the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land with all his might."</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Luo Zheng finally realized that the "master" this prophet mentioned must be the Holy Being who had built the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The strength source that Luo Luo Zheng had been able to imbibe was also the strength source of that Holy Being.</p>

  <p>"Other than you and me, no one from the Collapsing Mountain race knows about this matter," the prophet murmured. "Our master hopes that his power will be shared among all the living beings and one day a mighty warrior could be born. He is hoping that this mighty warrior will be able to support the divine land and stop it from falling to the depths of chaos."</p>

  <p>"Why are you telling it to me?" asked Luo Luo Zheng, blinking his eyes.</p>

  <p>The prophet just smiled and gave a short answer. "Because you have taken too much strength source."</p>
