<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Seven-Star Province was vast. Though there were over a dozen big cities developed by the Sword Light Palace, the other parts of it were covered with vast jungles.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Falling from the sky, Zheng broke an ancient huge tree in his track.</p>

  <p>Surviving the fall, Zheng stood firmly on the thick leaves.</p>

  <p>Fallen leaves piled all over the ground, making the air smell rotten. The jungle was filled with sounds of little animals running around.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>Following Zheng, some other disciples also fell into this area.</p>

  <p>Having the same thought as Zheng, they wanted to hide in the jungle and escape from this disaster.</p>

  <p>Bang! Hearing the loud sound from far away, these disciples were dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>A violent impact wave spread out in all directions, destroying all the towering trees and shrubs. Soon after, it left an empty ground within ten miles.</p>

  <p>A Black Armor warrior stood thousands of feet away from Zheng.</p>

  <p>Having one of his arms cut off by Zheng, the warrior was in a state of rage.</p>

  <p>With his other hand drooping on the ground, he walked slowly towards Zheng just like a gorilla, while commenting in an influent way, "You're truly worthy of your reputation as a disciple from the Sword Light Palace. You can hurt me even without reaching the Other Shore Realm. It's really surprising!"</p>

  <p>Watching from afar, Kenelm, Beldene and the rest spoke with Zheng, almost at the same time, through their life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Zheng! Run!"</p>

  <p>"He's going to kill you!"</p>

  <p>Hearing their reminders, Zheng only revealed a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>Of course, he knew that he was being targeted by the Black Armor warrior.</p>

  <p>It was not the first time that someone of the Other Shore Realm chased him.</p>

  <p>But he felt the greatest pressure this time.</p>

  <p>As the Black Armor warrior approached him, his Truth of Godly Way slowly appeared, forming a shield on the surface of his body.</p>

  <p>"The Other Shore Token of this Black Armor warrior is a shield." Zheng's eyes narrowed in trepidation, seeing the shield.</p>

  <p>He decided to employ the Grand Teleportation technique, seeing that the Black Armor warrior was only two thousand feet away from him.</p>

  <p>Noticing that the space channel was about to come into shape, the Black Armor warrior sped up significantly. With his strength, he lunged with an attempt to kill Zheng before he could escape using the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's act obviously exceeded the Black Armor warrior's expectations. He didn't plan to escape through Grand Teleportation at all.</p>

  <p>Instead, Zheng abruptly retreated backward like a bolt of lightning, as the space fluctuation spread in the air.</p>

  <p>All thanks to Zheng's deceptive movement, the Black Armor warrior pounced quickly and smashed a large crater in the ground, missing his target.</p>

  <p>"What a cunning brat!" he said, gritting his teeth.</p>

  <p>Missing the first attack, the Black Armor warrior continued to chase after Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the distance, Beldene, Kenelm and the rest felt worried about Zheng as they watched the chase.</p>

  <p>"This monster is too fast!"</p>

  <p>"Well, he is at the Other Shore Realm. I'm afraid he will catch Zheng sooner or later."</p>

  <p>As the chase went on, the distance between Zheng and the Black Armor warrior was getting closer.</p>

  <p>In less than ten seconds, the Black Armor warrior was able to close their distance to only thirty feet.</p>

  <p>"He's faster than I expected!"</p>

  <p>Though slightly shocked, Zheng was expecting a strong opponent.</p>

  <p>After all, the Other Shore Realm was a totally different level. With his current strength, fighting the Other Shore Realm warriors was too difficult for him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Hearing a whistling sound from behind him, Zheng had no time to look back at all. However, he had been observing his surrounding with his spiritual sense all the time. As if he had eyes on his back, he gently twisted his shoulders, dodging to the other side without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng avoided the attack, the Black Armor warrior's long hand suddenly came at his waist, twisting like a snake.</p>

  <p>"What? His hand!"</p>

  <p>Shocked, Zheng realized that he made a mistake.</p>

  <p>Although the Black Armor race members had hands and feet, and they looked like larger-sized humans, they were completely different from the human race. Their arms had no joints, so they could twist them at will, launching an attack from an unexpected direction.</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, Zheng exerted all his strength, activating the Truth of Cultivation Nature. With his entire body being as nimble as a mouse, he tried to escape the grasp of the Black Armor warrior.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng's move caught the Black Armor warrior unprepared. He thought that since Zheng was a disciple of the Sword Light Palace, he would be practicing only the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. After all, this was not the first fight between the Black Armor race and the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Twisting his body smoothly, Zheng managed to escape.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Zheng lifted his sword, exerting the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>At such a close distance, Zheng's Ways-blending Strike hit the Black Armor warrior directly.</p>

  <p>But as soon as his sword reached his opponent, a shield shadow suddenly emerged from the surface of the latter's body.</p>

  <p>With the help of the shield shadow, the Black Armor warrior was able to withstand the blow.</p>

  <p>The sword in Zheng's hand broke into pieces, but the explosion of the Ways-blending Energy created a huge impact force, pushing the Black Armor warrior several thousand feet away from him. Zheng retreated towards the other direction, increasing the distance between them.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng was safe, Kenelm felt overjoyed, "Good job, Zheng!"</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Beldene still felt worried, "He needs to move faster to lose him and escape. He needs to find a way to get rid of his enemy."</p>

  <p>Just as Beldene concluded, the Black Armor warrior was more infuriated after being pushed away. Letting out an angry roar, he chased after Zheng again at a double speed.</p>

  <p>He began to view Zheng as a worthy enemy this time.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, they had both rushed into the depths of the jungle.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Truth of Cultivation Nature, Zheng moved through the dense bushes as quickly as a monkey.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Black Armor warrior dashed forward, breaking every towering tree in his path and leaving everything in a mess.</p>

  <p>After running about ten thousand feet, Zheng suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>Not knowing what Zheng was up to, the Black Armor warrior also stopped not far away from him. "Are you going to surrender?" he asked with a sinister grin.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't respond. Flicking his finger, another long sword suddenly appeared in his hand.</p>

  <p>The Black Armor warrior stood in awe.</p>

  <p>Although most races other than the humans didn't use swords as weapons, the Soaring Snake Sword's brilliance was too obvious. The Black Armor warrior might not know swords well, but he could tell that Zheng's sword had an extraordinary background. It was probably a peerless weapon.</p>

  <p>"That looks like a good sword. Ha-ha! If I bring that booty back home, I will obtain a lot of rewards," the Black Armor warrior said with excitement.</p>

  <p>Seeing that his enemy was ready to launch another attack, Zheng started to recite the Imperial Sword Seal. The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent in his body constantly gathered in the attack he was preparing.</p>

  <p>Soon, Zheng felt a burning sensation on his chest, as a dark golden light shot into the Soaring Snake Sword.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng felt the Soaring Snake Sword in his hand had come to life.</p>
