<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had learned from Yolande that most warriors had spent tens of thousands of years on this island, observing and gaining insights.</p>

  <p>But after learning that Damian had studied it for twenty thousand years, Luo Zheng could not help but marvel at that!</p>

  <p>The scenery of this Willow Island was pretty good. No matter what, staying there for twenty thousand years meant that one would have to face the expansive and bare rock all those years. One could almost imagine just how boring it was!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to look at Landry and asked, "What about you?"</p>

  <p>Landry chuckled and proudly stretched out his fingers. "Sixty thousand years..."</p>

  <p>Sixty thousand years!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was merely in his twenties. But Landry had stayed there for sixty thousand years only to observe and to try to unravel the mysteries left behind by Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>Landry, who seemed to be accustomed to the shocked expressions of others, softly chuckled. "Sixty thousand years is nothing. Previously, there was an old fellow who stayed here for one hundred and thirty thousand years. But after breaking into the Five Aging Processes, he returned. Perhaps he has died already..."</p>

  <p>The two of them had no ill intentions at all and were even quite friendly to Luo Zheng. It was only after their conversation that they understood that Luo Zheng had come to participate in the Passing the Torch.</p>

  <p>"Since you can participate in the Passing the Torch, you must be a warrior, who is highly valued by the thirteen palaces. There would still be a long way to go in your life, so I suggest that you should not contemplate at the stone. That particular stone has a kind of enchanting magic, and once you are obsessed with it, you will be unable to extricate yourself from it without difficulty. I'm afraid that you will also waste your time on it like us by then," Landry warned.</p>

  <p>"Since you know that it is just a waste of time, why haven't you left?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't stop himself probing out of his curiosity.</p>

  <p>A bitter smile crept on Damian's face when he heard Zheng's words. "Ha-ha. We have spent all these years here, but now you want us to leave?</p>

  <p>Doesn't it mean that all my previous efforts will be wasted?"</p>

  <p>"If truth be told, we also know that we can't obtain anything here, but so what if we refuse to leave? We can no longer engage in accomplishing some things and make great achievements in other respects too. So, we might as well hold on, and die here," Landry disclosed as he smiled helplessly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't been able to fathom it before. Since those warriors couldn't succeed in obtaining Supreme Lord Sword's inheritance, they could give up on it, but sadly, they didn't choose to give up. Now, he could deeply perceive how their mindsets worked.</p>

  <p>On the path of martial arts, 'perseverance' was fundamentally the most important thing. A warrior, who could persist and endure, had firm determination and was highly resolute that he could succeed. Landry and Damian were both Spirit Supreme Realm warriors. Being inherently powerful, they could lead a decent life in high status in any sacred place of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, the strength of will of these two definitely would never be weak.</p>

  <p>However, they had to find the right course to persist. If they maintained the wrong direction, they would be able to get further and further away from their goals.</p>

  <p>Landry and Damian fully knew that they were already in the wrong, but they had ignored it and continued to persist for too long. They had journeyed too far on this wrong route and were no longer able to turn back.</p>

  <p>After hearing the warning from the two seniors, Luo Zheng smiled and nodded.</p>

  <p>"I understand. I merely pass by, and I am suddenly curious. I want to give it a try!"</p>

  <p>"That's good!" Damian shook his head. And with a flip of his body, he quickly sat down in a large pit, causing the entire pit to sink ten-feet deep into the ground. Due to friction, its wall had become smooth resembling a mirror, and Damian looked like he was inserted to it.</p>

  <p>This was the pit that Damian had quietly sat in to meditate for twenty thousand years!</p>

  <p>Landry's figure also flashed as he sat down in another pit, staring at that huge stone with his eyes wide open as if he was battling with someone else. In an instant, the two of them had already entered a meditative state!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled slightly and raised his head to look at the huge stone again.</p>

  <p>After over one minute, some faint white sword shadows appeared in front of Zheng's eyes again!</p>

  <p>As he became more and more focused, these sword shadows were also getting more and more real!</p>

  <p>At the start, there were just the white sword shadows, but after fifteen minutes, the sword shadows were already like real swords.</p>

  <p>As these sword shadows became more real, Luo Zheng had the stronger feeling of being pierced when the sword shadows stabbed into his body and caused his heart to increasingly ache.</p>

  <p>But in fact it was just an illusion, and his body wasn't injured at all! Luo Zheng also tried to remind himself that it was just an illusion.</p>

  <p>However, this did not seem to be of any use. The pain seemed to be real.</p>

  <p>And every time a sword shadow stabbed into his body, it would make his heart twitch as if a sword was really thrust into him, but he wasn't injured.</p>

  <p>"No..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed. He was firmly set that he could not let these white sword shadows bring him any pain!</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Zheng turned over and took out his Thunder Wind Divine Sword. Bracing himself, he faced the incoming white sword shadows, and suddenly swung his sword through the air!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's sword intent swiftly erupted from the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a very strange scene appeared. One white sword shadow directly swallowed Zheng's sword intent!</p>

  <p>Afterward, the white sword shadow continued to rush towards Luo Zheng. As he was unable to avoid the attack, the sword shadow went straight into his body!</p>

  <p>"Puff"</p>

  <p>At that moment, a muffled sound came from within Zheng's body, and subsequently, he felt a sweet sensation in his throat as he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng was indeed injured!</p>

  <p>Although Landry and Damian were in a meditative state, their faces both wore strange expressions when they witnessed what had happened to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In front of this massive stone, they had observed many hilarious things that had occurred since then.</p>

  <p>Some warriors swore that they saw the soul of Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>They even pretended to kneel and acknowledge him as their master, talking to him in the air. Some warriors even claimed that they were surrounded by a sword array. As long as they broke the sword array, they would be able to comprehend the swordsmanship of the Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>In short, all sorts of things had taken place there.</p>

  <p>And they had spotted many warriors like Luo Zheng, who incessantly waved their swords in front of the big words on the giant stone!</p>

  <p>Many warriors performed in front of the massive stone to show their swordsmanship. They seemed to want to use their skills to break the mystery of Supreme Lord Sword. However, in the end, it was proved to be their only wishful thinking.</p>

  <p>But now, Landry and Damian were curious as to why Luo Zheng was injured.</p>

  <p>How did he get hurt?</p>

  <p>The brush strokes reflected from the poem on the giant stone indeed made warriors feel very uncomfortable. But they would only feel that way and would not be injured. Those who were not accustomed to them, on the other hand, would even become restless when facing those words.</p>

  <p>But, once they got used to them, they would not have that terrible feeling anymore.</p>

  <p>How could anyone be hurt in this case?</p>

  <p>But it was incontestable that Luo Zheng vomited blood!</p>

  <p>"This guy seems to be playing some tricks."</p>

  <p>"He might have deliberately injured himself, but what's the use of playing this trick in front of us?"</p>

  <p>The two of them quietly talked through the life vitality. They had encountered all kinds of things there before. They could be considered as the experienced elites. But after making a random deduction, they believed that Luo Zheng only pretended to do that in front of them and that he had purposefully spat out blood.</p>

  <p>They nonetheless failed to understand that there was no need for Luo Zheng to act like that in front of them. They had spent their entire lives there and it was of no value. Even though Zheng's cultivation level was not high, he still had the qualifications to participate in the Passing the Torch, which meant that he was one of the remarkable warriors of thirteen palaces and that he would surely have a promising future. Thus he didn't need to deceive Landry and Damian.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was naturally not clear about the thoughts of these two warriors, but his face revealed an unconvinced expression.</p>

  <p>He had just released a strand of sword intent, but it was swallowed again by the white sword shadow. Moreover, when the sword intent bounced back, it actually injured him, which meant that he was hurt by his own sword intent!</p>

  <p>"Again!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng did not send out the sword intent. Instead, he wrapped the sword intent around Thunder Wind Divine Sword. And he patiently waited for the white sword shadow to approach. Then, he hit it with his sword!</p>

  <p>That white sword shadow was still an illusion, so when the two swords clashed, there was no sound at all. But this time, Zheng's sword directly deflected the white sword shadow, but the white sword shadow circled and shot into Zheng's body again!</p>

  <p>'I can't block it, and it seems to be useless for me to do that, ' Luo Zheng thought, frowning. It seemed that even if he saw the white sword shadow, he wouldn't be able to do anything with it!</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, this time, Luo Zheng was not injured.</p>
