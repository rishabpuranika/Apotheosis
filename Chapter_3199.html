<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3199 Sun Fiend Wheel </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Grayson rubbed his eyes hard in disbelief, his heart seeming to have stopped.</p>

  <p>He couldn't move. He stared in shock at the blood spreading across the water. It was true; this was reality. Lazlo, his elder brother, who had been talking happily with him and Drystan a moment ago, was now dead.</p>

  <p>"W-what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Marco asked in a weak voice, floating on the surface of the water. He was trembling terribly.</p>

  <p>"Lazlo is dead. He was killed by that guy!" Grayson said furiously, his face menacing.</p>

  <p>Marco was stunned for a second. He couldn't believe what he just heard.</p>

  <p>"It's impossible..."</p>

  <p>"I will avenge my brother!"</p>

  <p>Drystan jumped out of the water surface, and an impossibly huge wheel appeared on his back. The wheel started emitting a dazzling light, so bright it was almost impossible to look directly at it.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a golden copper stick suddenly appeared in his hand!</p>

  <p>"Sun Fiend Wheel! Spin!"</p>

  <p>Under Drystan's command, the wheel rapidly spun on its own.</p>

  <p>After a while, it finally stopped.</p>

  <p>The wheel had six different patterns. A totem like a fiend statue stopped above Drystan's head when it was done spinning.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the aura enveloping his entire body changed immensely.</p>

  <p>It was like he was possessed by a fiend, slowly becoming evil and powerful.</p>

  <p>The Sun Fiend Wheel was a special kind of Other Shore Token within Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore. It had a total of six different forms. Every time it was activated, the chosen form would possess the warrior's body.</p>

  <p>Some forms were powerful enough to make the warrior become indestructible, while others were only supportive.</p>

  <p>Whether the opponent would encounter a powerful form or a weak one from the wheel, it was entirely up to their luck.</p>

  <p>"You are unlucky. Perhaps my brother's still protecting me. This is my most powerful form!"</p>

  <p>Three sharp horns suddenly appeared on Drystan's head, growing slowly to their full lengths. Then blood vessels in his entire body started becoming visible, emitting a bright red light!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood unmoving on the surface of the water, his eyes narrowed slightly, assessing the situation. He released his truth aura quietly and unnoticed.</p>

  <p>Even though he had already killed Lazlo, he couldn't let his guard down even for just a second.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been able to kill Lazlo because he caught him off guard. On the other hand, Drystan and Grayson had already surpassed the Lust World, and their strength shouldn't be underestimated.</p>

  <p>As Drystan swung his long stick in a swift long arc, more than a hundred brisk water tornadoes rose on the surface of the lake.</p>

  <p>The long stick abruptly stopped on its movement, and all the water tornadoes were split in half in an instant.</p>

  <p>Countless splashes of water wound around him, covering his entirety.</p>

  <p>When the splashes dissipated, Drystan was gone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared vigilantly ahead, keeping his senses alert as he looked for any trace of Drystan. He suddenly felt a stirring of space fluctuation from behind him.</p>

  <p>'He is behind me!'</p>

  <p>But before Luo Zheng could turn even his head, there was already a whistling sound and a loud crack as the stick struck his back with a powerful blow.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>With his current physical body, at most Drystan could withstand a force of six to seven hundred Jun. However, after the fiend in the Sun Fiend Wheel possessed his body, there was an apparent increase in his physical strength. The stick he was carrying might unleash a force of a thousand Jun!</p>

  <p>If it struck any other Other Shore Realm cultivator, their internal organs would turn into pieces and their body would probably be cut in two by the stick!</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng was unable to withstand and counter its attack!</p>

  <p>"Shade Stone!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried his best with his remaining strength to mobilize the Shade Stone liquid to accumulate on his back.</p>

  <p>His back turned dark in an instant. The Shade Stone liquid not only protected his spine, but also his ribs and internal organs, keeping them all in place.</p>

  <p>However, the impact was still as powerful as Luo Zheng had predicted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng fell like a heavy meteor, smashing into the mud at the bottom of the Clear Lake.</p>

  <p>The massive lake water was squeezed and spread around. The water turned into a huge wave over a thousand feet high, shadowing over everything and everyone around the lake. Many onlookers fled, while the top warriors of the clans living around Clear Lake moved to do something to stop the huge waves from crossing the shore.</p>

  <p>Drystan held the long stick tightly, his anger as disturbed as the water below. He looked solemnly at the bottom of the lake, the point where Luo Zheng fell terribly.</p>

  <p>When he could finally see Luo Zheng clearly from below, he was surprised.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng should have been turned into ashes after receiving such an overwhelming attack. Instead, he seemed unharmed. What kind of monster was he?</p>

  <p>A moment ago, Drystan couldn't understand how Lazlo had died at Luo Zheng's hands. He estimated that Luo Zheng wasn't all that powerful from the way he looked. But now, it was clear and he understood.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng slowly rose from the mud almost immediately after his fall, and he looked completely unscathed.</p>

  <p>The heads of the clans stared at him in shock.</p>

  <p>They believed that the attack from Drystan carried a force of at least eight hundred Jun.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng seemed to have suffered no injury from it.</p>

  <p>Was he even a human?</p>

  <p>It was proven difficult even for the innate strong creatures from Cyan Scale race or Huge Crab race to do that.</p>

  <p>"Let's see how long you can keep up!" Hate filled Drystan's eyes as he disappeared once again from his position.</p>

  <p>The competition in Vastness Mountain's intelligence agency was extremely cruel.</p>

  <p>The reason Drystan and Grayson were able to achieve what they were today was because of Lazlo's wisdom. The three brothers loved and looked out for each other. And now that Lazlo was dead, Drystan and Grayson both went mad with fury, wreaking havoc.</p>

  <p>Once again, Drystan appeared behind Luo Zheng out of thin air.</p>

  <p>His stick came crashing down towards him, more powerful than the previous one.</p>

  <p>But this time, Luo Zheng was prepared. He whipped around in the air as soon as he could feel Drystan and dodged away by a hair's breadth. At the same time, a white light flashed in his right eye.</p>

  <p>Drystan's Chaotic Source Reinforcement wasn't as powerful as Lazlo's, but thanks to the fiend form of the Sun Fiend Wheel, his body had become stronger with fewer physical defects.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body shuttled through the shadows of Drystan's stick, his eyes firmly staring at Drystan, watching out for his next move.</p>

  <p>Under the fury in his heart, Drystan gave Luo Zheng a swift sweep. However, when he was stared at directly like this by Luo Zheng, he actually felt a little scared!</p>

  <p>"Shadowless Broken Sticks!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>The endless stick shadows surrounded Luo Zheng, and almost each of them charged at his vital parts at the same time, making it harder to dodge.</p>

  <p>At this time, the white light in Luo Zheng's eye flashed more dangerously, and Drystan trembled.</p>

  <p>When people were angry, they could overcome fear and rise more powerful than before.</p>

  <p>The death of Lazlo infuriated Drystan greatly. The effect of the demonic eye on him was reduced significantly.</p>

  <p>But life and death could be decided in a second in a fight between powerhouses.</p>

  <p>Drystan was caught in fright for only the blink of an eye. But that was long enough for Luo Zheng, who had been watching him intently, to find his weakness.</p>

  <p>'Finally, I can see it clearly. It's in his chest...'</p>

  <p>With only his target in mind, Luo Zheng swung his sword with minimal power.</p>

  <p>He didn't have to use much strength.</p>

  <p>That attack carried only a force of fifty to sixty Jun.</p>

  <p>If the sword had stabbed other parts of Drystan's body, it wouldn't even be able to break the protection of his fiend form.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng saw it. Two inches to the right corner of his chest was Drystan's biggest weakness.</p>

  <p>Three cracks started spreading down his chest, two downwards and another upward. Slowly, as the cracks extended throughout his body, Drystan's whole form turned into tiny little pieces like a broken porcelain.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng raised his hand gently, the sword radiance rushed out and charged at Drystan. When his body was successfully broken, his soul was destroyed by the sword radiance with a final strike.</p>
