</p>

  <p>Now, though, Zheng's soul was fuller and stronger after having absorbed so much soul power. A glimmer of glazed light could be seen shining on the surface of his soul. Although Zheng hadn't released any soul pressure now, the aura hidden in his soul caused Master Evil to feel an invisible pressure.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, your soul seems to be getting closer and closer to that of a consummate True God's. Is it about to become the Soul of Light?"</p>

  <p>Master Evil couldn't stop himself from asking this question.</p>

  <p>"The Soul of Light?" Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>Master Evil nodded and replied, "The soul of a consummate True God is called the Soul of Light."</p>

  <p>If a True God wanted to reach the consummation of True God Realm, they had to grasp the consummate theurgy of a Godly Way. The seventh stage of each Godly Way was very powerful, and thus, a consummate True God's combat power would be enhanced to a level higher than that of a top-rank True God!</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, a consummate True God still experienced certain weaknesses, in both soul and body.</p>

  <p>Certain True Gods would try to make up for these two shortcomings after they had reached the consummation of True God Realm. They would cultivate in order to form Nine Divine Stars, which meant the consummation of their physical body. When their soul became the Soul of Light, it was considered as their soul's consummation.</p>

  <p>"It is said that after becoming the Soul of Light, one's soul will change from dark to light, as if it was experiencing rebirth. Such a soul doesn't fear lightning or any method of exorcism, for that matter," Master Evil added.</p>

  <p>Even a True God Soul was still a Soul of Darkness. It came down to the same thing as the evil spirits and ghost souls. They were all considered Souls of Darkness, and such souls were extremely fragile. If lightning got into the mind of a True God with such a soul, the soul would still be severely damaged.</p>

  <p>In addition, this kind of soul could be wiped out through a specific purifying theurgy.</p>

  <p>However, once one's soul became a Soul of Light, the soul would go through significant change. Just as Master Evil had said, a Soul of Light was like a newborn body, and thus, it wasn't yet terribly afraid of the power from thunder and lightning. In fact, once it escaped the brain, the soul could be even seen with the naked eye.</p>

  <p>"So that's how it's going to be," Zheng said as he nodded his head briskly.</p>

  <p>After absorbing the soul power, he did feel that his soul had an unprecedented sense of fulfillment. The void that had been gradually emitting from his soul dissipated, as if all of a sudden, his soul had become a substance.</p>

  <p>'I wonder how I would feel if my soul were to become a Soul of Light?' he thought to himself. 'If I activate the Emotion Closing Godly Way with the Soul of Light, will the unleashed soul pressure be even more powerful?' he continued wondering.</p>

  <p>As he thought this over, Zheng felt a little pity. He had killed all the Soul-killing Ghosts. If only there were another final group of them, wouldn't that be great?</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>At the exact moment, the valley began to shake once again, and the sixth wave of fierce beasts began to attack.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, the True Gods who had, until then, maintained their silence were also in a tumult.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to defend this round!" one of them shouted.</p>

  <p>"Even if the supreme treasure of belief appears, I don't want anything to do with this anymore. If I keep on fighting, I'm just looking for death..." someone else added.</p>

  <p>"If you still want to fight, I'm sorry that I can't keep you company!" another True God agreed.</p>

  <p>The Soul-killing Ghosts had already taken the lives of dozens of True Gods, but the survivors had gained nothing from it. It was only inevitable that they wanted to retreat.</p>

  <p>They all left through the Star Door without hesitation. Their only intention now was to save their lives.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, more than half of the three hundred True Gods were gone. There were only seventy, maybe eighty True Gods that had stayed behind.</p>

  <p>"What do we do now? Do we defend?" Soren asked calmly.</p>

  <p>Reginald looked at the four entrances located at the end of the valley. A bitter smile was plastered on his face. "I don't think we can... There are too few of us. We are outnumbered by the beasts. We can't take them on..."</p>

  <p>Following Reginald's gaze, the other True Gods looked in the same direction and saw huge golden turtles slowly crawling out from all directions.</p>

  <p>Their thick limbs stomped on the ground, leaving behind numerous circular pits. Despite crawling very slowly, there were too many of them to count.</p>

  <p>"Golden Shell Turtles," Soren confirmed, shaking his head expressionlessly. "They are the fourth-grade beasts in the Everest Spirit Mountain. They're strong enough to rebound attacks. In the end, we really can't deal with this kind of beast right now."</p>

  <p>"Let's go," Bevan stated without second thought. Since they couldn't deal with the coming beasts, the only remaining choice for them now was to retreat— just like the others did earlier.</p>

  <p>Seeing as the other top-rank True Gods had all made their decisions, the True Gods from the Han Clan, the Mu Clan and other clans sitting on the fence, didn't hesitate any longer.</p>

  <p>A look of regret spread across Reginald's face. He could only shake his head and walk solemnly toward the Star Door.</p>

  <p>It was at that exact moment, though, that the light in the center of the Star Door began to ripple slightly. Barely noticeable, but it did.</p>

  <p>In a panic, a low-rank True God rushed out from the Star Door. His face was filled with fear, and he was moving very fast. He collided with Reginald at once.</p>
