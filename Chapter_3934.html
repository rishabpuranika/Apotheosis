<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The battle of the Li Shan mountain had shocked the Source World.</p>

  <p>There was an old belief that the Other Shore always had an impact on the chaos. For instance, both the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race supported some powerful races in the chaos.</p>

  <p>However, their strategies were always subtle. The power of the Other Shore had never been directly exerted on the chaos.</p>

  <p>The chaos had always been governed by the lucky Chaos Ancient Gods and the ruling forces.</p>

  <p>But this time, the tables had turned? the rules had undergone a fundamental change.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven of the Nihility race had personally descended into the chaos, and Claire of the Element Spirit Civilization had also participated in the battle. They were existences that could not only defeat but also put the Chaos Ancient Gods to their death.</p>

  <p>The insurmountable wall between the Other Shore and the chaos had been torn down!</p>

  <p>Warriors at the Eternal Realm of superpowers and the top ten ferocious beasts of the chaos had once been considered powerhouses for dominating a part in the chaos. However, when compared to the powerful warriors of the Other Shore, they were no match. They had inferior strength incomparable to theirs.</p>

  <p>The attitude of some super forces such as the Separate Abyss race had always been ambiguous. They would not choose side until one of the Purge Way and the Finale Way clearly gained the upper hand.</p>

  <p>In the battle of the Li Shan mountain, Claire was defeated and the Chaos Ancient Gods, Herbert, and Lamont had unfortunately died. The Bearing race, which appeared to be extremely powerful, faced a crushing failure. The Li Shan mountain destroyed the two Chaos Ancient Gods, and on top of that, they had killed the Grandmaster of Heaven behind the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>Many of the ruling civilizations reacted quickly even as they were still in a state of shock...</p>

  <p>These Eternal Realm warriors were only opportunists, but as the main force that supported the Finale Way, the Li Shan mountain had to fight against the joined forces of the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race. There was no point in refusing these super forces that willingly crossed over to their side.</p>

  <p>It was unrealistic to expect these forces to help them fight against the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization, yet it was enough that they would not fight the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Not long after Luo Zheng and the others returned to the Li Shan mountain, Kendrick also arrived.</p>

  <p>He was the third Chaos Ancient God that supported the Finale Way. He was a creature that resembled a black turtle; his movements were considered slowest among the six Chaos Ancient Gods. When he had finally reached the chaos, the war had already ended.</p>

  <p>Among the six Chaos Ancient Gods, Othniel mastered the truth about space, Gerald the truth about life, Herbert the truth about confinement, Lamont the truth about temperature, and Judson the truth about creation.</p>

  <p>The truth that Kendrick, the last one of them, grasped was defense.</p>

  <p>Compared to the first five Chaos Ancient Gods, Kendrick's attacking power was not too strong, but his defending power was extraordinary among them.</p>

  <p>After Kendrick descended to the Li Shan mountain, he directly entered its inner space. His entire body integrated with the Li Shan mountain, forming the strongest defensive line for it...</p>

  <p>All over the Li Shan mountain, from the Snake Goddess to the mountain leaders, the common members, and the disciples, all proceeded to work, busying themselves in building up the defense.</p>

  <p>No one knew when the next war would break out. They didn't want to be taken by surprise, or be caught unprepared. They could only try their best to contribute to strengthening the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>After returning to the Li Shan mountain, Luo Zheng didn't go to see Yan and his family immediately. Instead, he chose to stay secluded.</p>

  <p>He glanced at a mirror only to be terrified at the sight. The ancestry-level bloodline had transformed his body, almost turning him into a hideous monster.</p>

  <p>Tentacles had grown all over his body and his head was unimaginably horrible. Anyone who faced such a monster would certainly be frightened. 'I have to return to my original appearance, ' he urged himself.</p>

  <p>On the Dark Haze Peak, there was also a young man dressed in cotton robe, together with Luo Zheng. This young man was No. 9527 who had just obtained its freedom.</p>

  <p>However, Gerald was someone who would never set a soul fragment free.</p>

  <p>Normally, a soul fragment like No. 9527 who had formed the consciousness of its own would be retrieved by Gerald himself. But this time, he made an exception. He not only allowed No. 9527 to leave freely but also created a human body for it.</p>

  <p>For No. 9527, the only person in this world it had a connection with was Luo Zheng. Naturally, it chose to follow Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You look mighty with your new look," No. 9527 said with a smile. "And in this form, your strength should be more powerful," he presumed.</p>

  <p>"That's true, but this appearance makes me no longer a human..." Luo Zheng answered, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>The tentacles on his body could not only absorb the Great Sanskrit Light, but they were also capable of acquiring other energy.</p>

  <p>If the Snake Goddess fought with Luo Zheng now, it wouldn't even take a second round for Luo Zheng to completely absorb the shadow of Snake Goddess. Just one round would be enough.</p>

  <p>As No. 9527 said, the combat strength he had in this form appeared to surpass that of his original form?</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter whether you are a human or not," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>As a soul fragment of Gerald, No. 9527 had a unique perspective of life.</p>

  <p>In his opinion, it was not important to maintain the human form.</p>

  <p>"Then why did you take that human form?" asked Luo Zheng with a smile.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was stunned upon hearing his question.</p>

  <p>After staying with Luo Zheng for a long time, No. 9527 began to better understand the human race. Moreover, he wanted to follow Luo Zheng, so he was naturally willing to have a human form.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said no more and once again tried to communicate with the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>It was certain that the ancestry-level bloodline already had its consciousness, but Luo Zheng was unable to tell the level of this consciousness it had reached.</p>

  <p>Did it rely on its instinct to act, or did it have a mind of its own? There was a huge difference between the two?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued to try to communicate with it. His constant persistence from morning until evening had worked; the ancestry-level bloodline finally responded and spared Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Two days later, there was a transformation in Luo Zheng's physical body.</p>

  <p>The tentacles on his body quickly degenerated?his old body and limbs grew out again, forming his normal state.</p>

  <p>Seeing that there was a thin net draped on the surface of his body, Luo Zheng could only smile bitterly. The ancestry-level bloodline had memories, and it was still afraid that Luo Zheng would let out the blood. That was why it left the net on his body.</p>

  <p>Now that his physical body had been restored, Luo Zheng was relieved.</p>

  <p>After he sent the news to the Snake Goddess, she immediately told him that someone wanted to see him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rushed over and was surprised to see that there were already over three hundred people gathered in the hall. Sally and Hutton were among them. He squinted his eyes and recognized the old man in the lead?it was Ambrose!</p>

  <p>Sally, Hutton, and several others of the Nine Li race had followed Luo Zheng and stayed in the Heart Flow Sect. The Taiyi Heaven Palace had moved to the west, and they also entered the Li Shan mountain with the disciples of the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>"Grandpa Amborse!" Luo Zheng's eyes lit up with excitement as he approached.</p>

  <p>Ambrose nodded at Luo Zheng with a relieved smile on his wrinkled face. Beside Ambrose, a skinny middle-aged man stared at Luo Zheng with tearful eyes. "I didn't expect that our Nine Li race would have a chance and that such a character belonged to us..."</p>

  <p>Hearing what this person said, Luo Zheng looked at him from head to toe. This person's aura was extraordinary and he was at the Holy Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at Ambrose with confused eyes, as if asking who the unfamiliar man was. Ambrose cleared his throat and introduced, "This is Tucker, the little brother of Grand Chieftain and I. He is the only powerful warrior that remained in the Nine Li race..."</p>

  <p>Among the nine chiefs, Tucker Li was the only warrior at the Holy Soul Realm that had survived.</p>

  <p>There were several branches of the remaining members of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>The group led by Tucker Li and the one led by Ambrose didn't know about each other's existence. Not long ago, Tucker Li finally found this other branch.</p>

  <p>After knowing what had happened in the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Li Shan mountain, Tucker Li decisively rushed to the Li Shan mountain with all the remaining members from his group.</p>
