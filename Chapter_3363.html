  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, Feng Ge's anger turned into confusion. She was curious as to how Elizabeth knew Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's me," Zheng replied with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>Since he had promised Flamine to protect Feng Ge, he had to take some of the pressure off of her.</p>

  <p>Besides, Elizabeth immediately targeted the Oneness Sky Palace the moment she arrived. It was indeed too much.</p>

  <p>Back then, Zheng had taken the Shade Stone which caused Elizabeth to hold a grudge against him ever since.</p>

  <p>It would've been more acceptable if it was a master like Athemar who had done such a thing, but the person who had snatched the Shade Stone away was a young man, a nobody--and Elizabeth felt greatly ashamed.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he didn't even avoid her at all when he had faced her today.</p>

  <p>Instead, he even had the guts to stand up for Feng Ge and call her a bird. He was too bold!</p>

  <p>"Do you really think? that because someone is protecting you, you can be safe all the time?" she snarled murderously as a scorching soul aura spread from her being.</p>

  <p>In turn, the disciples sitting on the ground stepped back when they sensed her strong aura.</p>

  <p>She was so arrogant and domineering that she completely ignored the leaders of the seven mountains.</p>

  <p>Even the usually calm Athemar looked visibly angry now. He released a sharp soul aura, which turned into a wall in front of the disciples as a response. Then, he declared, "Elizabeth, if you want to make a move, our Oneness Sky Palace is ready for a fight!"</p>

  <p>At that point, Winchell and the elders of the other five mountains started to gather their strength. More and more powerful auras filled the space.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Elizabeth's lips stretched into a thin smile. "We're more than happy to see that the Oneness Sky Palace is ready to fight. Should we find a place then?"</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, the old leader of the Bearing race, a few leaders of the Divine Farmer race and the New Moon race all stepped out and stood beside Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source World hadn't even opened yet, but the atmosphere already became too tense.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, anyone with a keen eye could see that the Oneness Sky Palace was at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>In fact, Eastern Emperor Taiyi had already expected this to happen.</p>

  <p>It became worse especially because Zheng had anonymously destroyed the temple of the Bearing race. Thus, the Bearing race had every reason to hate him to the core and desire to eliminate him as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they had already known that Feng Ge had a physical body on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Now, the truth was they had already discussed their plans for their arrival before they set out. Elizabeth would show up first to provoke them.</p>

  <p>Hopefully the Oneness Sky Palace would bite the bait, as it was exactly what they wanted to see. If they tolerated it, however, then they would've still achieved their goal of discouraging the morale of the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace, and they could just come back to it after they had entered the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>This trip to the Chaotic Source World was also the start of their plan to completely cut ties with the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on inside the human race! They are having an internal conflict?" "I think so! Hahahaha?" A few members of the Separate Abyss race watched them and laughed.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the human race had risen very fast, especially the Bearing race, which had grown to a point that even the Separate Abyss race and other large races had to take them seriously. From the looks of it, the Bearing race simply wanted to get rid of the Oneness Sky Palace as soon as possible--which was what the non-human races wanted as well.</p>

  <p>"It's against the rules to fight here..."</p>

  <p>"As long as Pear Hill doesn't interfere, it doesn't matter what they do."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the Oneness Sky Palace will be doomed!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, Athemar, Winchell, and the rest of them went pale with shock.</p>

  <p>They knew it was not realistic to fight in the Icy Snow Province.</p>

  <p>Left with no choice, the Pear Hill had made the Icy Snow Province a public province. Still, they had set rules when they made the decision.</p>

  <p>One of the rules was that it was forbidden to fight in the Icy Snow Province.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, none of the warriors from the Pear Hill showed up. If Elizabeth and the powerful masters who supported her really made a move now that they were outside the Chaotic Source World, all the Oneness Sky Palace disciples present would probably be killed.</p>

  <p>Even Athemar, Winchell, and the other leaders of the mountains might not be able to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace is very famous and they claim they have the best swordsmanship. But, it's actually a place where all the cowards have gathered. Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>"That human force is made up of a group of weak warriors. What do you expect of them?"</p>

  <p>"They are actually so weak to such an extent. They are simply wasting those tickets! Why don't they just give them to other worthy people?"</p>

  <p>Taunts and jeers from the Bearing race began to fill the air.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace were naturally furious, but they knew better than to refute in such a situation.</p>

  <p>"Now... What do you think about my suggestion?" Elizabeth asked Athemar as she looked at him with a charming smile.</p>

  <p>Just as Athemar was caught in a dilemma, a loud thud interrupted his thoughts. A man suddenly fell from the sky and smashed into the ground.</p>

  <p>The man wore a black cloak and because he crashed against the floor, they couldn't see his face clearly.</p>

  <p>He got up after a few moments and once the crowd had a clear view of him, their curiosity became surprise.</p>

  <p>It was Human Sovereign, Fuxi!</p>

  <p>It was known that he had disappeared from the Source World for a very long time.</p>

  <p>No one knew where he had gone, and someone even asserted that he had died in some place within the chaos.</p>

  <p>No one expected that he would appear on the day when the Chaotic Source World was about to open!</p>

  <p>It wasn't until he stood up straight that everyone noticed that he held a wine jar in his hand. His eyes glazed over and he seemed intoxicated.</p>

  <p>He slowly walked towards Elizabeth's direction. However, he completely ignored her and the powerful masters from the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race who stood behind her.</p>

  <p>"Human Sovereign..." Athemar muttered.</p>

  <p>He looked at Fuxi respectfully and gave him a salute.</p>

  <p>Both Athemar and Winchell were confused. They had no idea what on earth Fuxi was up to.</p>

  <p>Once again, everyone was surprised when Fuxi ignored Athemar and directly went past him. Instead, he took a single step and floated towards Zheng like a ghost. He slung an arm over Zheng's shoulder as he said, "Hey young man, we met again!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had once experienced the powerful strength of this man back when he was in the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Now that he had reached Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore and that his Soul of Light had become more powerful and sensitive, Fuxi still gave him the feeling that his strength was incomparably unfathomable.</p>

  <p>"Yes, what a coincidence!" Zheng replied calmly.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Coincidence? I've been waiting for you all this time, but you are too late. You haven't accepted the Chaotic Source Reinforcement yet. How long are you going to let me wait?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi's question puzzled Zheng. "Why are you waiting for me?" Zheng asked back.</p>

  <p>"Of course, to kill you and replace you when the right time comes," said Fuxi with a grin.</p>

  <p>Despite the smile on Fuxi's face and his drunken state, there was a hint of seriousness in his glassy eyes. Zheng's heart skipped a beat. This fellow didn't seem to be joking.</p>

  <p>Of course, he didn't know Fuxi's long-cherished wish.</p>

  <p>After Fuxi had figured out the Chaos Ancient God's intentions, he began to take Zheng seriously as his target.</p>

  <p>Though Zheng had grown at a very outrageous speed, he was still too slow in Fuxi's eyes.</p>

  <p>The others who were present were dumbfounded, as they had no idea what Fuxi was talking about.</p>

  <p>His strength could definitely allow him to kill Zheng with just one finger, so why would he wait until Zheng had grown really strong?</p>

  <p>Furthermore, even if Zheng would really grow with his power, could he become as powerful as a man like Fuxi in the future?</p>

  <p>Elizabeth and those who stood around her were also baffled. Fuxi appeared so suddenly and unexpectedly, and they didn't know what to do next.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Fuxi turned towards Elizabeth and the others, then said,</p>

  <p>"Remember, I don't care about what you do in the Chaotic Source World, but if anyone dares to fight in the Icy Snow Province, I won't show any mercy."</p>
