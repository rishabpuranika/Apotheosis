<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2047 Expansion </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Now that the Celestial Position's plans had been set, every Supreme Lord present would have a chance to exhibit their actual strengths.</p>

  <p>Nathan was already dead. If Luo Luo Zheng also died, the momentum of the Evolutionary Universe would only get weaker. It was something that the head of the Celestial Position race, Master Feng, had clearly felt.</p>

  <p>It was known that Maha had only used a small portion of the Murphy Universe's momentum to activate the spinulose wood fern. While it was no doubt impressive, Master Feng had actually thought of using the Evolution Lotus Flower to swallow it by force.</p>

  <p>However, he refrained from doing so.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that he didn't care about Luo Zheng's life. In fact, Master Feng knew very well that besides Wynn, Luo Luo Zheng was the most important.</p>

  <p>It was because Luo Zheng's mission wasn't just in the universe alone. His future was in the divine land. Furthermore, the Evolutionary Universe could only survive after Luo Luo Zheng had resolved Mike's contradiction.</p>

  <p>The only thing was that the Evolutionary Universe had to successfully resist the Sacred race's attacks.</p>

  <p>If Master Feng had made a move now, the Sacred race would definitely counterattack. It was certainly not a wise decision to start a battle too quickly.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Sacred race weren't the only ones keeping watch on the war. Their race's True God lurked around as well. However, it was Wynn who needed to deal with them. But if he hadn't even taken action up until now, then Master Feng definitely wouldn't be reckless either.</p>

  <p>The inky black sky glittered with twinkling stars. One dim star among them rotated slowly.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the dim star sat Wynn. His eyes drifted towards Luo Luo Zheng, who was hundreds of millions of miles away from him.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that the Sacred race would use the Heavens-suppressing Object on their first attack," Wynn said with a shake of his head, a trace of helplessness reflected in his eyes. He couldn't help Luo Luo Zheng at this point.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng had to face Maha and the Heavens-suppressing Object on his own.</p>

  <p>"I hope Luo Luo Zheng could win and survive with his own strength..." Wynn mumbled. Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng stood with a troubled look on his face.</p>

  <p>He felt a great pressure weigh him down as the spinulose wood fern suddenly pressed itself hard against him.</p>

  <p>This pressure was far beyond his imagination!</p>

  <p>In the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Luo Luo Zheng had seen and felt the auras of both Holy Jay and Holy Drew.</p>

  <p>Their auras weren't unique to Holy Beings alone. A warrior who had become a True God could have it as well. It was the indistinct momentum that came from one's inner world.</p>

  <p>However, the momentum of the inner world was also divided into different levels. Wynn's own momentum was far inferior to that of a Holy Being. It would be difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to sense it unless he released it on purpose. That was why Luo Luo Zheng hadn't felt anything before when he and Wynn had met for the first time.</p>

  <p>"Crunch, crunch, crunch..."</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Luo Zheng's bones began to constrict because of the immense pressure. His bones rubbed against each other and produced strange sounds, and even his height had decreased by two inches.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before Luo Luo Zheng was groaning in unfathomable pain!</p>

  <p>At the same time, Maha had changed the Space Law of the place once again. The smirk on his face grew broader and broader as he watched Luo Luo Zheng who writhed in pain from his crushing bones.</p>

  <p>"It really is an indestructible physical body! If only I could obtain the same..." Maha exclaimed. He then decided that after the spinulose wood fern had killed Luo Luo Zheng, he would take Luo Zheng's corpse and study it thoroughly.</p>

  <p>He believed that he would unlock secrets behind Luo Zheng's physical vessel.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng had sensed that his physical body had reached its limit. Numerous thoughts raced in his mind before he finally screamed,</p>

  <p>"Redemption Armor!"</p>

  <p>The Redemption Armor could change its shape according to the wearer's will. At that moment, Luo Zheng's long robe rapidly changed its shape. It extended from his chest and wrapped around his head, while its cuffs and lower hem elongated as well.</p>

  <p>Its texture began to change too. Its previously cloth-like material was now extremely hard and protected Luo Luo Zheng in a thin, eggshell-like membrane.</p>

  <p>According to Holy Drew, this piece of Redemption Armor made from the source of Godly Tile was theoretically indestructible.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had been completely covered by the armor, he suddenly felt the pain from the spinulose wood fern's suppression had been reduced by half. He felt his body relax but before that, his stomach tightened.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the spinulose wood fern's killing power had poured to his belly and in to his inner world!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>An immense unstoppable force rained down the skies of his inner world and smashed everything in the central continent!</p>

  <p>The entire continent was like a mere piece of paper against the strong pounding of the spinulose wood fern's killing power. The continent split into pieces, and fragments of it were scattered all over the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>A million creatures in his inner world died in a blink of an eye. The divine kingdoms and sacred places had been affected as well. Some of the more powerful martial artists scrambled in panic when they saw the deceptively weak force that came from the sky.</p>

  <p>The overwhelming power of the spinulose wood fern was out to destroy Luo Zheng's inner world!</p>

  <p>"This power..." Luo Luo Zheng muttered with a frown.</p>

  <p>He sent streams of seawater into the air, which he turned into chaotic energy, and then he aimed it towards the incoming killing force.</p>

  <p>Seemingly endless waves of the brown chaotic energy circled continuously around the killing power.</p>

  <p>"Devour!"</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was an omniscient existence within his inner world, he could only neutralize the power that invaded it. He couldn't actually resist it at all.</p>

  <p>He gave the chaotic energy the power to devour and thus, it now converted the killing force into chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>"Rumble, rumble, rumble..."</p>

  <p>However, the killing force was too strong. Even if Luo Luo Zheng controlled the chaotic energy and continuously devoured and converted the killing force, he still wouldn't be able to stop it from destroying his inner world!</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before his belly was an angry red color from the intense pain. His inner world began to show signs of collapse as his face twisted in agony.</p>

  <p>"You can still hold on. I've underestimated you before!"</p>

  <p>"The robe you wear seems great..."</p>

  <p>"Give up. You won't be able to resist this killing power!"</p>

  <p>Maha could clearly see Luo Zheng's changing and conflicting expressions. He understood that Luo Zheng's formidable strength had been exhausted and there was no doubt that he would die this time.</p>

  <p>The spinulose wood fern shook violently again in the air as the light on top of it glowed even brighter. Another wave of its strong killing power rushed towards Luo Luo Zheng. It directly passed through his Redemption Armor and drilled into his belly!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng drew out more and more chaotic energy, but he couldn't convert the killing power at all.</p>

  <p>After the killing power had been condensed in the center of his inner world, it began to expand in all directions? it was about to shatter his whole inner world!</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, a normal world lord's inner world was still quite fragile. Then again, if it had been another warrior, the inner world would've been gone by now.</p>

  <p>The boundary wall of Luo Zheng's inner world was formed from 1, 080 golden Sanskrit words which were connected together. It was an extremely stable wall.</p>

  <p>Yet as the killing power continued to condense, it expanded even further.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't take long before the boundary wall would become unstable.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the 1, 080 Sanskrit words began to vibrate non-stop.</p>

  <p>"This is bad..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart beat erratically in his chest when he felt the changes in his inner world.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Redemption Armor, his physical body could still withstand the killing force. However, it seemed like his inner world couldn't hold on any longer.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the golden Sanskrit words in his inner world glowed brightly.</p>

  <p id="top_10">"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words began to rotate rapidly.</p>

  <p>Each golden Sanskrit word began to split into two golden Sanskrit words, then the two became four, and the four became eight. Finally, each of them was divided into many, and then the words started to fly away from the boundary wall.</p>

  <p>Having lost the support of the golden Sanskrit words, the inner world was now extremely fragile.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the boundary wall crashed like an eggshell that was under a heavy rock!</p>

  <p>All the color from Luo Zheng's face was drained due to the intense pain he felt.</p>

  <p>Yet, the pain was nothing and he could bear it.</p>

  <p>However, the most important body part to a martial artist was the belly.</p>

  <p>To destroy the inner world meant to break the belly, and in turn Luo Luo Zheng would be crippled.</p>

  <p>Just then, a strangely astonishing scene unraveled within Luo Zheng's inner world that had left him dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The golden Sanskrit words that flew everywhere had been connected once again. Moreover, the number of golden Sanskrit words was now multiplied by ten. There were about 10, 800 golden Sanskrit words in total.</p>

  <p>The moment all of them were connected, a faint layer of light appeared and behind it was a new boundary wall.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Luo Zheng's inner world had suddenly expanded tenfold!</p>
