  <p>
</p>

  <p>As he looked at the golden long swords that kept gathering in the sky, Luo Luo Zheng took a deep breath, his muscles tensing up once again.</p>

  <p>These golden swords were condensed by some law, but they did not contain any heavenly essence, which was why Luo Luo Zheng was unable to tell the grade of these swords. But judging by the cold, silver flash of light that emanated from the edges of these swords, it was likely that they had immense power.</p>

  <p>A short while later, the golden cloud moved on its own, despite the absence of wind. With a ringing sound, the first golden sword shot down towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The rest quickly followed.</p>

  <p>The cloud formed by the golden swords transformed into a golden torrent that came surging towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood upright and firmly in his spot like a deep-rooted tree, his feet spread wide. His eyes glittered with a steely resolve as he looked at the golden torrent coming towards him.</p>

  <p>"When I underwent the Metal Tribulation, I wore my Demon Heart Armor and consumed over two hundred thousand supreme life vitality crystals, which was how I managed to survive the Metal Tribulation.</p>

  <p>These swords are much sharper than the swords I've faced before, and this boy doesn't have the Demon Heart Armor to protect him!" the powerful master at the Soul Sea Realm who had gone through the Metal Tribulation shook his head and said.</p>

  <p>The Demon Heart Armor was a semi-divine weapon, an armor used to protect the body. As a defensive weapon, its value was on par with that of the common divine weapons. The powerful master of the Soul Sea Realm who had just spoken had borrowed it from War King Wind when he had to face the Metal Tribulation.</p>

  <p>War King Wind smiled helplessly at the master's words. "If the Demon Heart Armor had still existed, I can lend it to Tianxing. But unfortunately?"</p>

  <p>The fact was that Demon Heart Armor had been destroyed dozens of years ago.</p>

  <p>While they were talking, the golden torrent had already charged towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>'They are coming!'</p>

  <p>As he looked at the first golden sword that was coming at him, Luo Luo Zheng reached out and grabbed it, crushing it into pieces in a flash.</p>

  <p>'This isn't a real sword! It's only condensed from the Metal Law and its strength seems to be inferior to that of a sacred weapon, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>He now knew the power of these swords after he had shattered the first golden sword.</p>

  <p>But in the next moment, the number of golden swords pelting towards Luo Luo Zheng suddenly skyrocketed. He was unable to crush them all with his bare hands. Soon the golden swords came at him from all directions.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was like someone who couldn't swim in a large river and was soon submerged within this golden torrent.</p>

  <p>Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body was as sturdy as a sacred weapon. Every time a golden sword collided with Luo Zheng's body, it would turn into golden powder. The tiny powder quickly turned into bits of Metal Law and dissipated in the air.</p>

  <p>But even though these golden swords were not as strong as Luo Zheng's physical body, the edges of the swords were extremely sharp, and every edge could leave a small scratch on Luo Luo Zheng. As numerous golden swords continued to stab Luo Luo Zheng, the number of scratches left on Luo Zheng's body increased. After a while, it was obvious that the swords had managed to cut open Luo Zheng's skin. Blood began to spurt from the cuts.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sighed softly and closed his eyes, knowing that he had tried his best to resist the swords with his strong physical body.</p>

  <p>Thousands of miles away, in a desolate place in the western part of the Divine Kingdom Continent stood massive towering mountains. Waves of formless sword energy suddenly appeared there and began to invade the vast mountains.</p>

  <p>A mountain that was tens of thousands of feet high began to collapse at a visible speed. It was as if there was a giant invisible mouth that was biting down on the mountain. A few seconds later, the mountain had completely disappeared, as if it hadn't existed at all. All that remained were specks of dust floating in the air.</p>

  <p>And one by one, more mountains followed the first into collapse.</p>

  <p>It took about five minutes for the entire mountain range to disappear into thin air.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the golden swords on the Feather Emperor Island had all vanished as well.</p>

  <p>To the others, undergoing the Heavenly Tribulation was like experiencing a life and death situation, which was why it was also called the life-and-death tribulation. But it wasn't as difficult for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful this Heavenly Tribulation was, as long as Luo Zheng's connection with the great world wasn't severed, nothing could kill him.</p>

  <p>There did exist the kind of Heavenly Tribulation that possessed the power to destroy the heavens and the earth. When some super masters of the Upper World underwent their tribulation, the power that would erupt would be enough to destroy a great world.</p>

  <p>After surviving the Metal Tribulation, the Wind Tribulation appeared in the sky again. He had to go through five waves of tribulation in all.</p>

  <p>An hour later, when nothing more appeared, Luo Luo Zheng blinked at the clear sky and asked, "Is it finally over?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt relaxed in this moment. While he was undergoing his tribulation, the life vitality in his elixir field gradually solidified. Just as he stood up to leave, thinking that it was over, a phantom of a pure white Lotus Flower suddenly appeared in the sky. The Lotus Flower was still a bud and had yet to bloom.</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"Why did a huge Lotus Flower appear in the sky?"</p>

  <p>"Is this also a part of the Heavenly Tribulation? It doesn't look like something ominous, though."</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm were astonished. They stared blankly at the phantom of the Lotus Flower in the sky.</p>

  <p>They didn't know what it was, but Derek knew.</p>

  <p>When Derek saw the phantom of the Lotus Flower in bud, his expression suddenly changed, and his voice began to tremble. "It has appeared! It has really appeared! I can't believe that this has happened. A Lotus Flower blooming in the Small Heavenly Tribulation! This? This is incredible!"</p>

  <p>Marine blinked as she saw this and fell into deep thought.</p>

  <p>She knew a little about this Lotus Flower, thanks to some of the most secretive documents in the secret sect.</p>

  <p>The classification of talents in the Upper World was different from that in the Lower World. There was no such thing as earth-level talent or heaven-level talent or divine-level talent in the Upper World where a martial artist's potential could only be gauged by the tribulation he or she had undergone. In other words, the appearance of the Lotus Flower during the tribulation would decide a warrior's level.</p>

  <p>It was recorded in the documents that the Lotus Flower was something beyond the concept of heavenly law. If the lotus appeared after a warrior underwent the tribulation, it was an indication that the martial artist had the potential to go beyond the heavenly law.</p>

  <p>Of course, this didn't mean that one would surely be able to go beyond the heavenly law just because the Lotus Flower had appeared. There were many warriors in the one hundred thousand supreme worlds and there were only a few who had achieved that in the past 3.6 billion years.</p>

  <p>"But according to the records, the Lotus Flower would only appear in the Big Heavenly Tribulation. Why did it appear in the Small Heavenly Tribulation that Luo Luo Zheng is undergoing?" Marine looked at Luo Luo Zheng in a daze.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was her enemy, she had become more and more curious about him, now that the Lotus Flower had made an appearance.</p>

  <p>She said, "I wonder how many petals the Lotus Flower will have in Luo Zheng's tribulation? Three or five?"</p>

  <p>Derek shook his head and said, "A martial artist who can make the Lotus Flower produce three petals is qualified to become the core of a ninth grade sacred place. If the Lotus Flower produces five petals, the person could enter a tenth grade sacred place and become the core of a first-rate force. Holy Maiden, please report this matter through the Reverse Spirit Channel."</p>

  <p>Marine nodded. As the Holy Maiden of the secret sect, she was well aware of what was important and what was not. Since Luo Luo Zheng had made the Lotus Flower bloom during his tribulation, the conflict between her and Luo Luo Zheng was no longer important.</p>

  <p>Hearing their conversation, the powerful warriors of the Soul Sea Realm felt chills pass through their veins, causing them to become serious.</p>

  <p>Although these powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm were mighty in the Divine Kingdom Continent and were considered powerful figures in the Lower World, they were nothing compared to the masters of the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Although they were the rulers of the seventh-grade divine kingdoms, they had spent many years but still hadn't been able to completely occupy the Feather Holy Sea, which was only an eighth-grade sacred place of the Dragon Lineage Human. Then what would a ninth grade sacred place be like? What would a tenth grade sacred place be like?</p>

  <p>This was simply unimaginable!</p>

  <p>The pure white Lotus Flower slowly revolved above Luo Zheng's head. After a long while, a pure white petal emerged slowly from the bud.</p>

  <p>The moment the petal came out, a fragrant smell wafted out from it and filled everyone's nostrils.</p>

  <p>"This Lotus Flower is so fragrant!" Fiona couldn't help but sniff the air.</p>

  <p>Although the fragrance was rich, it wasn't unpleasant. Just a deep breath and the fragrance seemed to seep into one's soul.</p>

  <p>"The first one," Marine said as she bit her lip. Though she had known the Lotus Flower from the documents, it was the first time she had seen a martial artist make the Lotus Flower bloom with her own eyes. And now she was actually looking forward to seeing more petals come out of it.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stood still on the ground, quiet as he looked at the Lotus Flower revolving slowly in the sky, his eyes clear as water. Through the cyan dragon's explanation, he already knew what this Lotus Flower represented.</p>

  <p>As the Lotus Flower revolved, another petal came out.</p>

  <p>"The second one," Marine said, keeping up the count.</p>
