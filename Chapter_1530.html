  <p>The sound of doubtful whispers and chatters filled the area.</p>

  <p>It was because Luo Luo Zheng was a cultivator from the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>It would be acceptable if it was any other warrior. After all, warriors who had entered the top five million rankings were already considered as outstanding individuals in the whole universe.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had already set so many frightening records before that.</p>

  <p>Even the sword attack he had left in the Sword Practicing Hall still sat firmly at the top of the list, and shocked almost all the martial artists who entered the Sword Practicing Hall!</p>

  <p>Thus, the people were quite disappointed to know that such a man was still in the three million, nine hundred thousandth place in the rankings.</p>

  <p>It was even better if they didn't see his rank in the list instead.</p>

  <p>There were Illusion Spaces in many places in the universe, and they were also in almost every sacred place. Luo Luo Zheng was famous for tricking and killing Supreme Lords and occasionally telling stories through the Roaring Token, so it was natural for many people to look for his name.</p>

  <p>In addition, many more had also discovered his existence when he entered the top five million rankings.</p>

  <p>"Tsk, Luo Luo Zheng is only so-so. The Illusion Battlefield has been opened for so long, but he is only ranked among top four million..."</p>

  <p>"I told you. This Luo Luo Zheng is just lucky that he got that strange Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>His own strength is not worth mentioning! How can he compete with the talents from the one hundred thousand supreme worlds?"</p>

  <p>"If he's weaker than the others, he shouldn't enter the Illusion Battlefield and embarrass himself!"</p>

  <p>"I heard that Luo Luo Zheng got trapped in the Immortal Mansion because he had killed four Supreme Lords. That is equivalent to a capital offence. Maybe he is also looking for a breakthrough in his cultivation to deal with that problem!"</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>There were countless living beings in the universe, so many of them had still recognized Luo Luo Zheng among the five million ranked names despite many creatures didn't know him well. But soon enough, Luo Zheng's ranking had spread throughout the universe.</p>

  <p>The ones who received the most attention were usually those who ranked in the top 100. However, Luo Luo Zheng was an exception.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Luo Zheng himself floated about outside the main city.</p>

  <p>Many warriors in the main city got intimidated of him after he had killed Layne.</p>

  <p>Everyone there clearly knew how powerful Layne was. The majority of them couldn't even withstand a single attack from him. Yet, this human martial artist named Luo Luo Zheng had killed Layne three times--like he was a monster.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's display of his unfathomable strength, no warrior in the city was willing to surrender the Illusion Points they had painstakingly accumulated themselves.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that there weren't any martial artists who challenged Luo Luo Zheng, but the ones who challenged him were ogre martial artists who didn't care about the Illusion Points. They were weak and it was meaningless to kill them.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng helplessly wandered around the city again.</p>

  <p>Even then, the impact of Luo Luo Zheng and Layne's battle was too great. Wherever Luo Luo Zheng flew around the city walls, all the warriors inside followed him.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't because they wanted to challenge him. Rather, watching a battle between powerhouses was greatly beneficial to them, so they didn't want to miss any opportunities.</p>

  <p>Therefore, a black mass of ogre martial artists would immediately tail Luo Luo Zheng by the city walls everywhere he passed.</p>

  <p>With such overwhelming attention, who would be so stupid as to stay outside the city?</p>

  <p>Some of the warriors who were fighting outside the city noticed the commotion on top of the city walls. When they saw Luo Luo Zheng rush towards them alone, would they dare continue their fights? One by one, the warriors outside retreated back to the main city.</p>

  <p>It was quite silly, even Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but laugh wryly at the scene.</p>

  <p>It was just because the rules in the Illusion Battlefield were like that. It was useless to complain, but Luo Luo Zheng wasn't used to complaining anyway.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had circled the city twice, he found that it was hopeless to gain Illusion Points. In the end, he had given up.</p>

  <p>When he had returned to the main city this time however, he had already acquired 300, 000 Illusion Points!</p>

  <p>He suddenly thought of the cave at that moment--the cave which only allowed those who could pay 300, 000 Illusion points to enter.</p>

  <p>It was meaningless to stay in the main city anyway. Even if he walked a bit more and fought some warriors, he still wouldn't get many Illusion Points. He would be better off exploring the cave first.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Battlefield's rules were illogical, but maybe they had something to do with the wilderness.</p>

  <p>After all, the purpose of the Illusion Battlefield was to decide the strongest living being in the Soul Sea Realm. However, even the mightiest powerhouses wouldn't be able to do anything if everyone stayed in the main city.</p>

  <p>The longer Luo Luo Zheng thought about it, the less he hesitated. He looked around the numerous warriors on the city wall, and then flew out into the wilderness once more.</p>

  <p>Dust rolled down the ground from the feet of the six ogre warriors who stood at a corner of the city walls. All of them were focused on the direction where Luo Luo Zheng had left.</p>

  <p>"This human martial artist left alone. Should we follow him?"</p>

  <p>"If the six of us join forces, we should be able to kill him. There are quite a lot of Illusion Points in his body."</p>

  <p>"This is our chance."</p>

  <p>Those six ogre martial artists were known to have extraordinary backgrounds. While Layne was more powerful than them, their strengths weren't much far from his.</p>

  <p>Then again, none of them dared to say that they were confident about defeating Luo Luo Zheng under such circumstances; but the number of Illusion Points Luo Luo Zheng had was extremely tempting. Thus, they didn't want to let go of Luo Luo Zheng, and the six of them decided to join forces against him.</p>

  <p>They got a little excited when they saw Luo Luo Zheng leave alone. However, it was difficult for them to decide whether to chase after him or not.</p>

  <p>As one of them watched Luo Zheng's figure slowly disappear, he shook his head and finally said, "It's better not to. He hasn't displayed half of his true strength yet!"</p>

  <p>The strength he had shown was already terrifying. Even if he had so many Illusion Points, no one knew what methods and trump cards Luo Luo Zheng had--so the six of them still chose to give up just to be safe.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Luo Zheng deliberately slowed down before he left.</p>

  <p>He knew that some martial artists were greedy. Perhaps they would join forces to hunt him down, and that was what he always waited for.</p>

  <p>This time however, he got a tad disappointed because no one followed him out of the city.</p>

  <p>"It seems that I was still a bit too greedy," he murmured.</p>

  <p>It was indeed a bit too much for him to kill Layne three times in a row.</p>

  <p>But then he thought, the effect wouldn't be too different even if he only killed Layne once. He estimated that he still wouldn't be able to catch many fat sheep.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sped up his pace and rushed towards the wilderness since no one was after him anyway.</p>

  <p>An hour later, Luo Luo Zheng had already traveled more than ten thousand miles and finally found the cave. His feet came to a halt, then he sized up the area. His lips curved into a slight frown; three more Celestial Mice were actually around the cave.</p>

  <p>After a Celestial Mouse was killed, it would 'revive' again after a period of time.</p>

  <p>'The reward for killing a Celestial Mouse isn't small either. One kill is worth a thousand Illusion Points, and I can get another 3, 000 Illusion Points every time I kill them? A strong person can repeatedly kill the Celestial Mice here, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Although it was a relatively safe method to acquire Illusion Points, many Soul Sea Realm warriors still found it tough to kill a Celestial Mouse, so that they would rather kill warriors outside the city.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng thought that their method of accumulating Illusion Points was a bit stupid, yet the speed at which he was accumulating the points wasn't too fast either.</p>

  <p>'I'll enter the cave first. There must be something important inside since the Illusion Battlefield arranged them!'</p>

  <p>With that in mind, Luo Luo Zheng didn't hesitate any longer and he charged towards the three Celestial Mice in a flash.</p>

  <p>Since he had some experience before, dealing with the Celestial Mice now would be much easier.</p>

  <p>He used the Eight Smoky Melodies and the Thunderbolt Annihilation and lured the Celestial Mice into the thunder, then used the Heavenly Tribulation to kill them.</p>

  <p>After the 3, 000 Illusion Points entered his body, he headed straight for the cave.</p>

  <p>Just as he approached the cave, a beam of light blocked his path and a thought spoke in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Entering Evil Wind Cave requires 300, 000 Illusion Points."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head indifferently when he heard those words. "Alright," he said as he stared at the pitch black cave.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>There was a strange pulling force from the cave, which then pulled out the yellow points of light from Luo Zheng's body. After that, all the yellow Illusion Points entered the beam of light.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had lost 300, 000 Illusion Points in a blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Luo Zheng had made this decision, he still felt his heart ache when he saw the numerous Illusion Points he'd worked so hard for quickly got taken away.</p>
