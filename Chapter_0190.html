  <p>
</p>

  <p>Josef took to his heels and Luo Zheng chased closely behind, and they were soon running out of the barrack and onto the streets.</p>

  <p>Josef was quick on his feet, but facing Zheng's hot pursuit, he began to employ every trick that he could think of.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the willow leaf darts didn't work on Luo Zheng, he fished out a piece of brown sign paper and cursed, "Soldier in armor!"</p>

  <p>Josef tossed the paper note in the air. The paper went up in flames at once and a soldier wearing an armor materialized out of thin air. Facing Luo Zheng, he wielded a sword and slashed at the opponent.</p>

  <p>"Smash to pieces!"</p>

  <p>Smack! Luo Zheng threw a punch and the soldier vanished as instantly as it had appeared. Without pause, Luo Zheng opened his fist and shook it casually, before moving to gain ground on Josef.</p>

  <p>Feeling cornered, Josef gnashed his teeth together in frustration. The very next instant he crushed the pendant that hung around his neck with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>The pendant was an heirloom passed down by the Zhuge ancestors. It had been bestowed on him when he became the counselor to the imperial army, with claims that the pendant would come to his rescue in times of danger.</p>

  <p>As soon as he crushed it, a pale blue nimbus of light surrounded him protectively, making him glow with an otherworldly Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>"Smash it!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng punched the light with his fist.</p>

  <p>The luminous curtain trembled faintly but soon recovered its intensity.</p>

  <p>"So strong?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned, his eyes glinting at the blue Mu Ning. The light curtain was indeed remarkable to resist the power of his fist. He assumed it was an heirloom from the Zhuge family. It obviously held ancestral power.</p>

  <p>Pow! Smack! Smash!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng struck the cloak of light a dozen times in a row. It quivered palpably but he failed to make the slightest crack on its surface.</p>

  <p>Josef exhaled as he watched the sight. If he could just hold on for a while, the reinforcements would come to his aid. This was White Emperor City, and he was the counselor to the imperial army, after all.</p>

  <p>How could Josef let this jerk show such impudence and run unrestrained on his own turf? Josef curled his lip. "Don't waste your time trying to break it open. It's the invaluable Nine-foot Spectroscope. Once it is released from the pendant, even the Illuminating Soul Realm is unable to crack it in such a short time."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't give up and kept at it, but found that he really couldn't smash the curtain with mere brute force. Firmly, as if deciding on something, he nodded his head and a stream of demonic life energy rose from his palms. He swerved it in the direction of the curtain. In a flash, the sizzling life energy hit the curtain and infused in it.</p>

  <p>It worked like a charm. The demonic life energy held the power of annihilation and devoured anything that came its way. It forced a crack into the curtain and spread to the other parts in a heartbeat.</p>

  <p>"What did you do? How is this possible? What was that thing you used?"</p>

  <p>A vein pulsed in Josef's temple as he took in the scene, angered beyond belief. "Luo Zheng, this is White Emperor City. If you dare hurt me, you risk antagonizing the imperial army, with its millions of soldiers. Are you sure you want to do that?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng scoffed at his words. Before the light curtain could be completely devoured by the demonic life energy, he squeezed one of his hands through the crack and caught Josef by his neck. "Oh? I risk antagonizing the imperial army with its millions of soldiers, do I? You are only a counselor to the imperial army. You think you represent each of those soldiers?"</p>

  <p>"It's true that I don't represent the entire imperial army, but don't forget that my last name is Zhuge. If you provoke the Zhuge Clan, you become our enemy. We will hunt you down to the ends of the earth and make sure you die a painful death!" Josef announced, his eyes blazing a warning.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng exhaled sharply and tightened his grip on Josef's neck. "Hmm.</p>

  <p>Seems to me you Zhuge people are all the same. Using the name of your family to threaten and intimidate others. Except for that, what else can you do?"</p>

  <p>Josef's hand shot up to seize Zheng's own that held his neck. A sinister smile found its way to his lips. "There are many things we can do. One of them is killing you!"</p>

  <p>Even before he finished speaking, a blue paper shaped into a symbol appeared on his palm. He placed it on Zheng's hand forcefully and it burned into flames. What followed were tiny sparks of lightning that rushed to surround Zheng's body. They didn't harm him, instead, he felt that every muscle of his body had suddenly gone numb. In other words, he was paralyzed.</p>

  <p>Sizzling sounds engulfed the air, and Luo Zheng stood deathly still, unable to move an inch.</p>

  <p>Josef roared with laughter. "You smug asshole. You didn't think I had this trick up my sleeve, did you? Hah! Now die!"</p>

  <p>A brilliant sharp dagger popped out of thin air in Josef's hand, and he moved forward to stab Luo Zheng in his neck.</p>

  <p>Josef knew his strength was not extreme, so he had many hidden weapons on him. Those little things could come handy in times of peril.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, as the dagger reached Zheng's body halfway, Josef felt a sharp pain shoot into his brain. Holding his head in his hands, he dropped unceremoniously on the ground and rolled over.</p>

  <p>"Spiritual Thorn!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at Josef coldly who was lying on the ground, groaning in pain. The murderous look in his eyes held no mercy.</p>

  <p>As the lightning effect released by the blue symbol ebbed away, Luo Zheng moved his unfeeling body and picked up the dagger that Josef had let fall on the ground. He marched over to Josef in a split second.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are! If you dare kill the counselor to the imperial army, you become the enemy of the Burning Sky Empire!" At that moment, Luo Zheng noticed a black figure approaching him in the shadows. He heard a brief growl as his dagger moved toward Josef.</p>

  <p>"Is it another representative of the empire?" His brows snapped together as he stabbed Josef sharply. "Death calls you!"</p>
