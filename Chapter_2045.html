  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the eyes of Luo Luo Zheng, the ability possessed by Maha to freely change the Laws in this area was too powerful.</p>

  <p>If he used it properly, Luo Luo Zheng would be unable to predict what the outcome might be.</p>

  <p>Since Maha had slashed his saber towards him, even though he might be injured, Luo Luo Zheng was naturally unwilling to let the opportunity pass. He managed to grab the saber in his hand!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body was already strong enough to astonish everyone who saw it.</p>

  <p>Even without using the power transfer skill, it was impossible to harm him by ordinary means.</p>

  <p>As he caught the saber in his hand, Luo Luo Zheng pulled it quickly towards him.</p>

  <p>The vast strength within his body gushed out, and Maha who was caught off-guard didn't have time to react. He even forgot to release the saber from his hand, and was therefore pulled like a lamb in Luo Zheng's direction!</p>

  <p>When he witnessed the terrifying strength within Luo Zheng's body, Maha knew immediately that it would not be possible for him to defeat Luo Luo Zheng in close combat.</p>

  <p>As he was pulled towards Luo Luo Zheng, his body began to slide like a mudfish, desperate to break free of Luo Zheng's grip.</p>

  <p>Maha used a very special movement technique. As his life vitality had gushed from his body, it had created a thin film that totally enveloped his body, making it impossible for others to capture him.</p>

  <p>He had already evaded Luo Zheng's attacks several times before, and expected to do the same on this occasion.</p>

  <p>However, the instant he made a move to escape, a ribbon of colorful light shot from Luo Zheng's hand and bound Maha's body to him.</p>

  <p>The Death Chain.</p>

  <p>Having seized his opportunity, Luo Luo Zheng hesitated no longer as he linked himself with Maha.</p>

  <p>There was a reason Luo Luo Zheng had hesitated to use the Death Chain. He was aware that although he could only see Maha, the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race would certainly be hiding in the shadows. If the Supreme Lords chose to attack while he was bound to Maha, then there was no chance he would be able to escape.</p>

  <p>However, he finally decided that he must take risks to kill Maha.</p>

  <p>When Maha was bound by the Death Chain, he soon realized the nature of Luo Zheng's plan. If other warriors constantly encountered setbacks like Maha had, by now they would have panicked and lost their wits. They would no longer have possessed the will to fight.</p>

  <p>However, Maha still retained his absolutely calm demeanor and did not demonstrate the slightest panic.</p>

  <p>It only took a thought and Maha restored the Wind Law which he had banned earlier. His body spun and jumped into the air as he attempted to free himself from the Death Chain, but even if he erupted with all his strength, the Death Chain only wrapped him tighter and showed no signs of breaking.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he felt an irresistible force pulling him back.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Luo Zheng who was pulling the Death Chain back to him.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng pulled Maha back, he punched out at the same moment. But, when Maha was just a few feet away from him, his figure strangely vanished.</p>

  <p>Maha was once again modifying the Space Law, and he quickly reappeared behind Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The space in front of Luo Luo Zheng and the space behind him were connected by the power of Space Law, and the Death Chain appeared to be divided into two parts.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stepped forward. He wanted to dash into the space which was before him, but once he entered it, he found himself in the Iron Moon City.</p>

  <p>"What?" he exclaimed, his astonishment obvious. Confusion and helplessness could be read in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>By now, Maha had already modified the Space Law so much within the radius of the Grand World Technique that it was a complete mess.</p>

  <p>Countless invisible voids connected with each other, forming an invisible labyrinth. Although Maha was unable to break free from the Death Chain, Luo Luo Zheng was equally stuck, being unable to get close to him.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Maha would appear right behind Luo Luo Zheng, but then only a split-second later, he would reappear somewhere else ten thousand feet away in the sky. As for Luo Luo Zheng, even if he only moved half a step, he would slip into a void and instantly reappear in an unknown location.</p>

  <p>As a result, their fight developed into a stalemate.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had traveled through space ten times, he reappeared and found that he was only ten feet away from his opponent.</p>

  <p>But in truth, the space between them wasn't as simple to cover as it looked. If Luo Luo Zheng were to take a step forward, he knew that he would step into the void in front of him and once again reappear somewhere at a great distance from Maha.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng felt helpless. He stared at the satisfied smile on Maha's face and asked in a cold voice, "Is there anything else you can do apart dodging?"</p>

  <p>Maha's grin grew broader as he replied, "There are many ways to kill an opponent. I admit that you are a very powerful enemy. Your body is unbelievably strong and you have already surpassed the limits of a secondary creature. You are an extraordinary talent even in the divine land. Your physical strength is also quite astonishing..."</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Maha had made such remarks to an enemy.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, Luo Zheng's great talent had truly astonished him.</p>

  <p>But he suddenly changed the topic and said, "There are many ways that warriors can choose to fight, but their final goal is always the same, and that is to kill the opponent. You only need to know that in the end I will win this battle!"</p>

  <p>"What is the basis upon which you draw such a conclusion?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>While Maha's strength was indeed extraordinary it was still inferior to Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>With his current strength, Maha might be able to fight some low-rank Supreme Lords, but it was not easy for him to defeat them.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, even if he did not use the Enemy Repelling Arts, he was still able to kill a warrior at Supreme Lord Shadow's level. If he used the Enemy Repelling Arts, he could fight a mid-rank Supreme Lord or even a top-rank Supreme Lord!</p>

  <p>However, the way the Supreme Lords used their Heavenly Destinies could be very flexible. Even a top-rank Supreme Lord could not have absolute confidence in their ability to kill a low-rank Supreme Lord. The battles between warriors were always changing.</p>

  <p>Maha turned Luo Luo Zheng with a smile and replied, "You've already been trapped by my skill. You will not be able to escape."</p>

  <p>Since his Grand World Technique could change the Laws at his will, he was able to take advantage of it in a wide variety of ways. Now that Maha had totally modified the Space Law here, he was unable to leave by himself, as was Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This was because the Grand Teleportation technique was forbidden in this area, and even Luo Zheng's Teleportation Token was rendered nullified.</p>

  <p>After all, the Space Law in the Evolutionary Universe was not applicable to this particular spot any longer.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, Luo Luo Zheng was completely trapped here.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly amazing to possess such a powerful body," continued Maha. "But in the end, it will change nothing. You will still have to die here."</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, Maha suddenly sat down with his legs crossed.</p>

  <p>His eyes began to take on a glassy appearance as he recited, "Eternity, happiness, self..." At the same time, a very special Mu Ning began to emanate from his body. That Mu Ning was gentle and steady, and it looked as though he was attempting to summon something.</p>

  <p>Regrettably, before he was able to finish the chanting, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly pulled the Death Chain to his side. Because of his great strength, Maha gave a stuffy cough as he was dragged by the chain and made to randomly fly around in the chaotic space. He suddenly closed in and then reappeared behind Luo Luo Zheng. He then reappeared at a distant corner. But still, Luo Luo Zheng could not pull Maha to his side.</p>

  <p>Maha had planned to use a special skill. He was now furious that he had been abruptly interrupted by Luo Luo Zheng. He glared at Luo Luo Zheng before sitting cross-legged in the air again. "Eternity, happiness, self, clearness, reflection, killing, clarity..."</p>

  <p>Noting that he had begun chanting again, Luo Luo Zheng pulled the Death Chain once more.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Maha started to rapidly appear and then disappear in many different positions as if he was in a Whack-A-Mole game. His chanting had been once more interrupted by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He glared angrily at Luo Luo Zheng, but Luo Luo Zheng maintained a poker face.</p>

  <p>As the Supreme Lords of both sides beheld this scene, they were all dumbfounded. While some of them even burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>This fight between the two Godly Geniuses had gradually turned into a farce because they were unable to do anything to each other.</p>

  <p>"Maha plans to use the Heavens-suppressing Object to defeat Luo Luo Zheng," a Supreme Lord from Sacred race said. He had already identified Maha's intentions.</p>

  <p>Another Supreme Lord frowned and said, "The Grand Supreme Lord did indeed bestow this ability upon Maha before we came to this universe, but Maha could only use it once. It is very precious. Wouldn't it be too much of a waste to use it to kill Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Maha had prepared well before he led the Sacred race in their invasion of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>However, the Heavens-suppressing Object had originally been intended to deal with the True God in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>But now Maha had no alternative. He simply couldn't defeat Luo Luo Zheng in any other way.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be a waste to kill Luo Luo Zheng," Supreme Lord Denzel said simply.</p>

  <p>His words were immediately received with approval by other Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are right!"</p>

  <p>"It is almost impossible for such a great talent to appear in the Evolutionary Universe. He must be the last hope of Luo Xiao. No wonder Holy Murphy had specifically ordered us to first kill the Godly Geniuses in this universe!"</p>

  <p>The Sacred race had taken a great deal of effort to train Maha to this level. Even so, Maha couldn't have been as good as he was without the help of Murphy.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was far stronger than Maha in every respect. They speculated that training Luo Luo Zheng must have taken much more effort. There was no reason for them to let Luo Luo Zheng live!</p>
