<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After she heard his words, the gorgeous woman retorted with a smile. "You always boast about being the best in terms of talent. Back then, it only took me a year and a half to comprehend it!"</p>

  <p>The handsome man seemed unbothered by her claims. Even though time didn't hold any value in this space, he didn't want to seem inferior to the pretty woman. "It's only because your compatibility level is higher than that of mine. If we are on par with each other in terms of compatibility level, you would never be as good as me..."</p>

  <p>While the two were engrossed in a heated conversation, King Manard raised his hand and said, "I'll take my leave now. I have to cultivate in seclusion during this period. Inform me after he finishes comprehending the Truth of Three-Energy Construction."</p>

  <p>"But Master, when will you take us to the Abstruse Energy World?" the handsome man suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Since the handsome man and the pretty woman were tossed into this space, they were unable to join the other disciples. Naturally, they felt frustrated since they were the only ones left out.</p>

  <p>However, King Manard casually posed the question to him. "Have you deciphered the Sanskrit words I gave you?"</p>

  <p>Both of their faces reflected a hint of disappointment as they turned their gaze away without a response.</p>

  <p>The Abstruse Energy World had certain rules, and the rules were related to the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>Every light spot contained innumerable groups of words, and the form of expression was similar to the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>The Instant Civilization originated from the Abstruse Energy World. Since they were well acquainted with it, the Sanskrit words created by them were the replica of the words of the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>King Manard was highly skilled in deciphering the Sanskrit words, and his other twelve disciples could be said to be on the same level as him. They had studied the rules of the Abstruse Energy World through deciphering the Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>If the handsome man and the pretty woman desired to enter the Abstruse Energy World, they had to have a sound understanding of the Sanskrit words, at least to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>However, in the present, they still had a ways to go before they could be able to do that.</p>

  <p>After the question, King Manard turned around and entered the inner hall alone.</p>

  <p>King Manard's words of wisdom to Luo Zheng stated that everything could be dealt with easily. However, his words had contradicted with his reality. He, too, had to encounter many difficulties in his path before he could reach his goal.</p>

  <p>Back then, in the Abstruse Energy World, he had stumbled upon something that had the form of a mountain with his disciples. It was obvious the mountain was gathered by innumerable spots of light.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Power was obtained from the mountain.</p>

  <p>Had it been a normal world, they would have easily split the entire mountain open to see what was inside.</p>

  <p>However, the rules of the Abstruse Energy World were differed from that of the other worlds, and even the cognitions were different. Eventually, King Manard and his disciples were forced to lower their curiosities. They could only wander on the surface of it and were denied entry to the inside. Alas, they only obtained a small amount of Other Shore Power from a corner of the mountain...</p>

  <p>Breaking through the mountain was a more difficult task than he had imagined it to be. This time, King Manard cultivated in seclusion to have a more clear understanding of the rules attached to the mountain.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the handsome man and the pretty woman both walked out of the palace while sulking under their breaths.</p>

  <p>"The Sanskrit words that Master passed down to us are too hard to decipher.</p>

  <p>He hasn't even given us any hint on how to do it. It's simply impossible for us to decipher them on our own," the handsome man complained, his arms crossed tightly near his chest.</p>

  <p>"He said it only took three years for his first disciple to decipher those Sanskrit words. I couldn't believe it!" the pretty woman exclaimed with her fists clenched.</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words were placed somewhere in the palace. Before Luo Zheng's arrival, the handsome man and the pretty woman were occupied with managing the creatures of this space and comprehending the Sanskrit words. When their gaze fell upon Luo Zheng, they immediately left everything to focus on him instead, since they had fallen victim to their boredom due to the tedious routine.</p>

  <p>Instead of biding their time and deciphering the Sanskrit words, they turned all their attention towards Luo Zheng while he cultivated the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Upon returning to the center of the palace, they overheard Luo Zheng reciting inside the wall.</p>

  <p>"Getting punished for creating things; heaven and earth should be destroyed?"</p>

  <p>The handsome man blinked slightly as if mesmerized, and his face turned a serious color. "He seems to have recited more than eight hundred words."</p>

  <p>"What? That's impossible! You must have heard it wrong." As if shocked, the pretty woman paced to his side and pricked up her ears to eavesdrop.</p>

  <p>While she listened intently, her expression quickly switched.</p>

  <p>They had left for only a short while, and Luo Zheng had already progressed to almost one thousand words.</p>

  <p>Even though the handsome man excelled in talents, his compatibility level was low. He recalled when he read the Truth of Godly Way for the first time, he had only managed to recite a thousand words. Knowing Luo Zheng read out one thousand in one go without any difficulty made him shocked to his core.</p>

  <p>They remained rooted to their positions and kept listening from the other side. Luo Zheng recited in a low voice, almost like a whisper.</p>

  <p>Thirty seconds had passed, and Luo Zheng had already broken through to a thousand words.</p>

  <p>"It seems the boy's comprehension far surpasses yours." The pretty woman giggled as she nudged him teasingly. "I think he can cultivate the Truth of Three-energy Construction within two years."</p>

  <p>The handsome man scoffed and rolled his eyes after he heard her claims.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense. I don't think so!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continued to recite, he had reached two thousand words.</p>

  <p>Soon as she kept listening to Luo Zheng, the pretty woman's radiant face lost its usual color. She always had the satisfaction of being superior to the handsome man in terms of cultivating the Truth of Godly Way. However, it now seemed that Luo Zheng was likely to beat her record of reciting two thousand words in her first try!</p>

  <p>Five minutes after, Luo Zheng had recited two thousand words without pause.</p>

  <p>But he didn't stop there, and he reached three thousand words, four thousand words, and then five thousand words...</p>

  <p>It was Luo Zheng's first attempt to cultivate the Truth of Three-energy Construction. He didn't stop until he reached eight thousand words in one go.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who sat inside the wall, heaved a long sigh of relief as he regained his breath.</p>

  <p>His compatibility level of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was perfect, and he had comprehended the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent through Instant Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed his compatibility level of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was also high. After all, he had managed to recite eight thousand words in one breath. It was much less complex than cultivating the Truth of Goodwill and Malice and the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was not satisfied with this progress. He didn't feel complacent.</p>

  <p>After all, the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was a complete Truth of Godly Way. The first ten thousand words would pose as no challenge for him, but the last part that was similar to the Truth Enlightenment would be much severe in the level of difficulty it inculcated.</p>

  <p>Even for someone like Luo Zheng, comprehending the Truth Enlightenment of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was a task that required a lot of effort.</p>

  <p>However, the fruits it bore were worth it. The power of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was boundless.</p>

  <p>The soul level of the three kinds of energy in it was exceedingly high.</p>

  <p>When those little monsters and double-headed snakes used it, their power had increased to a frightening level. If those three energies were to be combined, their strength would go beyond comprehension...</p>

  <p>According to King Manard's words, the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was a product of his creation. However, Luo Zheng harbored doubts in his heart against that statement. He strongly felt that the Truth of Godly Way must have been obtained in the Abstruse Energy World. It was apparent his thoughts contradicted with the fact that King Manard had created it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued, oblivious to the fact that the pretty woman and the handsome man had their anticipating eyes glued to the wall. They wore expressions of bewilderment.</p>

  <p>He had recited eight thousand words on his first day, which was equivalent to sixty percent of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. Did this guy really come from the chaos?</p>

  <p>According to what King Manard had told them, anyone who existed in the chaos lacked strength. They were practically worthless.</p>

  <p>Of course, King Manard knew full well not to underestimate the talents that resided in the chaos. Even though he handpicked the most outstanding talents from his inner world to be his disciples, the chaos was much bigger than his inner world and contained more talents. But to practice high morale and confidence in his disciples, he had to belittle the creatures in the chaos to make them feel superior.</p>

  <p>However, the appearance of Luo Zheng and the small spectacle of his talents had exposed King Manard's white lie out in the open. Naturally, the handsome man and the pretty woman hung their heads in crippling depression as they had believed the lie to be true the entire time.</p>

  <p>If King Manard was not their master, they would have apprehended and interrogated him by now.</p>

  <p>The very next day, Luo Zheng had managed to comprehend over nine thousand and nine hundred words of the Truth of Three-energy Construction.</p>

  <p>On the third day, he broke through to ten thousand words.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng had concluded, after he reached ten thousand words, the difficulty of comprehension increased significantly.</p>
