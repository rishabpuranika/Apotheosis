<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3628 The Nine Positions </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was a large gap in strength between the demon women in the Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had fought several of them in the Mountain Viewing Province. Sure, they hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but Luo Zheng also had a natural advantage against the divine flames of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>But there were more powerful demon women in the Divine Lair, some as powerful as Phoenix.</p>

  <p>"All we need to do is guard the Mountain Sea Pass and activate the array!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair roared and nine circles appeared in front of the Mountain Sea Pass, distributed on the outside of the Sky Net. If the Jin Wu showed up, the nine important positions of the array would be the first line of defense.</p>

  <p>"I'll man the first position in the center, and you guard the other eight in pairs," ordered Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Why are the nine positions set outside the Sky Net? Isn't that too dangerous?" Guzman asked, staring at them.</p>

  <p>"The setting of the nine positions has been carefully calculated. Together they form a circular array. They are not flawed; the real flaw is inside the Mountain Sea Pass. We just need to take down as many Jin Wu as we can in our positions," said Sinclair with a faint smile of pride.</p>

  <p>As long as the Jin Wu didn't break the Sky Net, they couldn't hurt the people in the nine positions. In this way, those in the positions were invincible.</p>

  <p>"I see. This array is amazing!" Guzman exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"But if they discover that they can't hurt us, they'll begin attacking the Sky Net. Once the Sky Net is broken, then we'll be in danger. So I hope you will give it your all, not only for the Taiyi Heaven Palace, but for all of us!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair said.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>Just then, a wave of space fluctuation appeared in the nine circles. Nine space channels that distorted the surrounding light extended before Luo Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Sinclair stepped into one of the space channels and appeared in the first position.</p>

  <p>Guzman and another Oneness General then followed suit, appearing in another position.</p>

  <p>The other Oneness Generals, in pairs, did the same, leaving only Luo Zheng and Basil.</p>

  <p>"General Luo Zheng, please," Basil said with a smile, gesturing for Luo Zheng to go first.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded courteously and stepped into the space channel.</p>

  <p>It was only over a thousand feet long. Passing through it was like carrying out a short spatial transference. In an instant, Luo Zheng appeared in one of the positions.</p>

  <p>It was a circle filled with dim lights. To his surprise, they were like a layer of oil spreading in the space, rippling in waves around him.</p>

  <p>When he took a step towards the edge of the circle, it followed him.</p>

  <p>"This circle moves with me?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>He took a step back, and so did the circle. He took a step left, and once again, so did the circle.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was testing this out, Basil appeared as well. Seeing Luo Zheng pacing back and forth made him smile. "It's your first time doing this. You should spend some time getting used to it."</p>

  <p>"The position moves with me, but there are two of us," Luo Zheng said, puzzling a little.</p>

  <p>"We need to act together, or we'll both be standing at the edge while the position remains still," Basil revealed as he walked in the opposite direction to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They stood at both ends of the position so it would not move.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and Basil continued his explanation, "In addition, the position can help us conjure weapons."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and released some Jun of force.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A transparent long sword floated out of their position.</p>

  <p>Basil wielded the sword and slashed out into the space.</p>

  <p>A ray of sword light was created and shot into the distance.</p>

  <p>"Is it Power Shaping?" Luo Zheng asked, curious.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever cultivated the Might Divine Dao?" Basil was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"You could tell from just a glance? All you need to do is release some Jun of force," he said.</p>

  <p>Most in the Source World focused on one Divine Dao, rarely studying the others. But so long as they could reach the Other Shore, everything would be fine.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and stuck his hand out. He released some Jun of force and a long sword floated out of their position, under his control.</p>

  <p>"Could I conjure as many swords as I want with the Power Shaping?" Luo Zheng asked, seeming to have a plan brewing.</p>

  <p>Basil nodded and said, "Of course. It's up to you. But the more swords you conjure, the more difficult it is to control them. If you get distracted, it can become too much to handle. I think you'd better..."</p>

  <p>Before he finished speaking, another transparent sword appeared.</p>

  <p>With both of Luo Zheng's hands clasped, more and more swords began appearing.</p>

  <p>The space around was dense with long swords, each having ten Jun of force.</p>

  <p>With a total of one hundred and twenty-eight swords, that came to more than one thousand Jun of force.</p>

  <p>This was not a large amount to a Oneness General.</p>

  <p>But the long swords danced around their position in unison.</p>

  <p>This stunned Basil and the other Oneness Generals. Basil smiled and said,</p>

  <p>"General Luo Zheng, you are an accomplished warrior of the Might Divine Dao. I admire you greatly."</p>

  <p>He admired Luo Zheng on the surface, but beneath that, he and the other Oneness Generals harbored great disdain in their hearts.</p>

  <p>"Hey, are all the disciples in the Land of Sword Grief practicing these useless methods now?" a Oneness General asked with a condescending smile.</p>

  <p>Guzman stood aside and said nothing, but sneered within himself.</p>

  <p>'Useless?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng has become the number one disciple on the second floor in just two months with his true strength. How could the Oneness General call his method useless?' he thought.</p>

  <p>Seventeen people in the nine positions of the array were ready as the Jin Wu got closer and closer.</p>

  <p>"Quack, quack, quack..."</p>

  <p>Countless Jin Wu cawed queerly. The sounds felt like sandpaper grating against their ears, leaving them in pain.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The first group of Jin Wu approached, turning into sharp black swords releasing golden light, shooting straight for the nine positions of the array.</p>

  <p>"They're Sharp-winged Jin Wu," Luo Zheng said, raising his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Kill them and don't let them get any closer!" Sinclair bellowed.</p>

  <p>The seventeen people in the array stretched out their hands and transparent swords flew upward one by one.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Under the control of the crowd, the swords moved all over the place with ease. Some slashed out sword radiance, some quickly strangled the Sharp-winged Jin Wu and some stabbed out thousands of lines to kill them.</p>
