<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>More than half of the strength source of the nine stars in Luo Zheng's body had been restored. With his recent rejuvenation, it would be a lot easier for him to conquer the next section of the True Path.</p>

  <p>The challenge in that section of True Path was more difficult than the one before. Additionally, there were some restrictions when Bromley set up this path.</p>

  <p>Based on Bromley's plan on the arrangement of the True Path, the Sacred martial artists that appeared at every section of the True Path would be a realm higher than the former section.</p>

  <p>However, the strength of a martial artist could not be determined with only one's realm as the basis.</p>

  <p>The two 'cultivators from remote ages' that Luo Luo Zheng had fought before would be great examples. Although they were only world lords, their true strength was even higher than that of ordinary Supreme Lords. Their power was more condensed and mighty for their level.</p>

  <p>However, the ancient cultivators did not have any intelligence and were unable to utilize their strength fully. That was why they were so easily killed by Luo Luo Zheng. Otherwise, in theory, Luo Luo Zheng would not have been able to defeat them. With Luo Zheng's current comprehension of various Laws and Divine Dao, he was comparably inferior to them.</p>

  <p>It took Luo Luo Zheng less than an hour to pass that particular section of the True Path. His strength had been recovered, and he was able to travel much more quickly.</p>

  <p>A lot of Sacred world lords had emerged from this True Path. It was also the first time Luo Luo Zheng had met the ancient Supreme Lords of the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>When he encountered the ancient Supreme Lords of the Sacred race, he was puzzled. He studied them with confused eyes.</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord was actually a world lord who had carried a Heavenly Destiny. However, Heavenly Destinies didn't exist in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Where could they be able to find one to carry in the divine land then?</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, Luo Luo Zheng immediately got the answer from Saul. In fact, the title of Supreme Lord originated from the Sacred race. Back then, the Sacred race was in the top position in the divine land. Additionally, the power comprehended from the Divine Dao Tablets was known as the Heavenly Destiny. At that time, whenever the Sacred race comprehended a Divine Dao Tablet, they would seal it immediately in efforts to make themselves the only ones to comprehend it. As such, they would be able to maintain their dominance over the divine land.</p>

  <p>Therefore, once an ancient cultivator comprehended the power within a Divine Dao Tablet, they would be called as a Supreme Lord. Impressive abilities would be gained by the cultivator even if their realm remained the same.</p>

  <p>However, as the Sacred race disappeared for no reason, the seals on the Divine Dao Tablets also became ineffective. After that, more and more martial artists comprehended the Divine Dao. Moreover, the number of creatures that managed to become True Gods also increased. The concepts of Supreme Lord and Heavenly Destiny also gradually disappeared. As time passed by, their existences in history and textbooks were forgotten.</p>

  <p>Decades afterward, warriors were able to become Holy Beings and constructed their universes. As such, they were able to turn everything they had comprehended throughout their lives into Heavenly Destinies and pass them down. Thus, Supreme Lords once again appeared within the inner worlds of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The final challenge of this section was an ancient Supreme Lord from the ancient Sacred race. The ancient Supreme Lord cultivated the "Destruction Divine Dao." Although he had completely stepped into the Divine Dao, he hadn't condensed a Godly Tile. As such, he could not be considered a True God.</p>

  <p>The Destruction Divine Dao contained an extremely destructive power.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had the Redemption Armor to protect him. Furthermore, he had just taken the Nine-head Snake Blood Pill. As he was not at a disadvantage in the confrontation, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't afraid of the ancient Supreme Lord. A brave expression was seen on Luo Zheng's face as he confronted the ancient Supreme Lord's destructive power.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the strength source of Luo Zheng's nine stars had mostly been restored. Once he found an opportunity, he would make a move and shatter the ancient Supreme Lord of the Sacred race into Dark and Light energies.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng passed that section of the True Path, he was not that anxious as before. Calmness and tranquility were apparent in his face, There were still two tokens in the True Path, one heaven token, and one earth token.</p>

  <p>The earth token was the key to open the training tower. However, it was not very useful to Luo Luo Zheng at the current stage. After all, distant water cannot quench present thirst. Luo Luo Zheng doubted the possibility that he would be able to go out into the Evolutionary Universe and kill his enemies after he cultivated for some time in the training tower. Luo Luo Zheng continued to be silent as he pondered for his options.</p>

  <p>After some time, Luo Luo Zheng concluded that he could only resign himself to fate.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a golden light descended from the sky. With a wave of a hand, Luo Luo Zheng caught the golden light in his palm. When he turned his hand over, Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed. A beam of joy immediately glistened in his eyes as a smile found its way onto his face.</p>

  <p>In the center of the token, there was a significant character - "heaven." It was the token Luo Luo Zheng had tried so hard to receive.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations! You finally got the token you wanted!" Saul also cheered for him with a cheerful tone and a wide smile.</p>

  <p>In fact, a moment ago, Saul was worried that Luo Luo Zheng might receive the earth token instead?</p>

  <p>If he collected all the eight tokens, Luo Luo Zheng would be able to control the Immortal Mansion completely. He could even remove the enchanted barrier that protected the Immortal Mansion and step into the vast forest. Everything in the Immortal Mansion and the forest around it could easily be explored by him.</p>

  <p>However, the last section of the True Path would definitely not be easy to pass. Even the creatures that guarded the final part of the True Path possessed the strength comparable to that of a True God. With Luo Zheng's current abilities, it would not be easy for him to escape from the hands of a True God, and it would even be more difficult to kill one. Despite that he just regained his strength, it would still be difficult for him to win such a battle.</p>

  <p>With the heaven token in his hand, Luo Luo Zheng returned to the pavilion along the same path. Afterward, he walked along the side of the pavilion to enter the backyard of the Immortal Mansion. His determination was apparent in his every step.</p>

  <p>Compared to the magnificence of the front yard of the Immortal Mansion, the backyard was much more neglected. Dry leaves and clutter were scattered in the area. The only thing that blocked Luo Zheng's way was a row of broken fences?</p>

  <p>However, there were streams of faint golden light that floated above the fence. Within those golden rays, some small golden people held long swords. Luo Luo Zheng could feel a faint Mu Ning from the golden figures.</p>

  <p>Although the Mu Ning was not strong, Luo Luo Zheng felt something eerie with a single glance. Additionally, he believed that the power within the divine textures was not to be trifled with. If he were to trigger the divine textures, he would instantly be killed. Cold sweat trickled down his spine as he continued to stare at the figures.</p>

  <p>However, the restrictive divine textures weren't aimed at Luo Luo Zheng. All of the tiny golden figures were faced towards the backyard. It was apparent that they were meant to guard against something from the backyard.</p>

  <p>After he thought of what his father had told him, Luo Luo Zheng felt a chill down his spine. His face grew even more serious as he strengthened his guard.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Luo Zheng had already prepared himself before he took the challenge of the True Path. Mike had told him that there were some extremely vicious people locked up in the dungeon in the backyard of Bromley's Immortal Mansion. He was ready for harsh challenges and difficult battles that he might encounter.</p>

  <p>Although the warriors in the backyard were not as strong as Holy Beings, they were still top-level True Gods.</p>

  <p>The situation in the Evolutionary Universe had already progressed to its final step. Since they couldn't defeat the Sacred race, Luo Luo Zheng wanted to seek the help of these prisoners.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng were to do this, it would mean that Mike would undoubtedly die.</p>

  <p>That was because once those prisoners got involved, it would be a violation of the rules of the Hall of Holy Beings. If it were to happen, it would be easy for Murphy to shatter Evolutionary Universe since he had a justified reason.</p>

  <p>At that time, Mike was not aware that the rules of the Hall of Holy Beings had been changed. Nevertheless, Luo Luo Zheng was aware of the changes now and had no qualms about the completion of his plans.</p>

  <p>However, the people locked up in the dungeon weren't easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>Saul could be an example as it seemed that it was horrible for him to stay in the Immortal Mansion. Fortunately, Saul was still able to move freely in the Immortal Mansion and even manage the affairs of the Immortal Mansion. It was hard to consider him as a prisoner.</p>

  <p>The warriors in the dungeon had actually been trapped there for countless years. Slowly, their minds and characters had deteriorated and were corrupted over the years. Who knew what their state of mind had become after so many years' imprisonment? Perhaps they had all become lunatics. Luo Luo Zheng feared that as soon as he opened the door of the dungeon, they would tear him into pieces.</p>

  <p>Everything had certain risks, and that time, Luo Luo Zheng was the one who had to take the risk.</p>

  <p>As he stood in front of the door of the backyard, Luo Luo Zheng became hesitant.</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment before he activated the heaven token in his hand.</p>

  <p>Creak!</p>

  <p>A section of the fence in front of the back courtyard swung open. An entrance appeared for Luo Luo Zheng. However, it also meant that an exit just became available for the prisoners.</p>

  <p>The instant the fence was opened, a thunderous roar rang out. At the same time, a fearsome Mu Ning came from the back courtyard?</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning was extremely vicious, but the creature that released it was still unidentified.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng recognized the Mu Ning. A long time ago, he encountered it in the Immortal Mansion. At that time, Saul had told him that it was from a dog kept in the Immortal Mansion.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng stepped into the backyard, he followed the source of the Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, he saw that there was indeed a dog house on the side. A ferocious beast with a formidable appearance was lying on the ground.</p>

  <p>The green eyes of the beast stared coldly at him.</p>
