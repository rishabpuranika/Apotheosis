<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>She had fiddled with Zheng's disciple card and because of that, Mu Ning had even monitored Luo Zheng all his way when he went to the Hell Mountain alone last time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wore a disciple card all the time, and Mu Ning was able to track wherever he was with her Picture Slab as long as he entered the territory of Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Aura's Picture Slab documented everything that occurred the other day. After watching the records of the Picture Slab, Mu Ning discovered that Luo Zheng was threatened by Saint Viana. This discovery made her immediately get in touch with Caspar and rush towards the Commandment Mount together with him.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, Luo Zheng asked her why the Picture Slab had recorded the events that transpired that day. At this, Mu Ning didn't answer but gave a small chuckle. She was rather unwilling to tell Luo Zheng the truth.</p>

  <p>"Today, they have said sorry to you and the matter has come to an end, but the saints have been infuriated. I am not fearful of them, but I am afraid that they would take revenge against you!" Mu Ning said.</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng nodded in understanding.</p>

  <p>"I am very aware of this. Even if it isn't because of this thing, they will definitely refuse to let go of me.</p>

  <p>But like them, I won't leave them off the hook either, especially Saint Viana and Saint Adrian!" he said.</p>

  <p>He was certain that he had annoyed the saints today because they were forced to apologize to him in public. When Mu Ning heard Zheng's arrogant words, she only sighed heavily. Just now, she had forgotten who Luo Zheng was.</p>

  <p>Deep inside her, she knew that Luo Zheng would not show that much hatred if he himself was hurt. However, if anyone dared to hurt any of his close relatives, it was beyond doubt that Luo Zheng would make them repay it at much higher costs.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't act so ruthlessly this time... This reflected that Luo Zheng was humane.</p>

  <p>"Well, let's save those for the future. Depending on your current strength, you are still unable to confront a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm, let alone these saints. To save your little sister, you have to further enhance your strength,"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning chided once again after a few moments.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng simply nodded in agreement at her words, and walked out of the Commandment Hall with Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>After taking the trial for slaying demons and the journey to the fairy palace, Luo Zheng had really improved his strength by a mile and immediately become a nature creature.</p>

  <p>Outside the Imperial Capital, a nature creature would almost always occupy a dominant position and be powerful enough to maintain the survival of a small clan.</p>

  <p>However, a nature creature meant nothing at all inside the Burning Sky Imperial Capital and Cloud Sect, where many people had reached even much higher levels.</p>

  <p>Upon his return, Luo Zheng decided to set another goal for himself and then concentrated on diligent cultivation.</p>

  <p>When he had returned to Drizzle Peak as its outer disciple once again, awe from the people and a sense of pride washed over him.</p>

  <p>His amazing feats in the trial for killing demons had been spread and rumored among the outer disciples for quite a long time.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng became an outer disciple of Drizzle Peak, Henry ranked number one among all outer disciples.</p>

  <p>However, in the trial for slaying demons, it turned out that Henry was no match for Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has slain a demon general!"</p>

  <p>"Lenard, the one from the Skytop Peak, has been only capable of breaking even with the demon general in the trial. However, Luo Zheng has even put the demon general to death!" These words of praise were showered upon Luo Zheng. It was even said that the whole Skytop Peak would have been totally defeated if it hadn't been for him.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng didn't merely kill one demon general. According to the news from the Lady Peak, Luo Zheng even slew several demon generals together!"</p>

  <p>These outer disciples murmured to themselves and sighed at Zheng's fearsome strength at the same time. They had also sensed and encountered the evil spirit of the demons, but they already found it hard to resist the evil spirit of even just one demon soldier.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Luo Zheng could even defeat demon generals. He had surely made an idol out of himself among the outer disciples.</p>

  <p>He had far transcended all of them and even Henry. Thus, a majority of the outer disciples firmly believed that even no inner disciple of Drizzle Peak could beat Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Wow! Brother, I have news for you. You are famous now!" Across the distance, Nory and Sean had spotted Luo Zheng. They rushed over to him and enveloped him in a bear hug.</p>

  <p>After a while, they both stepped aside. Then, Wurth immediately wrapped Luo Zheng in another bear hug.</p>

  <p>Soon after having caught up with each other, the four of them walked towards a restaurant. Since Luo Zheng had just come back, they naturally wanted to dine together and indulge in a feast of drinking.</p>

  <p>Both Wurth and Sean were very excited. Before Zheng's return, they had already heard different rumors about his excursions. At first, they even doubted if Luo Zheng had really confronted a demon general. However, Cleve told them in person that it was true and so, they finally realized that there was nothing impossible for Luo Zheng in this world.</p>

  <p>Although Cleve wasn't in the list of top five among inner disciples, he had been strong and valiant enough. With that in mind, it was impossible for Cleve to talk nonsense.</p>

  <p>The thought of the demon general and his strength still sent shivers up their spines. Even a mere glance from the demon general would frighten them out of their wits, but Luo Zheng was capable of even slaying the demon general, and just by himself. Compared with general outer disciples, he was far stronger. Therefore, although they had believed that Luo Zheng had succeeded in killing the demon general, deep inside them, they still felt it was a truly incredible feat for Luo Zheng to have achieved.</p>

  <p>While they were eating and talking between plates and plates of delicious food, Luo Zheng noticed that Nory looked a little unhappy and uneasy.</p>

  <p>He cast a worried glance at his friend.</p>

  <p>"Nory, you seem to have something in mind. What's wrong?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Nory was from the Imperial Capital. He usually acted a little mindlessly.</p>

  <p>This made it seem that nothing could ever displease him. Now he looked kind of sad, so Luo Zheng thought that something must have happened.</p>

  <p>At Zheng's curious questioning, Nory's eyes suddenly widened in mild surprise.</p>

  <p>"Ahh, it's nothing! Luo Zheng, I feel happy to see you come back today. Come on! Cheer up!" Nory said. He lifted his cup in the air to toast with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The more Nory behaved that way to conceal his true feelings, the more Luo Zheng felt that something was off. Instead of lifting his cup up, Luo Zheng asked,</p>

  <p>"Just tell me frankly if you treat me as your close friend."</p>

  <p>As soon as the words tumbled out from Zheng's mouth, both Wurth and Sean slowly shifted their gazes to Nory. At this moment, they had also noticed that Nory behaved a little weirdly.</p>

  <p>After a short pause, Nory suddenly smiled at them. "In fact, it is not a big deal. My family is going to hold a party next month. In fact, our Mo Family is also a noble clan, but lags relatively behind among noble clans..." he replied.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Nory's words, Wurth asked, "Nory, are you from the Mo family in the northern part of the city?"</p>

  <p>Wurth's family ran businesses in almost all areas of the Imperial Capital, so he clearly knew about almost all of the families in that capital. Hence, he immediately guessed which Nory's family was when Nory told them that his family was also a noble clan.</p>
