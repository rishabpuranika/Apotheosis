<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was the first real Godly Way Tablet that Zheng had ever seen, and it made his curiosity perk up.</p>

  <p>Since he wasn't in a hurry to leave, he flew down the mountain ravine.</p>

  <p>On the huge cyan Godly Way Tablet, there were flashes of blue lightning that extended along it and spread into the surrounding ground like little snakes.</p>

  <p>Not a blade of grass grew within tens of thousands of feet around the cyan Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>In exchange, there were tens of thousands of people sitting around it to stare.</p>

  <p>All of them came to get more insight into the internal momentum of the tablet and improve.</p>

  <p>While most of the people were very far, there was a few people dared to come within ten thousand feet of the Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>The closer they were to the Godly Way Tablet, the greater the pressure of the internal momentum.</p>

  <p>If proving godly warriors came too close to a Godly Way Tablet, they would be like moths flying into flames and be swallowed by the internal momentum. Zheng had experienced it when he was in the Consulting God Hall of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Zheng flew down and quietly landed on the ground. He slowly walked towards the Godly Way Tablet after he hid his cultivation level.</p>

  <p>"It turns out to be the Thunderstorm Godly Way..." A flash appeared in his eyes as he approached the tablet.</p>

  <p>It was an extremely common Godly Way in the divine land, and even Zheng had seen several True Gods use it.</p>

  <p>Zheng had recorded the Godly Way using his Infinity Ruler, which should be almost perfect.</p>

  <p>But since his father had given him the Infinity Ruler for a reason, he still wanted to verify the Godly Way again. If it was possible, Zheng would definitely visit all the Godly Way Tablets in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Hey! Stop!"</p>

  <p>When Zheng was still over ten miles away from the Godly Way Tablet, three top-rank True Gods flew over from the distance.</p>

  <p>The three suddenly appeared and blocked Zheng from going further.</p>

  <p>A cold and arrogant expression appeared on the face of the True God in the lead as he stared at Zheng. "Do you also want to learn from the Godly Way Tablet?"</p>

  <p>There was a pause as Zheng looked them up and down before he nodded and answered, "Yes, I also want to learn from the Godly Way Tablet."</p>

  <p>"This Godly Way Tablet belongs to our Fang Clan. If you want to learn from it, you have to pay twenty divine might coins and serve our clan for two hundred years!" the lead True God said coolly.</p>

  <p>His words made Zheng frown.</p>

  <p>If the Godly Way Tablet was owned by the Fang Clan, then the large region was theirs too.</p>

  <p>Time was worthless to most of the True Gods in the divine land; two hundred years was very short.</p>

  <p>In order to comprehend a Godly Way to a higher level, spending two hundred years was nothing.</p>

  <p>That being said, twenty divine might coins wasn't a big deal to Zheng, but he couldn't afford to waste time.</p>

  <p>His visible hesitation made the True God snort. "If you don't want to pay and serve our clan, get out of here!"</p>

  <p>Because Zheng didn't want to cause any trouble, he smiled and came closer to him to whisper, "I don't want to serve your clan, but I can offer more divine might coins. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Those words made the three top-rank True Gods' eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>The True Gods that came all the way to the Godly Way Tablet were all from poor families, because if they were from a strong family, their mighty warriors would have just gotten a copy and taught their fellow clan members the complete Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Two hundred years didn't matter to those from poor families, but having to pay twenty divine might coins made their hearts ache.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng was willing to pay more coins, they were more than happy to accept.</p>

  <p>"Of course you can. If you don't want to serve, you need to pay an extra fifty divine might coins. So seventy coins in total." The lead laughed at him.</p>

  <p>Normally, an extra twenty divine might coins was enough if one didn't want to serve the Fang Clan, but of course they were charging too much.</p>

  <p>It was Zheng's idea so they naturally expected to be able to rip him off. The three of them could share the extra thirty divine might coins.</p>

  <p>"Okay." Twenty or fifty or seventy meant nothing to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even the powerful clans on the Floating Islands were far inferior to him with his current collection of divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Carelessly waving his hand, Zheng handed over seventy divine might coins.</p>

  <p>The leader greedily took the coins and waved him off. "You can go!"</p>

  <p>Zheng cupped his hands and walked through the crowd towards the Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>Once he was far enough away, the three top-rank True Gods quickly divided up the divine might coins.</p>

  <p>"That guy easily took out seventy divine might coins. You should have given a higher price!"</p>

  <p>"That's right! He must have a lot with him!"</p>

  <p>In their greedy eyes, Zheng was obviously a money tree.</p>

  <p>Even the leader regretfully followed Zheng's back with his eyes. If he knew that Zheng was that generous, he would have offered two hundred divine might coins as the price. A chance like this wasn't common!</p>

  <p>"He's alone without any support. When he leaves, we can follow and kill him." There was nothing but murder on his face.</p>

  <p>"That's a good idea." Another True God laughed as he rubbed his hands together.</p>

  <p>Although the three of them kept their voices down, Zheng could still hear them clearly for his eyes and ears far exceeded a normal True God's.</p>

  <p>It seemed that some idiots, even if they became True Gods, would inevitably die of greed.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had no time to worry about them.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum of this Godly Way Tablet was much more powerful than that of the imitation in the ancestral land of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>When Zheng was less than ten thousand feet away from the Godly Way Tablet, dazzling arcs of lightning shot out from the barren land and spread along his legs.</p>

  <p>It horrified the proving godly warriors and even the low-rank True Gods present to see it.</p>

  <p>Only those with an extraordinary understanding of the Thunderstorm Godly Way dared to enter the range of ten thousand feet; most of them were top-rank True Gods, and some were even consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Because Zheng hid his true cultivation level, he was now a bold low-rank True God in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"He's simply courting death!"</p>

  <p>"I think he can only move forward for a few hundred feet!"</p>

  <p>"Doing that is still extremely difficult..."</p>

  <p>Others were shocked to see his actions, but Zheng was walking as leisurely as he would in his courtyard.</p>

  <p>The closer he got to the Godly Way Tablet, the more lightning bolts extended to him.</p>

  <p>Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, he had already traveled four thousand feet. Thunder snakes, each as thick as an arm, emerged and enveloped Zheng in many layers.</p>

  <p>The three top-rank True Gods, tens of thousands of feet away, suddenly had a bad feeling.</p>

  <p>Even they could only get four or five thousand feet away from the Godly Way Tablet to study the Thunderstorm Godly Way.</p>

  <p>This guy was just a low-rank True God, yet he was now four thousand feet away from the tablet and seemed like he had no intention of stopping.</p>

  <p>As the stewards of the Fang Clan, the three of them had to consider Zheng's background and identity.</p>
