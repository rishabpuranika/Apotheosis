  <p>
</p>

  <p>The several silver moons rapidly flipped in the air until the Slaughtering Moonlight Array, which had been disturbed by Ramzi, quickly fell back into position.</p>

  <p>Once the messy silver moons returned to their quiet and orderly selves, Clement picked up his blood sword again.</p>

  <p>Ramzi felt his eyesight drifting out of focus, but he braced himself and activated the Image Disrupting Array in an attempt to disturb the Slaughtering Moonlight Array once again.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, Clement secretly winked at the Yellow Emperor Guard who was on the other side and sent him a message through his life vitality. "It's your turn, Len."</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guard called Len was really good at employing the soul attack.</p>

  <p>However, his soul attack only worked on those who were unprepared, so he had yet to launch an attack during this battle.</p>

  <p>For the past few days, Ramzi had maintained the Image Disrupting Array to combat the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. The slightest mistake or negligence on his part could lead to several deaths, so he had been on constant edge and under great pressure. Moreover, maintaining the Image Disrupting Array consumed a lot of soul power.</p>

  <p>Clement had sensed that Ramzi's soul power was almost exhausted, so he thought that this was the perfect time for Len to launch an attack.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The yellow paper produced by Ramzi exploded. The Image Disrupting Array he was maintaining also flashed a pale yellow luster. At this critical moment, a light green demonic statue suddenly appeared above Len's head.</p>

  <p>The statue was strange-looking and had a mustache on its face. As soon as it appeared, it let out a sharp scream that cut through the air.</p>

  <p>Woo, woo...</p>

  <p>A powerful rush of soul pressure spread out along with its voice.</p>

  <p>The faces of Emily, Timotheus, Leopold, and the other warriors at the Other Shore Realm all darkened. With their strength, they managed to resist the soul attack.</p>

  <p>Mike and Lorena, however, felt as if their souls had been pricked by needles. The intense soul pain made their faces turn pale.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Quick, go and help Ramzi!"</p>

  <p>"His soul power is exhausted. I'm afraid he can't hold on!"</p>

  <p>Emily was the first to jump to action. With a flick of her hand, she conjured up a colorful necklace that could help the wearer resist the soul attack.</p>

  <p>Then, she slightly waved her hand and made the necklace fall over Ramzi's head and settle around his neck.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it was too late. Ramzi was already like a spent arrow. Even without the soul attack, he couldn't hold on any longer. The moment the sharp voice spread into his soul, his eyes rolled to the back of his head and he passed out with a thud.</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff...</p>

  <p>The yellow paper dispersed around the Image Disrupting Array and soon the entire array disintegrated.</p>

  <p>"Haha!"</p>

  <p>Clement let out a chuckle and gently waved his silver blood sword.</p>

  <p>Without the protection of Ramzi's Image Disrupting Array, no one could resist the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. When Clement brandished his blood sword, Emily narrowed her eyes, gritted her teeth, and grabbed Ramzi in the air before dragging him a foot away.</p>

  <p>She didn't know whom Clement would attack, but since Ramzi was the only one who could disturb the Slaughtering Moonlight Array, she guessed that Clement would try to finish him off first.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Just as she had guessed, Ramzi's legs were suddenly cut by an invisible force.</p>

  <p>"It's useless to struggle. You can save him, but can you save yourself?" said Clement with a small smile. He hadn't expected that Emily would take action.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he waved his blood sword in the air once again.</p>

  <p>Emily's eyes narrowed, and she swiftly dodged his attack.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>The Nine Li Guard next to her, however, didn't react as quickly. A wound appeared in the middle of his forehead and blood spurted out. The Nine Li Guard was cut in half and his eyes were filled with confusion and resentment as he fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Leopold and Timotheus cried out simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Emily quickly got up from the ground and glared at Clement with utter hatred.</p>

  <p>Clement, on the other hand, continued to smile at Emily. "I didn't say I would kill you, but maybe next..."</p>

  <p>"Let's just fight him head on!" shouted Leopold.</p>

  <p>He couldn't stand it anymore. If they were going to be killed anyway, it was better to fight to the death.</p>

  <p>Timotheus's eyes also flashed with fury. The remaining Nine Li Guards and the members of the Snake Goddess race were eager to fight.</p>

  <p>"Fight me head on?" Clement still looked as relaxed as ever. "Have you forgotten that you are trapped by the Slaughtering Moonlight Array? How can you even think of fighting me?"</p>

  <p>With that, he raised his blood sword, and the silver moons in the sky emitted a bright light.</p>

  <p>As he shook the blood sword gently, an invisible force spread out.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt like the situation was hopeless because they couldn't predict whom Clement would attack next. His attacks were simply irresistible.</p>

  <p>Even Emily and Timotheus, who had extraordinary fighting skills, found it difficult to dodge his attacks.</p>

  <p>Standing protectively in front of Lorena, Mike activated the Evolution Divine Dao. The wheels in his head began churning.</p>

  <p>It was a difficult task for him to speculate about the thoughts of a person who was stronger than him. Fortunately, there were not many people in the Slaughtering Moonlight Array, so there were very few variables to take into account.</p>

  <p>Mike pushed the Evolution Divine Dao to the limit and finally got the result the moment Clement brandished his sword.</p>

  <p>With a determined look on his face, Mike turned around and jumped, knocking Lorena to the ground with him. Less than a split second later, an invisible force spiraled over their heads but soon disappeared silently.</p>

  <p>"Impressive." A look of surprise could be seen on Clement's face. "You are merely a True God, but you can figure out what I'm thinking. That's very interesting. But can you really avoid my attack?"</p>

  <p>"Princess!" the Nine Li Guards all cried out at once.</p>

  <p>They were more concerned about Lorena's safety than the others'.</p>

  <p>Before Mike and Lorena could get up from the ground, Clement launched another strike and an invisible force swiftly shot toward them.</p>

  <p>This time, the two of them had no way of dodging Clement's attack.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was all happening in such a short time that no one could step in to help them. Even the Nine Li Guards who were running toward them had helpless looks on their faces.</p>

  <p>Mike had no choice but to hold Lorena in his arms, his heart sinking into despair.</p>

  <p>It was not a big deal for him to be killed by the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. After all, he could come back to life in his universe. Lorena, however, had no chance of coming back if she were to die.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, the invisible force seemed to bump into something and made a crisp sound.</p>

  <p>Everyone was stunned. So far, no one had been able to stop Clement's attacks, not even Emily and Timotheus.</p>

  <p>Clement himself was taken aback, unable to figure out what was going on.</p>

  <p>As he stared intently at Lorena and Mike, he saw a blue shadow of triangle shield gradually emerge in front of them. It was this shield that had blocked his strike.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Mirror Shield?"</p>

  <p>Timotheus, Emily, and Leopold were stunned.</p>

  <p>Clement frowned in confusion. When he had led the Yellow Emperor Guards to the divine land, he had tried to break the outer layer of the divine land, only to be stopped by the Heavenly Mirror Shield.</p>

  <p>But normally, the Heavenly Mirror Shield only protected the divine land.</p>

  <p>Why was it taking the initiative to protect people now?</p>
