<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Gianni covered the snake-shaped mark with his hand and ordered, "Run!"</p>

  <p>"But?" Hamilton said reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"What are you waiting for? Go, now!" Gianni roared.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Alphonse glanced at Gianni and also commanded, "All of you, take your own coordinates and leave with me! I won't hear any excuse!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Alphonse took the lead and made a series of ripples on the surface of the water as he moved.</p>

  <p>The other human spirits also followed closely behind after putting away their coordinates.</p>

  <p>As Gianni saw that the images of the human spirits receded little by little in the distance, a grin gradually appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He then removed his hand, exposing the snake-shaped mark. "Gianni!</p>

  <p>What are you doing? Why aren't you attacking the bird nests?" Balfour asked in a loud voice.</p>

  <p>"In a minute," Gianni replied.</p>

  <p>"Why? What happened? Why did you even hesitate?" Balfour continued asking.</p>

  <p>"Some bird spirits blocked us halfway. It wasn't a wise decision to recklessly attack them," Gianni lied with a straight face.</p>

  <p>"But you're the only one left!" Through the snake-shaped mark, Balfour immediately found out that something wrong was going on.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap and stop being nosy!" Gianni snapped back, losing his patience.</p>

  <p>He suddenly reached out his hand and tapped the snake-shaped mark which instantly trembled and broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>Balfour was taken aback when he was suddenly reprimanded by Gianni.</p>

  <p>He fell silent for a while before he was able to let out an angry roar.</p>

  <p>It was too late for him to confirm what had really happened.</p>

  <p>Everything could only be verified after the end of the attack. After all, the thirteenth round of attack had already begun, so it was far beyond the reach of his power.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the fierce battle between the Snake Spirit Sect and the Bird Spirit Sect, the human spirits of the three houses quickly left the battlefield situated in the Wine Basin.</p>

  <p>They bypassed the Mist City and the checkpoint of the Snake Spirit Sect, and took the opportunity to head straight into the center of the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>However, this didn't go unnoticed in the eyes of the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>When the thirteenth round of attack from the Snake Spirit Sect began, Cornelius, the Snake Spirit King, finally made his appearance in the Wine Basin.</p>

  <p>There was an amber-colored diamond-shaped gem embedded in Cornelius's head, which was a Holy Item called the Limited Omnipotent Stone.</p>

  <p>With the aid of this gem, he was able to see everything within a limited area. Thus, everything that was happening in the Jade Pure Realm couldn't escape from his eyes.</p>

  <p>Previously, when Dale returned to the bubble, he had been captured by Cornelius. Then, Sewell quietly sent the coordinates into the bubble afterward.</p>

  <p>"There are some deserters," Cornelius said in an annoyed tone.</p>

  <p>Surprise instantly appeared in Sewell's eyes as he heard what the Snake Spirit King said. "Who dares to escape?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The human spirits from the three houses," Cornelius answered briefly.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll go and capture them right now," Sewell quickly responded.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King looked at the edge of the Wine Basin and shook his head. "There's no need to do that. We don't have to deal with them personally. Besides, there's nowhere they can go that I can't see. What we need to focus on is the Bird Spirit King."</p>

  <p>On the peninsula behind the Wine Basin, the bird spirits used the rare gold threads to make a huge nest. On the nest was a giant bird that looked like a swan. His wings appeared to be symmetrical rhombuses, like two magnificent crystal mines as they were spread out.</p>

  <p>The giant bird's head was resting on the ground of the nest, motionless.</p>

  <p>His eyes remained wide open, and they were now filled with so much chaos and killing intent.</p>

  <p>"They should be punished.</p>

  <p>No one is innocent in this world, and I have to remove all their sins.</p>

  <p>Those snakes are the root cause of all sins!" the giant bird said in his sleep.</p>

  <p>It was Sheehan, the Bird Spirit King. For countless years now, he had been crawling on the ground in this position.</p>

  <p>Even in his unconscious state, he still had a lot of appetite for destruction.</p>

  <p>Therefore, even as a Treacherous Being, his combat effectiveness was still terrifying. This was the very reason why the Snake Spirit King had never dared to take him down before.</p>

  <p>"Our king! You don't have to concern yourself with this skirmish."</p>

  <p>"We can take care of them on our own."</p>

  <p>"That's right! We, the bird spirits, can't be defeated by them!"</p>

  <p>Three Bird Masters bowed before the Bird Spirit King and kept on persuading him not to leave the nest.</p>

  <p>The leader of the three Bird Masters was called Lawler. He was ranked first in terms of strength among all the Bird Masters. The second was Duran, and the third was Orval. They all wore a suit of heavy armor that made them look like giant reptiles instead of birds.</p>

  <p>The three of them were supposed to participate in the battle happening at the Wine Basin. However, when they knew that the Bird Spirit King wanted to set out personally, they had no choice but to stay behind and persuade their king to change his mind.</p>

  <p>The problem was Sheehan wasn't totally awake. His subconsciousness was what made him move.</p>

  <p>Since he had turned into a Treacherous Being, he had been so full of resentment towards everything in the world. It was his obsession to destroy everything.</p>

  <p>In fact, the three Bird Masters were already killed by him countless times.</p>

  <p>This had been going on for many years. Actually, the Bird Spirit King's thirst for destruction had not been that vigorous recently. He might have gotten tired, or perhaps part of his wish had been satisfied already.</p>

  <p>However, the fact remained that his wish was still to destroy everything.</p>

  <p>Although the Bird Masters knew that Sheehan wasn't on his right mind, as his subordinates, they had no choice but to stay loyal to him. They were even willing to ruin the entire chaos if they had to.</p>

  <p>It was because they knew that this was the only way to truly wake their king up.</p>

  <p>"I can't sit idly by! They have caused my people to suffer. I will kill them all if that's what I need to do," Sheehan muttered in his sleep.</p>

  <p>"We can do that ourselves. We're also Treacherous Beings that could revive repeatedly. Please, my king, let us handle this," Lawler pleaded.</p>

  <p>The truth was the Bird Spirit Sect was already in great trouble, but Lawler still chose to hide it from Sheehan.</p>

  <p>"Those snake spirits are getting closer and closer!" Sheehan suddenly raised his head and looked straight ahead in the direction of the Wine Basin. "He has appeared. He finally dares to come for me!" Sheehan's expression changed drastically.</p>

  <p>He got so excited that there was a huge smile on his face while still emitting strong killing intent.</p>

  <p>The light purple gleam on his every feather began to shine brightly.</p>

  <p>Clatter! Clatter!</p>

  <p>He gradually raised his head and body.</p>

  <p>The hard diamond-shaped feathers collided with each other, producing a sound likened to a handful of shells banging together. It was both crisp and harsh.</p>

  <p>Although the golden nest was still quite far from the battlefield, his eyes were already focused on the image of the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Sheehan only had one wish.</p>

  <p>What he wanted the most was to kill Cornelius and then crush the whole world to ruin.</p>

  <p>One could only imagine how cruel and desperate he had been before he died.</p>

  <p>"My king! Please listen to us. You can't act rashly!"</p>

  <p>"This is the Snake Spirit King's ploy. He wants to lure you out!"</p>

  <p>"You mustn't go out right now."</p>

  <p>The three Bird Masters were extremely anxious as they pleaded before their king.</p>

  <p>However, because Sheehan was still unconscious, he wasn't able to think clearly. The words of the three Bird Masters fell into deaf ears.</p>

  <p>Clatter! Clatter!</p>

  <p>Sheehan had no intention to stop now.</p>

  <p>Streaks of purple light danced around his wings, and the surrounding space twisted and cooperated in his every move.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>In an instant, the three Bird Masters were left there as the Bird Spirit King disappeared. He only left streaks of purple lights that extended towards the battlefield in the Wine Basin.</p>
