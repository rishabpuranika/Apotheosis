<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The supreme sorcerer, who was standing outside the Cloud Hall, sensed the danger. The Soul Devouring Shadow he had released was killed and just as his face clouded with anger, a soft voice rang out.</p>

  <p>"I've discovered you too." A white figure appeared by the supreme sorcerer's side.</p>

  <p>The supreme sorcerer felt the cold blade of a sword against his neck.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" the wielder of the sword said angrily, without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The short sword suddenly blossomed into a strong ray of light and made its way towards the supreme sorcerer.</p>

  <p>The supreme sorcerer's sparkling body spread out suddenly, transforming into a glow of green light that scattered crazily everywhere.</p>

  <p>But before anyone could react, the green light went up to gather above the clouds.</p>

  <p>When the green light had condensed back into the body of the supreme sorcerer, there was a wound on his neck that looked like it could not be healed. In the darkness of the night, green blood gushed out from the wound. It was evident that the sword had struck him hard.</p>

  <p>Just as his body began to congeal, the white figure appeared behind the supreme sorcerer like a shadow.</p>

  <p>He slashed out again with the short sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>The supreme sorcerer's expression shifted. He transformed into a number of green lights and scattered in all directions, flying into the back of space this time.</p>

  <p>The white figure sneered and followed them into the space.</p>

  <p>It was a battle between two supreme beings. The explosive power that erupted could destroy the heavens and earth. Even a massive supreme world couldn't withstand it, much less this great world.</p>

  <p>The white figure followed the supreme sorcerer every time he condensed.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>The white figure waved the exquisite short sword in his hand, causing a sword light to flash off of it. The sword light spiraled, turned into an Eight-diagram Wheel, and headed towards the supreme sorcerer.</p>

  <p>Now that they were on the other side of the world and the white figure had nothing to worry about, he released his full power.</p>

  <p>The power of the sword light was overwhelming.</p>

  <p>The sword light penetrated the supreme sorcerer's body, and emerged from his back. It gradually disappeared but not before it had reached tens of millions of miles.</p>

  <p>From afar, the sword light looked as bright as the Milky Way, cutting through the night.</p>

  <p>He had been executing this strike in the void.</p>

  <p>If this sword strike were to be used in the Central Region, it could cut apart the great world and reach the end of the world. It could even break through the barrier of the great world and pass through the connected great world.</p>

  <p>Green blood gushed out. The supreme sorcerer was obviously injured, but he did not show his fear. He only looked at the white figure and said,</p>

  <p>"I was wondering who it was. Supreme Lord Sky- Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>"How could your ancient sorcerer race kill the Godly Geniuses under the protection of my Celestial Position?" Supreme Lord Sky said. The exquisite sword in his hand glinted dangerously.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race never thought much of the ancient sorcerer race even though the ancient sorcerers were a little troublesome for them.</p>

  <p>Celestial Position could crush them easily.</p>

  <p>For Celestial Position, the real danger came from their enemies behind the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" The supreme sorcerer laughed coldly. "Since Supreme Lord Sky has arrived, the one who extinguished my Soul Devouring Shadow in the hall should be Supreme Lord Mirage. I wonder if Supreme Lord Mirage can beat Torch Dragon. Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>This supreme sorcerer knew that the Celestial Position had prepared a backup plan. Under these circumstances, he still dared kill the Godly Geniuses, which meant that he naturally had a backup plan too.</p>

  <p>At this, Supreme Lord Sky narrowed his eyes and said coldly, "You've already awakened the Torch Dragon. You are so ambitious!"</p>
