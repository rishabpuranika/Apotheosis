<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2971 The Wild Goose Pass </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Their choice of going through the Wild Goose Pass to get into the Source World was risky. But it was the only reasonable option they had.</p>

  <p>The Trumpet Flying Ship continued to travel along the space channel.</p>

  <p>The silence in the ship filled everyone with unrest. The pressure weighed on them like an invisible giant beast circling above their heads, waiting to consume them.</p>

  <p>Eyeing everyone up Zheng knew he had to speak to break the tension. He hesitated for a while before he gathered the courage to speak. "If there is any danger, can you run away alone?"</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at her desperately. It was not the best time to say something like this, but Yan was in Emily's inner world. He had to assure her safety.</p>

  <p>If they encountered the Yellow Emperor Guards, Zheng hoped Emily could escape so Yan would be safe.</p>

  <p>Emily glanced at Zheng indifferently. She couldn't blame him for saying that.</p>

  <p>It was understandable how he worried about his sister. He was supposed to protect her after all. She wanted Yan safe too. She thought to herself how much she wanted to take her to the Pearl Hill.</p>

  <p>Yan's protection was important to her as well. It was part of her mission.</p>

  <p>She was supposed to keep her safe.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. If we run into overwhelming danger, I will run away," Emily promised.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in approval.</p>

  <p>If they faced off against the most powerful warriors of the Yellow Emperor Guards, there was a possibility of them all getting killed. Even so, Emily's promise of escaping at the first sign of trouble made Zheng feel at ease.</p>

  <p>Three days passed by quickly.</p>

  <p>Leopold gently rubbed the jade plate in his hand. A wisp of blue light flashed in front of the Trumpet Flying Ship, allowing them to leave the space channel.</p>

  <p>As soon as the ship moved out of the space channel, a huge triangular opening came into view. They all looked up in wonder with their mouth agape at the size of it.</p>

  <p>The opening was formed by three ten million foot-long jade pillars that were connected in the shape of a triangle. Each pillar had unusual patterns etched into it. Hundreds of ships came in and out of the opening.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had seen most of the world, he was still impressed. He stared at the enormous opening with awe.</p>

  <p>"Is this the Wild Goose Pass?" Zheng asked with curious eyes.</p>

  <p>Emily nodded. She felt nostalgic returning to the Wild Goose Pass after many years. She closed her eyes as she recalled the last time she came here.</p>

  <p>However, now was not the time to get emotional. She straightened herself and glanced at Leopold before she said, "Prepare to form the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. Everyone, stay alert!"</p>

  <p>The other women of the Snake Goddess race immediately nodded to themselves. They stood on guard and prepared themselves for every possibility. In case of any incidents, they each held a divine crystal in their hands.</p>

  <p>A dozen giant flying ships were seen moving slowly at a short distance from them. Leopold noticed and began steering the Trumpet Flying Ship to follow them.</p>

  <p>Leopold came up with the idea of moving along with the cargo ships. He planned to pass through the Wild Goose Pass undetected amid the passing fleet.</p>

  <p>Above the Wild Goose Pass, Sanjay stood over the intersection of two jade pillars. He looked down and scanned all the ships that passed through the Wild Goose Pass.</p>

  <p>"I've been here for three days. According to the report from Telmo, that Trumpet Flying Ship should have arrived by now. Unless... They took a different route?"</p>

  <p>If they didn't cross the Wild Goose Pass, Sanjay could do nothing to the Trumpet Flying Ship.</p>

  <p>The Source World was too vast. It would take a long time or forever to locate the Trumpet Flying Ship. Even for a powerful master like Sanjay, it was close to impossible to monitor the entire Source World to pinpoint their location.</p>

  <p>However, it was not a trivial issue for the Yellow Emperor Guards that someone had hijacked a Trumpet Flying Ship. Even if they chose to take a different route, the Yellow Emperor Guards would still stop them. What Sanjay needed to do was to guard the Wild Goose Pass.</p>

  <p>He kept a close eye on every ship that moved through. Suddenly, his gaze fell on the dozen giant cargo ships. He quickly spotted the Trumpet Flying Ship at the side of one of the passing ships.</p>

  <p>A smirk appeared on Sanjay's face. "You finally came. I didn't expect you to use such a clumsy trick to get by. How foolish."</p>

  <p>With a gloating face, he tapped his toes lightly. He prepared himself and flew in the chaos gracefully like a white dove for some time. Then he plummeted downward quickly, leaving a white fine line in the air as he flew straight towards the Trumpet Flying Ship.</p>

  <p>Emily and the others on the Trumpet Flying Ship were alerted when they saw the white thin line streak across the sky. Sanjay wanted to make his presence known, and they sensed it.</p>

  <p>"It's coming towards us," Leopold said as his face darkened.</p>

  <p>Emily looked at the growing flying figure as it drew near, and her eyes flashed with a stern light. "Form the Slaughtering Moonlight Array...</p>

  <p>Quickly! Accelerate to rush through the Wild Goose Pass!"</p>

  <p>They couldn't use the Grand Teleportation to go through the Wild Goose Pass; they had to solely rely on the ship's speed to rush past it.</p>

  <p>After receiving the order, Leopold formed the Slaughtering Moonlight Array again. At the same time, the Trumpet Flying Ship suddenly trembled and sped up. Like a sharp arrow released from its bow, it flew towards the Wild Goose Pass.</p>

  <p>The smile on Sanjay's face grew wider as he saw the Trumpet Flying Ship constantly accelerating. He looked amused. He seemed unfazed by the ship's increasing speed to rush past the Wild Goose Pass.</p>

  <p>As he continued descending in their direction, he pulled his arm out in the air. A thick and wide sword emerged in his hand, and suddenly his speed of falling increased by more than ten times!</p>

  <p>"Woosh-"</p>

  <p>He constantly adjusted his position during his flight to approach the Trumpet Flying Ship directly.</p>

  <p>A hundred miles... Fifty miles... He closed the distance between himself and the ship. Each second that passed, he drew closer to them.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>The Slaughtering Moonlight Array was ready.</p>

  <p>Emily raised her head and studied the approaching figure in white. She braced for impact and began gathering silver moonlight in her hand.</p>

  <p>When the figure was only ten miles away from them, she gently waved her fingers in the air. At this action, a colorful circle of light emerged. It began to spread itself out into the air. The colorful circle of light later merged itself with the power of the Slaughtering Moonlight Array.</p>

  <p>She knew the person drawing near had extraordinary strength. She planned on hitting him with a deadly attack.</p>

  <p>"Hey..."</p>

  <p>Sanjay who was descending from the sky looked at the colorful circle of light with a hint of disdain on his face. The smile on his face disappeared as he stared at the light coming towards him. It was overwhelming, he had to avoid it at all costs. Acting on reflex he titled his sword. Six ghost face marks appeared on the blade. The marks came to life and let out loud howling noises that pierced through their ears.</p>

  <p>"Aooo!"</p>

  <p>The sound waves coming from the sword were colorless and formless. They appeared to only cause discomfort to the ears as they were forced to cover them from the loud noise. However, it was far more dangerous than that.</p>

  <p>Under the onslaught of the sound waves, the energy gathered at Emily's hand through the connection of the colorful light circle and the Slaughtering Moonlight Array dissipated instantly and disappeared without a trace!</p>

  <p>Emily watched in horror as her attack failed.</p>

  <p>Her face immediately turned pale and lost color.</p>

  <p>"It's the six Dragon Ghost Heads... Everyone, abandon the ship! Head to the Wild Goose Pass!"</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the ghost faces marked on the sword, she panicked. Despite that, she tried her best to compose herself and make rational judgments to guide everyone.</p>

  <p>The moment Emily gave the order, Zheng, Leopold and the other people of the Snake Goddess race quickly rushed out of the Trumpet Flying Ship and headed towards the Wild Goose Pass.</p>

  <p>Just as they rushed out of the ship, the wide sword in Sanjay's hand came slashing downwards at the ship in an attempt to obliterate them.</p>

  <p>The slash formed a strong surge of energy. The streak of light it formed was tens of thousands of feet long. The light surged and formed violent fluctuations in space. It was so strong that it made nearby ships shake from its impact.</p>

  <p>Some heads popped out of the buildings on those huge flying ships.</p>

  <p>Some of those people were powerful masters at the Other Shore Realm, but most of them were True Gods. When they saw the power of the sword in Sanjay's possession, their eyes reflected fear.</p>

  <p>However, fights like these were like routine in the Source World. As long as the battle did not involve them, they would take it as entertainment.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>With a piercing sound, the Trumpet Flying Ship went down after being struck by the blade of light. It turned to dust and drowned into space.</p>
