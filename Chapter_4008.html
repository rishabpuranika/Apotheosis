  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the cubic stone was stuffed into Luo Zheng's body, the remaining white film left outside his body split open.</p>

  <p>A ray of blue light flashed from the white film. It was a bolt of lightning almost the size of a thumb.</p>

  <p>It was the real body of Les.</p>

  <p>Les' figure had also shrunk. As the Treacherous Being had powerful strength, it wouldn't take much effort to kill Les.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that the Treacherous Being had no intent to kill Les. It started to place the remaining white film back onto Luo Zheng's body and left.</p>

  <p>The thumb-sized Les paused for a moment in surprise?he didn't expect that the Treacherous Being would let him go. He then realized that it was not a safe place.</p>

  <p>His strength had extremely weakened. Any Eternal Realm warrior could kill him now!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Les flew fast; he quickly turned into a bolt of lightning and disappeared before everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes widened when they saw Les escape safely.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being was never a kind creature. Why would it let off Les?</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Being strangely took action from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>Let's wait for the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to decipher the words it has uttered," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>When it obtained the cubic stone, the Treacherous Being let out a howl. The howl sounded like a low reciting voice to Luo Zheng's ears. Luo Zheng never missed the Treacherous Being's words. He quickly sent this recitation sound into his inner world, asking the Heavenly Obsession Civilization to decipher it.</p>

  <p>Perhaps because the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been accustomed to the characteristics of the Treacherous Being's language, or because the sentence was short, the Heavenly Obsession Civilization quickly answered,</p>

  <p>"It said the stone is called the Holy Stone."</p>

  <p>"Holy Stone?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven thought for a moment. "I've never heard of such a stone." He shook his head.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Luo Zheng said, "The stones used to make the ground and pillars of the Eternal Divine Courtyard are closely similar to that cubic stone, but I can't tell whether they're related or not."</p>

  <p>Some things looked the same, but their actual uses were different. Luo Zheng could only tell them his guess.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, what triggered the Treacherous Being must be something extraordinary.</p>

  <p>From its strange behavior at the beginning, its target seemed not to be Les, but this stone. It just took a chance to punish Les as well.</p>

  <p>As the Treacherous Being advanced for hundreds of miles, Wing King, his group, and the men in black robes also followed it.</p>

  <p>When it pushed down another pagoda mountain, a series of tremors suddenly arose from the ground. The tremors intensely spread east to the far distance.</p>

  <p>"It really opened a passage..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven said in shock.</p>

  <p>Their knowledge about the Other Shore, especially about the Supreme Pure Realm, had not been updated since the 78th chaotic era. The Primeval Lord of Heaven had never communicated with the Eternal Realm Hunters before.</p>

  <p>"I predicted that it would be like this. Entering the Jade Pure Realm through that passage was only a dream for you," the Snake Goddess uttered in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had thought he would be able to enter the Jade Pure Realm through the passage, but now it just seemed to be wishful thinking...</p>

  <p>It might not be easy to enter the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>"Which passage has the Treacherous Being opened?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait and see," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered.</p>

  <p>"The problem is how I can take my body back," Luo Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>Now, the Primeval Lord of Heaven seemed to be even more interested in the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being controlled Luo Zheng's body to run all the way west, dashing past many pagoda mountains.</p>

  <p>As it stepped further into the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, it approached a snowy land. It was the Freezing Wilderness on the west of the Myriad Pagoda Mountains.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Being became much more agile after opening the passage.</p>

  <p>It was sure of the direction it accelerated in and stepped into the Freezing Wilderness without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>The Freezing Wilderness was covered with white, beautiful snow.</p>

  <p>Many kinds of Other Shore creatures had hidden in its seemingly lifeless territory.</p>

  <p>As soon as the Treacherous Being flew a distance, a fist-sized Evil Short-beaked Sparrow emerged from the thick snow. The number of the Evil Short-beaked Sparrows was extremely large, and they liked to attack their targets in groups.</p>

  <p>The Evil Short-beaked Sparrows let out a series of chirps, as if calling out to many flocks.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of Evil Short-beaked Sparrows then came out of the snow land.</p>

  <p>The white Evil Short-beaked Sparrows looked like the snowstorm as they swept towards their prey.</p>

  <p>With the terrifying attack of the Evil Short-beaked Sparrows, ordinary Other Shore creatures could be bitten to death in only three to six seconds.</p>

  <p>This time, the situation was beyond the expectations of the Evil Short-beaked Sparrows. When all the Evil Short-beaked Sparrows came to only three feet away from their prey, a strange force had split them in half.</p>

  <p>The first one was killed in an instant, up until the 10, 000th one...</p>

  <p>Puff, puff, puff...</p>

  <p>The Evil Short-beaked Sparrows had now turned into a rain of scarlet blood falling on the snow of the Freezing Wilderness, leaving behind a bloody trail.</p>

  <p>The Wing King was following behind unhurriedly. When Pearson saw the scene, he was also amazed. "The Treacherous Being's power is really frightening. The Freezing Wilderness is even more dangerous than the Blood Swamp. It's only safe to follow Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>"The men in black robes are still following us. I don't know what they are planning to do. Should we communicate with them?" Fuxi asked, pointing behind them.</p>

  <p>Although the men in black robes did not show any hostility, Fuxi felt uneasy upon seeing them follow.</p>

  <p>"Let me do it," the Snake Goddess insisted. She turned around and glanced back at the men in black robes. "Who are you? Why have you been following us?" she asked through her life vitality.</p>

  <p>The leader of the men in black robes hesitated at first. After all, it was not a good idea to follow them all the way. When he heard the voice, he replied,</p>

  <p>"We are from the Night Being race. We bring no harm. We are here to help."</p>

  <p>"The Night Being race?" the Snake Goddess asked as she had never heard of this race.</p>

  <p>Pearson's eyes flashed. "They are a race living in the Dark Region and they have a similar appearance to human beings. They have been staying in the Dark Region. Their bodies are pale and colorless, and their hair is as white as snow. They are considered a powerful race."</p>

  <p>Even without Pearson's description, one could tell their figures according to their thick robes.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to help us?" the Snake Goddess asked again.</p>

  <p>"The eggs of the six-headed eagles are of great importance to us.</p>

  <p>Previously, dozens of our members have died for them. Thanks to our benefactor, we obtained the eggs," the leader of the Night Being race replied.</p>

  <p>The Wing King and his group also saw the members of the Night Being race taking away the eggs. They didn't expect these eggs to be of so much importance to this race.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Snake Goddess knew that the "benefactor" the leader mentioned was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for help here. You can go back now," the Snake Goddess coldly said.</p>

  <p>The situation was complicated. She didn't want such an unknown alien race to get involved. It was impossible to determine if they had evil intentions just by a few words.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Night Being race suddenly replied, "I know that our benefactor's body is possessed by the Treacherous Being. Although the hostility-level Treacherous Being is very powerful, it lacks self-awareness.</p>

  <p>Thus, it is possible to get rid of it."</p>
