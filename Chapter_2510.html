<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2510 The Underground </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Harold and Luo Zheng proceeded further down the layer of gangue, which was several thousand feet deep.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a loud bang came from below. Something had blocked Harold's path.</p>

  <p>"Should we continue digging even after we arrive at the flint layer?" asked Harold.</p>

  <p>Flint was a translucent crystal, and it was a hundred times tougher than the gangue.</p>

  <p>No matter how tough the flint was, it couldn't stop Harold.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. It seems that this is the wrong direction," Luo Zheng said with a frown.</p>

  <p>There was some reaction in his inner world the last time he went underground.</p>

  <p>The brown mud, known as the Spiritual Darkness, seemed to have a strong attraction to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But this time around, even after going so deep into the underground, his inner world still didn't have any reaction, which meant that they had deviated in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the last time, Luo Zheng had dug down in the territory of the Tie Clan, and finally escaped from the top of the cave, which led to a pond in the backyard of the Tie Clan.</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Zheng had come to the conclusion that the underground cave could change and move freely.</p>

  <p>But his mother had asked him to look for her in the Six-Burden Region, so there must be no problem here.</p>

  <p>"Let's go that way." Luo Zheng could only rely on his internal compass to find the direction by instinct.</p>

  <p>Harold nodded. Instead of digging further in the layer of flint, he moved horizontally on the layer of gangue.</p>

  <p>However, they had traveled horizontally on the layer of gangue for a long distance, but Luo Zheng's inner world still showed no reaction. In the end, they had no choice but to stop.</p>

  <p>"Do you think your mother has left this place?" asked Harold with a frown.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "No, she said she would wait for me here. She won't leave before I find her."</p>

  <p>"But don't forget that the woman you saw in the debate venue isn't really your mother," warned Harold.</p>

  <p>The Lorena in the debate venue was just an incarnation of fear. She was merely a replica, not the real deal.</p>

  <p>This meant that the real Lorena was clueless about the fact that her son was coming for her. She didn't have any memory of what happened in the debate venue either.</p>

  <p>If Lorena chose to leave this place before Luo Zheng arrived, how would he ever find her?</p>

  <p>"You are right," Luo Zheng said dejectedly. His eyebrows twitched.</p>

  <p>It was next to impossible for him to find his mother here.</p>

  <p>"No," Luo Zheng said with a smile. "Even if the woman I saw at the debate venue was an incarnation of fear or my mother's replica, she still had a complete memory. Since she told me to seek her out here, she had a strong reason to believe that her real self won't leave this place!"</p>

  <p>"What you're saying does sound reasonable," said Harold, shrugging his shoulders. "In that case, let's go on."</p>

  <p>With that, he took two steps backward, and a kind of ox-like strength burst out of his body. He clenched his fists and rushed toward the layer of flint beneath.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>It sounded like frying beans as the thick layer of flint under his feet cracked open.</p>

  <p>In a short while, Luo Zheng could see that the layer of flint under his feet was turning into semi-transparent ash, and collapsing rapidly like quicksand.</p>

  <p>'Such powerful strength!'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was shocked inwardly.</p>

  <p>Even if he used his prime strength source, there was no comparison between his strength and Harold's.</p>

  <p>"Follow me," Harold nodded at Luo Zheng and jumped into the tunnel he had just created.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed him into the tunnel without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The layer of flint was much thicker than the layer of gangue so they slid smoothly for five thousand feet along the narrow space.</p>

  <p>When they stopped falling, they heard a dull sound from the tunnel wall.</p>

  <p>It sounded like something was going to come out of the wall.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as his senses were heightened.</p>

  <p>They had been under the ground for a very long time, and they hadn't encountered anything. So this mysterious sound, which might indicate the presence of someone or something, was a welcome event for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Harold's fingers lightly drilled into the wall and he abruptly banged on the wall with one hand.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The wall had collapsed.</p>

  <p>And at the same time, a roar was heard by Luo Zheng and Harold.</p>

  <p>A huge snake head suddenly popped out from the wall!</p>

  <p>The snake opened its bloody mouth in an attempt to swallow the two of them in one gulp.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" said Harold seeming completely unaffected by this dangerous snake. The blood vessels in his right arm emitted multicolored lights, which were the colors of his strength source. Infinite power gathered in his right arm.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Even a casual, light punch of his had the power to shatter almost everything.</p>

  <p>Before the huge snake head could snap its jaws shut, it had turned into dust from the impact of the deadly punch.</p>

  <p>The punch shot through a long distance, and Luo Zheng couldn't see what was going on so far away. Presumably, the snake had turned to dust!</p>

  <p>"An earthly snake actually dared to attack sneakily! But it is good at making holes in the ground. We can look for your mother in the holes it has made," suggested Harold.</p>

  <p>The earthly snake was about twenty feet in diameter, and so was the cave in flint layer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Harold entered the tunnels created by the earthly snake and continued onward, but they still hadn't found any clue.</p>

  <p>They continued going further down the cave. It was hard to tell how far they had traveled.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Luo Zheng felt that the ground under his feet had become soft.</p>

  <p>"We have arrived at the layer of soft stones," explained Harold as he stepped on the new terrain.</p>

  <p>Beneath the layer of gangue was the layer of flint, and below that was the layer of soft stones.</p>

  <p>As the name suggested, the soft stone was not as hard as flint, but it was extremely malleable. It could not be penetrated by force alone.</p>

  <p>Even Harold couldn't break it easily.</p>

  <p>With all these obstacles, exploring the depths of the divine land was no mean feat! This was also the reason why Lorena chose to hide underground.</p>

  <p>"We have reached the deep underground, haven't we?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"You are right," said Harold. "If we go past these soft stones and keep moving further down, we will encounter the Lethal Fire Magma. The green magma can kill the Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Luo Zheng asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>Harold nodded. "That's the purest energy in the divine land, and also the foundation for maintaining the entire divine land. We can't continue anymore. Let's look for your mother somewhere else," he proposed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was reluctant to leave. The underground world was so large and finding a particular cave was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>However, he had to follow Harold's orders or advice whatever you might term it.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to leave with Harold, he suddenly felt a hint of warmth coming from his inner world!</p>

  <p>So he stopped immediately and looked around frantically.</p>

  <p>His inner world was programmed to have such a reaction only when the mud was very close to him!</p>
