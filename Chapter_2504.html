<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mike was a Holy Being, but his knowledge was no greater than that of other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>At the very beginning, all the creatures in the divine land, including the Holy Beings, had thought that they were the only creatures in the chaos, and that the divine land was the only world.</p>

  <p>It was not until they found a large number of Sanskrit words that someone began to doubt this knowledge.</p>

  <p>They had found clues related to the extraordinary creatures.</p>

  <p>It was not until Mike had met Lorena that he realized that there existed a greater Source World in the chaos.</p>

  <p>And the Source World was not the only world.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the chaos were a group of creatures that had been cursed by the Chaos Ancient God. They were called the Out-of-Land Fiends.</p>

  <p>Harold had heard his master mention this before, which was why it had been easy for him to connect to the strange encounter that Zheng had had in the sun.</p>

  <p>"How strong are these Out-of-Land Fiends?" Marsh asked, concerned.</p>

  <p>Since the Sword Clan had chosen to be on the side of justice and was ready to fight against the alliance of the rich and powerful clans on the Floating Islands, their situation would become more troublesome if other forces and powerful living beings became involved. This was the reason behind Marsh's concern.</p>

  <p>Harold shook his head. "I don't know. The master didn't reveal much."</p>

  <p>After all, everything that Mike knew about the lands outside the divine land, he knew from Lorena. But Lorena wasn't experienced when it came to the Source World, and neither had she seen the real Out-of-Land Fiends.</p>

  <p>She only knew that there was indeed a group of creatures at the bottom of the chaos that had been cursed by the Chaos Ancient God.</p>

  <p>However, if these creatures could release a band of red light that could wrap around the divine land, while allowing themselves to survive in the chaos, it only explained how powerful the Out-of-Land Fiends actually were.</p>

  <p>"You mean to tell me there is no way to solve this problem?" Marsh asked.</p>

  <p>Harold merely nodded.</p>

  <p>Marsh smiled bitterly at this. Gibson, who had been standing silently beside him, said bluntly, "I feel like you tricked us into getting involved."</p>

  <p>Harold smiled broadly at this and a moment later, continued, "I haven't tricked you. We've been on the same boat since the very beginning. And sooner or later, you will have to make a decision."</p>

  <p>His logic was simple.</p>

  <p>If they didn't help the Luo Clan, sooner or later, they would end up together. But if they worked together, there might be a chance of survival.</p>

  <p>The choice was inevitable for the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>Both Gibson and Marsh agreed with Harold on this.</p>

  <p>"We can put the Out-of-Land Fiends aside for now. At least, the divine land is no longer falling. Everything is still going on according to our original plan!" Harold said, attempting to lighten the mood.</p>

  <p>The fight between the Luo Clan and the Dongfang Clan had lasted for many years.</p>

  <p>By taking advantage of the crisis in the divine land, Harold had begun to pull other big clans like the Sword Clan and the Moon Clan over to his side.</p>

  <p>During this period, the alliance of the rich and powerful clans on the Floating Islands didn't take any revenge on the Sword Clan, nor did they have any big move.</p>

  <p>And Zheng had been in no hurry to look for his mother.</p>

  <p>It was urgent for him to absorb the Spiritual Darkness in order to reach a higher level of the True God Realm, but he still needed time to refine the Shadow Bearing Sword, which was why he chose to cultivate in seclusion.</p>

  <p>A secret training room was arranged for Zheng in the Heavenly Sword Divine City.</p>

  <p>Zheng sat up straight in the room. He reached out and a scroll appeared in his outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>A mind method about the Truth of Goodwill and Malice was recorded on this scroll.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still at a relatively elementary level when it came to using the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>For example, Zheng could only fuse the Truth of Cultivation Nature with his other methods.</p>

  <p>Of course, this was a different type of Truth of Godly Way and the Truth of Cultivation Nature seemed to be an auxiliary Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Yan's Truth of Holy Words was different. She seemed to be able to utilize the theurgy within this skill after cultivating it.</p>

  <p>Zheng slowly unfolded the scroll, revealing the large words that Harper had written.</p>

  <p>He read the words one by one, carefully.</p>

  <p>Just like when he had cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature, each word wasn't special in itself. But when he strung them together and read them, this text of the Truth of Godly Way seemed to exert a lot of pressure on Zheng.</p>

  <p>"A evil thought would lead to a fight. As evil thoughts accumulated... A good will can lead to the right path..."</p>

  <p>Everything went smoothly at first.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because Zheng had cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature that he managed to easily comprehend 3000 words in just six hours.</p>

  <p>"This is much faster than when I cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature!"</p>

  <p>A smile spread across his tired features. The cultivation of the Truth of Godly Way had consumed a great deal of his soul power.</p>

  <p>What he didn't know was that in the well located in the depths of the Sunrest Tree, Harper was silently watching him.</p>

  <p>The skin, flesh, and blood that he had condensed some time ago, had completely rotted again. He had once again become a skeleton.</p>

  <p>Harper could easily observe anything that happened under the branches and leaves of the Sunrest Tree. And Zheng was at the center of it all.</p>

  <p>"Talent... Such talent is outrageous! He has comprehended a third of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice in six hours! He would be a legendary genius even in the Source World!" Talking to Lorena had already revealed to him the extent of Zheng's talent. A warrior who had a Thousand Sanskrit Land was very obviously not ordinary. But he hadn't expected Zheng to be this talented.</p>

  <p>After all, it was difficult for even the powerful geniuses of the Source World to comprehend a text of the Truth of Godly Way in such a short time!</p>

  <p>After all, it wasn't easy, becoming a powerful master of the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>"I knew the Out-of-Land Fiends were targeting the divine land, but I wasn't expecting them to make a move at this time!" Once Zheng returned to the Sunrest Tree, Harper listened to Zheng's report.</p>

  <p>"But Lorena said that you were the hope. The fate of the entire Nine Li race rests on you. We are hoping that you could help us out of this predicament," Harper murmured.</p>

  <p>"What? You want to try the Shadow Bearing Sword now? Oh, no, no.</p>

  <p>Your understanding of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice is still at the lower level. How can you control that sword?" Harper's hollow eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>Zheng was tired after cultivating the Truth of Goodwill and Malice. And now, he was fiddling with the Shadow Bearing Sword!</p>

  <p>"I've tried this sword before. It's like an ordinary sword and has no life,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said, holding the heavy sword in one hand. "If I want to use this sword, I must rely on my comprehension of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice! I'll try again!"</p>

  <p>Zheng began to recite the Truth of Goodwill and Malice in his mind.</p>

  <p>When he activated the Truth of Godly Way, he felt the sword in his hand begin to quiver.</p>

  <p>"I was right!" Zheng was filled with joy as he continued to activate the Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>After he activated the Truth of Goodwill and Malice to a certain extent, he suddenly felt a vague consciousness emanating from the long sword.</p>

  <p>This consciousness seemed to wait for Zheng to make a choice, but because it was too vague for him to tell what it was, he could only make a random choice.</p>

  <p>But the moment Zheng made his choice, he felt like he was being suppressed by the sword and that his whole body was no longer in his control!</p>
