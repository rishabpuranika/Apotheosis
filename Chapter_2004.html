<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was known that while Supreme Lord Shadow was only a low-rank Supreme Lord, he wasn't as ordinary as one thought.</p>

  <p>Someone had once said that each Heavenly Destiny served a purpose, and there was no difference between top-rank and low-rank Heavenly Destinies. As long as one used their Heavenly Destiny wisely and to its maximum capability, then even a low-rank Supreme Lord could have a chance against a top-rank Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Heavenly Destiny wouldn't have much effect if not used appropriately.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow's Heavenly Destiny was called the Shadow Dance. His Heavenly Destiny enabled him to be invisible. However, Luo Zheng was able to see him because he had fused himself with the worlds' will.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Supreme Lord Shadow was left with no other option but to burn his blood essence to fight Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What he didn't know was that it was exactly the move that Luo Zheng hoped he would do the most!</p>

  <p>While Zheng's current strength might not be the strongest in this entire universe, it was difficult to find someone who could match him in close combat.</p>

  <p>If Supreme Lord Shadow fled, then Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to catch up to him. However, Supreme Lord Shadow had already decided to kill Luo Zheng, and now was Zheng's chance.</p>

  <p>A shadow suddenly flashed in front of Supreme Lord Shadow when he had just formed a small sword with his blood essence. He thought that Luo Zheng was like a man who wanted more food than he could finish. 'Does he really want to take me down? How ridiculous!' he thought. It was something he found intolerable. He laughed loudly and shouted, "Come at me!"</p>

  <p>The little sword in his hand shook violently and looked like it was about to fly at any moment. At the same time, a white light glowed under his feet as he was about to teleport away.</p>

  <p>A gust of wind blew as Luo Zheng, who was rapidly approaching, flicked his finger and a colorful ribbon of light shot out of it. A chain dangled at the end of the light beam.</p>

  <p>"Death Chain!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had seldom used it since he had gotten it.</p>

  <p>According to Saul's explanation, the Death Chain was like the light band of the fairy palace. Once two warriors were locked by the chain, it would be impossible for even a Supreme Lord to escape unless they killed the other party.</p>

  <p>Despite its powerful capabilities, Luo Zheng never had the chance to use it ever since he had ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng wasn't slow either. It was rare that an opponent of the same level could escape from him. However, the situation was different when Zheng's opponent was a Supreme Lord. Because as long as a Supreme Lord chose to run away, Zheng's current speed wouldn't allow him to catch up to them.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Death Chain could really be of great use right now.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The beam of light shot out from Zheng's hand like a bullet, headed straight towards Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>The speed of the light beam was far too fast for anyone or anything to comprehend. Back when Luo Zheng was hidden away in the fairy palace, the Supreme Lords were still quite far from him, but that didn't stop the light band of the fairy palace from reaching them. That was why they had gotten involved in the Desperate Melee.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow naturally didn't have time to react at that point.</p>

  <p>One end of the band had tightly bound itself to him while the other end was attached to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Death Chain had now bound the two of them together, and only one was destined to escape alive.</p>

  <p>There was clearly no way for Supreme Lord Shadow to use the Grand Teleportation to leave. Half of his body had already sunken into the white light. He thought that he could still escape, but Luo Zheng suddenly pulled him back.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Just then, the little sword Supreme Lord Shadow had released earlier also flew towards Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already anticipated the little sword. He fiercely swung his Great Weighty Sword and it drew a brown arc in the air, before it ruthlessly struck the little sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know anything about the little sword. While it was only a mass of blood essence, it possessed a deadly amount of strength. The Great Weighty Sword was undoubtedly powerful, but it had failed to shatter the little sword. Instead, the powerful energy from the collision sent the little sword flying up into the sky, hundreds of thousands of miles above the ground.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" Supreme Lord Shadow exclaimed. At that moment, panic began to build up in his chest.</p>

  <p>He found himself unable to break free from the light beam.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng's body was as tough as a monster. Supreme Lord Shadow couldn't help the chill that ran down his spine when he felt the endless power that emanated from Luo Zheng. If only Supreme Lord Shadow wasn't locked down, he wouldn't have to fear it. After all, Zheng's strength would be useless if the human youth couldn't touch him.</p>

  <p>Now wasn't the time for that because everything was different.</p>

  <p>Goosebumps prickled Supreme Lord Shadow's skin as realization dawned upon him. The situation seemed to be much worse than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Luo Zheng chuckled.</p>

  <p>He tilted his body slightly forward as he leapt ahead with the Great Weighty Sword in his hand. He raised his arms and swung the weapon down to chop off Supreme Lord Shadow's head!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The surrounding space was distorted and everything immediately felt a special kind of strange after Luo Zheng wielded the Great Weighty Sword.</p>

  <p>It was equivalent to a great world that had been condensed into a sword, and then descended away at a high speed. Who knew just how terrifying was the power inside it?</p>

  <p>That was precisely why Supreme Lord Shadow didn't dare retaliate to the sword strike. Instead, he left a black shadow that stayed put, while he himself flew towards the other side. The light band of the Death Chain did not wrap around the black shadow, but it was still locked onto Supreme Lord Shadow himself. So he still couldn't pull away from Luo Zheng and was even more unable to use his black shadow to confuse him.</p>

  <p>If anything, he had at least avoided Zheng's vertical slash.</p>

  <p>Yet how could Luo Zheng, who had Supreme Lord Shadow on a complete lockdown, allow his opponent to dodge so easily?</p>

  <p>When the sword missed its target, Luo Zheng had already guessed the path Supreme Lord Shadow would take. He turned his left hand into a fist and punched. It was useless for Supreme Lord Shadow to hide himself in the shadows because Luo Zheng could still easily capture him. What was more, he had a belt of light that dragged behind him!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>A sudden, muffled noise sounded in the air.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow felt as if his body was doing a somersault. His organs and even the sea of life vitality in his inner world began to surge up. It couldn't help that the countless lives in his inner world had been plunged into a catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Zheng's punch sent Supreme Lord Shadow flying in the air again, but both were still connected by the ribbon of light. This band of light would never break, even if it was stretched in mid-air.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng quickly pulled the light band down and yanked the nearby Supreme Lord Shadow.</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Although Supreme Lord Shadow had been dizzy from Zheng's punch and had been forcefully dragged back, he still mustered his strength to counterattack. If he took a few more punches, this would be the place where he would perish.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continued to pull Supreme Lord Shadow towards him, that little sword which had flown hundreds of thousands of miles up in the sky had now changed direction, and was now headed towards Luo Zheng once more.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The little sword let out an ear-piercing sound as it dashed through the air.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned; his Great Weighty Sword that was originally meant to cut Supreme Lord Shadow could only change its direction to block the little sword.</p>

  <p>A sigh escaped his lips. He had no choice but to deal with the little sword again. In turn, Supreme Lord Shadow, who was dragged back, took another of Zheng's punches.</p>

  <p>A person who had become a Supreme Lord would be linked with the heavens. Their body and soul would be greatly strengthened, which made them much more powerful than a world lord. However, Supreme Lord Shadow still couldn't withstand Zheng's punch, and his chest appeared to be clearly dented. His body spun like a top in the air as Luo Zheng effortlessly threw him around.</p>

  <p>Then again, to be punched by Zheng's fist was still better than being beheaded by his sword.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Luo Zheng pulled the light belt again and pulled back Supreme Lord Shadow, he repeated the same process.</p>

  <p>The scene was like a mirror when the little sword faced Zheng's Great Weighty Sword, while Zheng's fist faced Supreme Lord Shadow's body.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>After all the punches, Supreme Lord Shadow's elegant appearance had become more and more deformed.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that Supreme Lord Shadow hadn't thought of counterattacking.</p>

  <p>Although he was skilled in assassination and close combat, how could he be a match for Luo Zheng? Zheng's backhanded attack had crushed his counterattack, leaving the bones in one of his arms into dust.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow had resisted for a few more rounds, until he finally became nothing more than Zheng's punching bag, when the latter beat him up repeatedly with his terrifying and fatal strength.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had punched him about sixteen times, and the Death Chain still kept them bound. Although Supreme Lord Shadow was on his last breath, his life force was incredibly tenacious. Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh inwardly.</p>

  <p>Killing a Supreme Lord wasn't an easy thing.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Supreme Lord Shadow's little sword continued to clash against Zheng's Great Weighty Sword. In the end, it broke apart and the blood essence splattered everywhere.</p>

  <p>Now that the little sword had been eliminated, Zheng's eyes flashed as he flipped the Great Weighty Sword. He dragged Supreme Lord Shadow back to his side, and decided to finish him off with a single slash.</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Zheng suddenly heard a loud crackling sound, similar to the roar of a thunder.</p>

  <p>'A sneak attack!' he thought.</p>

  <p>Before he could even use the words' will to check what it was, he felt an oppressive and tyrannical power beat him from behind. His hand immediately pulled the deformed Supreme Lord Shadow and they smashed down onto the Inauguration Altar.</p>
