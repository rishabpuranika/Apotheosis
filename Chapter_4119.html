  <p>
</p>

  <p>Evil God always saw love as a ridiculous desire.</p>

  <p>The only thing he pursued passionately was strength.</p>

  <p>He would remove anything that attempted to keep him from this objective.</p>

  <p>Even when he realized he couldn't defeat Luo Zheng in Luo Zheng's inner world, Evil God refused to give up.</p>

  <p>Glory, wealth, and family didn't mean much to him compared to his ultimate goal.</p>

  <p>But now he couldn't contain his anger.</p>

  <p>It was until he felt hatred that he became aware of what he was doing.</p>

  <p>'Why would I get so angry?</p>

  <p>What a worthless emotion!' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He had also bid farewell to his past when he left Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Edna was aware of his thoughts yet continued to support him without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Although the Evil God was able to think rationally, anger still overwhelmed him.</p>

  <p>"I still care about her..." he said as he quickly figured out the reason he was mad.</p>

  <p>There was no one to blame but his wife.</p>

  <p>Edna was a liability for him, and he would never let her hold him back.</p>

  <p>'I can't let her live, ' the Evil God decided.</p>

  <p>It was the second time that he had tried to take Edna's life.</p>

  <p>He had stabbed Edna's chest with a sharp broken knife and planned to also kill himself afterward. But Luo Zheng came to their rescue.</p>

  <p>Evil God closed his eyes as he began to sense Edna's condition and emotions.</p>

  <p>He saw that Edna was worried about him and that she was relieved upon finding out that he was alive. Her temperature even rose that she slightly trembled with excitement.</p>

  <p>The guard of the dungeon was taken aback by how Edna reacted.</p>

  <p>"Are you saying the aura belongs to your husband?" the guard asked Edna.</p>

  <p>Judging by the powerful aura, he speculated that the visitor was at least a master at the Holy Soul Realm or Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>No matter what the mysterious man was up to, the guard was certain that he could not afford to mess with the man. Soon after, another thought occurred to him.</p>

  <p>The guard let out a snort. "If your husband was this strong, you wouldn't have ended up here. You are a terrible liar. Ha-ha!" he mocked before Edna could even answer his question.</p>

  <p>He reached out his hand, going towards Edna's neck.</p>

  <p>Despite how powerful he appeared to be, the Moon Shield City was the territory of the Bearing race. No one could risk stirring up trouble here.</p>

  <p>As he clenched the fabric of Edna's collar, strong hatred filled the dungeon.</p>

  <p>It was hot in the dungeon, yet Edna and the guard froze. They felt cold saturating the place as if it was an ice cellar.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the entire Source World felt a rising pressure as well, but it was much stronger in the dungeon of the Blood Sea Province.</p>

  <p>"Is he coming after me?" the guard murmured with eyes wide open in disbelief.</p>

  <p>He looked at Edna who was staring at a spot behind him.</p>

  <p>The guard turned around and saw a handful of dust slowly whirling on the ground.</p>

  <p>The dungeon of the Moon Shield City was forcefully dug out from the ground. Its walls, ground, and ceiling were made of earth. Dust would naturally fall from either the ceiling or the walls all year round.</p>

  <p>After the dust and soil twirled across the ground, they quickly gathered into a mass that formed a figure.</p>

  <p>It turned from the size of a fist into a humanoid shape.</p>

  <p>It looked exactly like the Evil God!</p>

  <p>"Darling..." Edna called out as she recognized the figure.</p>

  <p>"What nonsense are you talking about? It's a man made of soil. It's just a trick!" the guard said.</p>

  <p>He paced towards the man of soil and thrust his spear into its body, crushing it into pieces.</p>

  <p>But much to his surprise, the smashed man of soil instantly returned to its original form.</p>

  <p>Soil kept falling from the ceiling and walls, and in a blink of an eye, a dozen men of soil assembled.</p>

  <p>As a powerful cultivator of the Other Shore Realm, the guard had the strength of forty Jun. It was a piece of cake for him to handle these men of soil.</p>

  <p>He tried to smash the men of soil with the spear in his hand once again.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Edna was at ease. 'Evil God didn't come here in person.</p>

  <p>He used some secret skill, ' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>It was easy for the guard to deal with the men of soil in the beginning, but soon it became difficult as their bodies became harder each time they restored to their original state.</p>

  <p>He thrust his spear forcibly, boring a deep hole into the abdomen of the man of soil, but as he tried to draw his weapon from its body, he couldn't pull it out anymore.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! These men of soil.... they are..."</p>

  <p>The guard felt scared, even regretful that he chose to attack the men of soil.</p>

  <p>'I could have just run away. Why did I stay here to fight them?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>The men of soil ran towards the guard. They grabbed him by his hands, disabling him to move.</p>

  <p>The man of soil then pulled out the spear from its abdomen. The guard continued struggling to loosen their grip. He tried to squirm in an attempt to break free when the man of soil suddenly thrust the spear into him.</p>

  <p>The guard gasped as he felt the spear pierce through his elixir field. He was dying with every second. The men of soil threw him to the ground.</p>

  <p>Then one of them walked up to Edna.</p>

  <p>It looked exactly like the Evil God.</p>

  <p>With a smile on her face, Edna approached the man of soil. She opened her arms in a bid to hug it.</p>

  <p>But she stopped, shocked at the sight in front of her.</p>

  <p>The man with a splitting image of the Evil God pointed the spear at her.</p>

  <p>"I don't have time for weakness," it said while it tightened its grip.</p>

  <p>Edna's smiling face turned deadly pale.</p>

  <p>She knew the Evil God better than anyone else.</p>

  <p>In an instant, she already understood the Evil God's plan.</p>

  <p>"My dear, are you still going to kill me?" Edna asked. Tears cornered her eyes as she bit her lips.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the man of soil answered, emotionless.</p>

  <p>Without any complaint, she stood straight, closed her eyes, and waited for the man of soil to kill her next.</p>

  <p>Although the guard was dying, he remained in his right senses. He was dumbfounded as he witnessed the scene.</p>

  <p>'So those men of soil came here to kill and not save this woman?</p>

  <p>She and her husband must be out of their minds!' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>After a while, Edna felt the man of soil stroke her face with its hand.</p>

  <p>The man caressed her and said, "Wait for me here. I'll come to get you."</p>

  <p>It kissed Edna gently and stepped back.</p>

  <p>Seeing Edna submit to her fate calmly, the Evil God didn't have the heart to do it. He was taken over by guilt.</p>

  <p>He just couldn't cut ties with her.</p>

  <p>Under his manipulation, the men of soil destroyed and turned the dungeon into a mess. They killed the warden and guards to keep Edna alive for the time being.</p>

  <p>In order not to arouse the suspicion of the Bearing race, the Evil God created lots of men of soil in other places under their jurisdiction. He controlled them to cause chaos in those areas.</p>

  <p>After that, the Evil God said to the Shera and the former captain, "I am going to drop by the Blood Sea Province."</p>

  <p>"Blood Sea Province..." Shera repeated. She arched her eyebrows as she thought for a while. "No, you can't go there. That's the place of the Bearing race!" she disagreed strongly.</p>

  <p>Although the Bearing race and Divine Farmer race both suffered a great casualty in the battle of the Li Shan mountain, Othniel was still alive and the Bearing race had the Element Spirit Civilization to support them.</p>

  <p>It was highly risky to break into the territory of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"I'm not asking for permission," the Evil God said indifferently. "Did you forget who I am?"</p>

  <p>He was the owner of the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>The former captain and Shera were his subordinates and they took orders from him.</p>

  <p>Soon, the black ship turned around and sailed towards the ancestral land of the Bearing race.</p>
