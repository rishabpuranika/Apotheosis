<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had worked so hard at the very top of the Sacred Ailanthus but all he got were this iron ticket, these annoying skulls and their painful bites!</p>

  <p>He quickly swept his gaze and didn't see anything else that was special about the treetop anymore.</p>

  <p>He even activated his magical eyes and focused his gaze on the thirteen giant eyeballs.</p>

  <p>Zheng licked his lips. "I wonder what reward I might get if these eyeballs were shattered."</p>

  <p>Thinking quickly, Zheng jumped up and broke through the fog, flying towards those huge eyeballs in the sky.</p>

  <p>However, just as he got close, a huge invisible force stopped him and slapped him away from the sky!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The force was extremely shocking and also painful! Zheng didn't have a choice but to stop and fall from his ascent.</p>

  <p>His body recoiled and he quickly fell from the tree.</p>

  <p>His instinctual reaction was to immediately try to stop the momentum of his fall.</p>

  <p>However, he quickly realized that he was powerless against the formless energy that currently surrounded him so he simply resigned himself to his fate and let gravity do its thing.</p>

  <p>At the base of the Sacred Ailanthus, Amber, Aurora, and the rest of the team waited for Zheng to come down.</p>

  <p>A few of them had started theorizing why he still hadn't come down.</p>

  <p>"That guy... Could he have been sent back to the main city?" Aurora raised her head but couldn't really make anything out of the thick fog that covered the tree.</p>

  <p>If Zheng had been sent back to the main city, that meant he would have died up there.</p>

  <p>"It would be a pity if that was the case. He has so many Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>It'll just be left up there on top of the tree," Vivian remarked.</p>

  <p>Amber, however, shook her head. "I don't think he died."</p>

  <p>"But it has been so long...!"</p>

  <p>Just as Aurora finished her words, a shadow burst through the fog and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The force of the impact caused the entire ground to tremble for a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Noticing the hole that had formed on the ground, Amber quickly went towards the crash site.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!" she shouted, seeing Zheng climbing out of the hole. "Are you okay?" Zheng smiled at Amber's concern.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I'm fine."</p>

  <p>Aurora floated over like a butterfly but, just as she was about to speak, quickly noticed a dark mass on top of her head. She looked up and her jaw almost fell to the ground after seeing a number of small skulls floating above her.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just her, Amber and the rest of the Demon Night members were also taken aback by this surprise.</p>

  <p>"Be careful!" Amber yelled to everyone, exercising vigilance against these skulls.</p>

  <p>With sword in hand, she immediately channeled her power through the blade and released a bright ray of light towards these small skulls.</p>

  <p>"Clap, clap..." dozens of skulls were deflected by Amber's attack but it didn't prove to be very effective in completely vanquishing them. The skulls merely circled back and rushed towards Zheng, still trying to bite his back with their ghastly white teeth.</p>

  <p>Amber couldn't believe her eyes. "Wh-what?" The attack she released just now was extremely powerful but how come there wasn't even a dent in any of those skulls?</p>

  <p>"It's useless!!" Zheng yelled in despair. "These little skulls can't be destroyed!"</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?" Despite the chaos that was currently ensuing, Aurora had a visible smile on her face. She found Zheng's current situation interesting, and couldn't help but laugh at how funny he looked with all those skulls on his back. Frankly, he looked like a turtle.</p>

  <p>"This should be the curse of the sorcerer race," Zheng said, throwing out a small skull that had been gnawing on his shoulder. "Their curse is so powerful that these things are almost indestructible."</p>

  <p>The skull he had thrown merely circled back towards him. Zheng raised a finger in the air and waved an arc that then split and formed into numerous swords. The blades attacked the skull but couldn't even deal any sort of damage to it.</p>

  <p>Seeing that none of the attacks worked, Zheng waited for the skull to reach him. The others watched in bated breath as the young man suddenly reached out and grabbed the skull in his hand. He then lightly pressed his space ring and took out his pickaxe.</p>

  <p>"That's... That's the Black Star! It's a supreme divine weapon!"</p>

  <p>Aurora couldn't help but marvel in amazement.</p>

  <p>She was a successor of a world lord and had access to the best resources but not even she was allowed anywhere near a supreme divine weapon.</p>

  <p>The universe had too many world lords to count.</p>

  <p>But there were only around three thousand supreme divine weapons.</p>

  <p>These weapons had existed for countless years and it took around millions of years for a new one to be born.</p>

  <p>And here was Zheng with a supreme divine weapon of his own.</p>

  <p>To say Aurora was amazed was an understatement. To Zheng, however, whether his weapon was a supreme divine weapon or not was irrelevant.</p>

  <p>If it was powerful and useful then he'd keep it.</p>

  <p>Since this Black Star pickaxe could dig out all the Laws of Causality, Zheng wondered if it could also deal some damage to these small skulls.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>He brandished the pickaxe and struck the surface of the skull.</p>

  <p>However, nothing happened.</p>

  <p>Not even a supreme divine weapon could dent this stubborn, indestructible skull!</p>

  <p>That could only mean one thing.</p>

  <p>The Law of Causality in these skulls was much stronger than the one inside the Black Star pickaxe!</p>

  <p>How could this be?</p>

  <p>Whether it was the ancient sorcerer race or the Shadow Race, could they have been really that powerful?</p>

  <p>Those cloaked men from the Shadow Race weren't considered very strong and Zheng knew it wouldn't be that difficult for him to deal with them.</p>

  <p>But how were they able to summon such troublesome little skulls?</p>

  <p>If the Shadow Race were this powerful, why did they flee to the back of the world?</p>

  <p>There was no going about it. Since not even the Black Star pickaxe worked on these fiends then Zheng would just have to accept these skulls and their incessant biting.</p>

  <p>Aurora helped Zheng remove a couple of skulls from his back. As she did so, she couldn't help but take one and examine it closely. A small smile broke through her face. "I think I found a way to work this one out?"</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Aurora raised the skull. "These guys... They've been biting you the entire time, right?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Zheng nodded. "And I have no idea how long they'll keep following me like this."</p>

  <p>"Back in the main city, there are rules constructed by the law of the heavens. Fighting is forbidden there. Maybe we can give that power a try?" Aurora suggested.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes lit up at her suggestion.</p>

  <p>He suddenly wondered why he never thought of that before.</p>

  <p>As per the Illusion Battlefield's rules, fighting was strictly prohibited inside the main cities. This rule was inevitable since it was constructed by the heavens. He didn't think these skulls would be able to violate such absolute laws.</p>

  <p>With no option left, maybe Zheng should try entering a main city.</p>

  <p>He had previously set off from the Demon Night's main city and travelled twenty thousand miles north before arriving at the Deadwood Gate. Near here, there were two main cities, one to the north and one to the west.</p>

  <p>He'd honestly do anything right now just to get rid of these pesky skulls.</p>

  <p>"Other than these little skulls, what else did you get? Could it be a hundred fruits?" Aurora asked.</p>

  <p>She knew she'd never make it up there but she was still curious about what Zheng had acquired from the top.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened. A hundred fruits would be worth ten million points!</p>

  <p>He immediately took out his iron ticket but sighed in defeat, "No, not a single fruit. I didn't even get one measly point. All I got are this and the annoying skulls. Apparently, I need to lose five million Illusion Points!"</p>

  <p>Aurora gasped in amazement, "Five million?!" She herself had only managed to accumulate no more than 2 million Illusion Points and her rate hadn't been slow at all.</p>

  <p>What was so special with that iron ticket? Zheng had directly been asked to pay so many Illusion Points!</p>

  <p>To enter the Hall of Causality, one would have to pay five million Illusion Points. Just what kind of priceless reward awaited there to warrant such a high price? Not many people would know since not many people really had that amount of points to begin with.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng didn't really have the time to think about this with so many annoying skulls still on his back.</p>
