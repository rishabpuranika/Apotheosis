<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4173 A One-time Array </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were six extremely huge tombstones in the Ruin Graveyard, but two were missing to make room for the exit and entrance.</p>

  <p>Between the tombstones were several large spaces and behind them was a dull gray forest, known as the Rotten Tree Forest.</p>

  <p>The Rotten Tree Forest had been grim and lifeless for many years. The human race were not the only ones who did not like this place; even the native races of the Ruin Graveyard hated it.</p>

  <p>Tianming used the Grand Teleportation technique over and over again to rush towards the forest, several Holy Beings following closely behind.</p>

  <p>Although he had carried an Other Shore Token from the thirty-third floor, his achievements in space were not much better than those of the Holy Beings and so they were still able to catch up to him.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>In the sky above the Rotten Tree Forest, Tianming and the several Holy Beings stepped out of the space channel one after another.</p>

  <p>Tianming held the long sword tight and placed it horizontally in front of him. The figure of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord emerged once more.</p>

  <p>He looked down and said, "Clean up the rotten trees within a radius of ten miles, with the middle one as the center."</p>

  <p>The second he finished speaking, Joy smiled and said excitedly, "Let me do it!"</p>

  <p>She fell backwards and flew towards the Rotten Tree Forest.</p>

  <p>As she landed, a purple mist rose from a large area of the ground.</p>

  <p>It spread out quickly and formed a massive circle within the forest, enveloping a range of ten miles in radius, no more, no less.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The surging sword intent then soared into the sky and every rotten tree within the range was pierced through by a purple sword.</p>

  <p>They then soared into the sky and went straight to Joy, finally gathering in her body.</p>

  <p>The spreading purple mist then thinned out and all the rotten trees had disappeared. The center of forest had been turned into a circular plain.</p>

  <p>"That's quite a unique technique," remarked the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord as he looked at Joy.</p>

  <p>Joy smiled and had butterflies fluttering in her stomach. Being praised by the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower was a great compliment to her Grand Purple Aura Technique.</p>

  <p>The soul of the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord then jumped down and stood in the plain that had been created.</p>

  <p>He stamped his feet lightly and a golden light began expanding around him; a stone array appeared on the ground.</p>

  <p>"This array exists under the Rotten Tree Forest!" Bromley exclaimed, totally surprised.</p>

  <p>He had been in the Ruin Graveyard a long time but he never knew there was an array hidden here. He wasn't the only one; the native races did not know either.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was prepared for a day such as this," revealed the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>He then began controlling the array.</p>

  <p>When the array was activated, the entire Rotten Tree Forest shook, and the bitten tombstones began glowing.</p>

  <p>Once the array was fully activated, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord patted its center and roared, "Open!"</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>The Rotten Tree Forest shook more violently.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A huge dragon-shaped mark suddenly lit up within the forest. A light dragon then soared upwards into the sky and then towards the heads on the tombstones.</p>

  <p>Splash! Splash! Splash! Splash!</p>

  <p>Massive dragon-shaped marks appeared one after another, shooting the light dragons straight up.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later and tens of thousands of light dragons had rushed out.</p>

  <p>Tianming, Bromley, Mike, Holy Jay, and Joy were all stunned by this terrifying energy they were witnessing.</p>

  <p>A single light dragon wasn't a big deal; Tianming's sword strike could surpass it quite easily.</p>

  <p>But in just a few seconds, there were tens of thousands of light dragons, and their number continued increasing. By the end, there might be millions or even tens of millions of them. No matter how powerful the warriors were, they would find it difficult to stand up to such an overwhelming amount.</p>

  <p>"What happened to the Rotten Tree Forest?"</p>

  <p>"What a terrifying energy reaction!"</p>

  <p>"Is that the secret weapon of our Ruin Graveyard?"</p>

  <p>The creatures in other parts of the Ruin Graveyard were witnessing this too.</p>

  <p>The invasion of the heads had made the human race and other races desperate. They had never imagined the Ruin Graveyard held a secret weapon like this and it filled them all with great excitement.</p>

  <p>The light dragons seemed to have a mind of their own as they rushed towards the heads on the tombstones.</p>

  <p>All the heads, those at their original sizes and those a hundred or a thousand times larger, were devoured by the light dragons in a flash. Huge balls of light then burst out, one after the other.</p>

  <p>They shone like suns and erupted one at a time, sending a blinding light enveloping the entire Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>This lasted for five minutes.</p>

  <p>Finally, the light dimmed and the dragons and heads on the tombstones disappeared.</p>

  <p>"We made it!" Holy Jay yelled in happiness.</p>

  <p>"It turns out the Ruin Graveyard is really powerful!" Mike couldn't contain his elation.</p>

  <p>"Sir, how many times can this array be used?" Tianming asked enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>Bromley, Joy and the others were curious about this as well.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord slowly raised his hand and said, "Once.</p>

  <p>The energy in the array has now been used up."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>This rendered the Holy Beings silent and left them somewhat disheartened.</p>

  <p>"But with your great theurgy, you will eventually lead us through this calamity," said Tianming matter-of-factly.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was the owner of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>Mike, Bromley and the others hoped he could reopen the Mysterious Yellow Tower, but they didn't get the chance to ask their questions just yet.</p>

  <p>However, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord sighed and revealed, "The original plan was I would stand in the Ruin Graveyard and lead you through this disaster. However, things have changed."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Tianming asked.</p>

  <p>"Forget it."</p>

  <p>The change that the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord referred to was the fact that Zheng had successfully opened up his primitive land, which meant the Ruin Graveyard, which was used as a back-up, was no longer needed.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for Zheng's success, the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord would have bet everything on the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>But he did not want to tell them this; it would be a huge blow to their confidence.</p>

  <p>He considered for a moment and then said, "The change in the plan was caused by a sudden attack on the Mysterious Yellow Tower, which has now been completely destroyed. My four disciples and I have all died, but I had a premonition and placed wisps of our souls into the Lone Sword so that part of us is still alive."</p>

  <p>What! The Mysterious Yellow Tower was destroyed and the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was dead!</p>

  <p>Tianming and the Holy Beings were stunned.</p>

  <p>The powerhouse who had built the Ruin Graveyard and the Mysterious Yellow Tower had died. How terrifying was the opponent he had faced?</p>

  <p>"If that's the case, how do we fight against these heads?" Bromley said gravely.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had used the array to clean up all the heads here, but there were still more in the chaos.</p>

  <p>"You can't deal with them," answered the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>"Then all hope is lost," Mike murmured.</p>

  <p>The news that the Mysterious Yellow Tower had been destroyed devastated him. He had been looking forward to obtaining a better Other Shore Token. Now, however, he lost all hope. What was worse, from what the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had said, he couldn't even stay in the Ruin Graveyard.</p>

  <p>"No, there's still hope," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord said with a smile. "You are the hope."</p>
