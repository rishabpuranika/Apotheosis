<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The human heroes all looked at Dale with concern.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Dale replied with a nod. "He's still alive."</p>

  <p>The human heroes were stunned at this revelation. The Primeval Lord of Heaven let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>It was the answer he was hoping for. It was like a thorn was just pulled from him.</p>

  <p>This meant the human race in the seventy-seventh chaos did not really fall into decline!</p>

  <p>After all, the human heroes led by the Primeval Lord of Heaven survived to this day, and now, they had found that so had the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was also doing fine, although he was now on the opposing side.</p>

  <p>The survival of the three fellow disciples was nothing short of a miracle.</p>

  <p>"So where is he? Why did he disappear after entering the Jade Pure Realm?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven pressed.</p>

  <p>"It's a long story. After entering the Jade Pure Realm, we ran into some trouble..." Dale then launched into the story of what happened to their party a long time ago.</p>

  <p>"We had been hiding in the bubbles all this time to evade the Snake Spirit King. It was near-impossible to leave, but I took a huge risk to come here."</p>

  <p>"What was so urgent that you had to come here, then?" the Snake Goddess asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Dale's gaze swept through the human heroes. Apparently not finding who he was looking for, he turned his attention back to the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>"I'm here for Zheng."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess and the others all shot each other a knowing look.</p>

  <p>Dale didn't need to say anything more. They were sharp enough to know what he came here for.</p>

  <p>Zheng had displayed exceptional abilities since he had entered the Creation Myth Temple.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess also knew from having entered Zheng's inner world as energy souls that it was a primitive land. From there, Zheng had evolved more and more until he finally obtained the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>This growth was extraordinary and could not be attributed to mere luck.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the Snake Goddess were thus able to deduce that Zheng had an extremely powerful backer.</p>

  <p>But that only left them more confused.</p>

  <p>Even the Monkey Spirit King wouldn't be able to orchestrate such a feat.</p>

  <p>Who could possibly be so powerful that they could enable Zheng to fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline?</p>

  <p>It was beyond imagining!</p>

  <p>All this time, none of them could figure it out.</p>

  <p>"So it was my senior fellow disciple all along?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven mused aloud with a quizzical look.</p>

  <p>He respected the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord very much, but if he was the one behind Zheng, it would be somewhat of a blow to his ego. It would imply the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was far more advanced than him now.</p>

  <p>"That is correct. In fact, the Grand Weapon Refining Method that Zheng cultivated was given by my master," Dale answered.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Weapon Refining Method..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven muttered, with some bitterness in his voice. "His theurgies must be far beyond my reach now."</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess pursed her lips. She had always wondered where the Grand Weapon Refining Method had come from, but Zheng hadn't known either when she had asked him. She would never have thought it was related to the long-missing Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>"But my master is not as powerful as you think," said Dale with a smile.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Weapon Refining Method was not a theurgy he created. It was given by a human spirit."</p>

  <p>"Given?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven's white eyebrows shot up. "How about the ancestry-level bloodline?"</p>

  <p>"That's because of the Grand Weapon Refining Method," Dale answered.</p>

  <p>"Do you have any way to control it?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already mastered the Blood-controlling Method, but he hadn't been able to fully control the ancestry-level bloodline yet.</p>

  <p>"That's precisely why I'm here," Dale said. "Can you summon Zheng to the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded and took out the Descending Ring.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill had been floating in the chaos for a few days. It hadn't moved around too much.</p>

  <p>But to the hundreds of millions of creatures occupying the mountain, their world had been upended.</p>

  <p>They were still reeling from losing the support of the Source World, although the drifting chaotic energy was blocked by the enchanted barrier and most of them wouldn't have left Pear Hill anyway.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had ordered all the large cities in the west of the mountain to move to the east. The relocation was completed in just a few days.</p>

  <p>Streaks of purple energy now flowed around the stones on the west mountainside. When the energy touched the stones, they would turn into golden iron or silver steel, constantly changing shapes.</p>

  <p>It was the truth power of the Chaos Ancient God Judson.</p>

  <p>The Pear Hill had left in a hurry, driven only by the power of the three Chaos Ancient Gods. There had been no change to its speed since then.</p>

  <p>Judson's truth power could create and reshape materials at will. He was currently trying to turn Pear Hill into a giant ship so that it could travel in the vast chaos.</p>

  <p>Standing at the western mountainside, Zheng looked at the transformation and thought of the divine land.</p>

  <p>He had been in the Source World for so many years. He had no idea where the divine land was now.</p>

  <p>Once the ship was completed, Zheng had planned to request the Snake Goddess to have him pilot it in search of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Zheng was lost in these thoughts when the space around him suddenly started rippling. Fuxi promptly appeared in front of him. "The Primeval Lord of Heaven summons you to the Other Shore."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and sat down to recite the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, transporting him in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven," Zheng greeted as he arrived, bowing slightly and cupping his hands.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled warmly in response. "We have some good news. We have found the answer to your longstanding question of where the Grand Weapon Refining Method came from."</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows. At this moment, he spotted the stranger in a cyan robe not far away.</p>

  <p>Bromley had obtained the Grand Weapon Refining Method in the chaos, but even he had never been convinced it was entirely coincidental. After all, the probability of picking up a palm-sized golden page in that vast space was infinitesimally small.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Zheng asked the stranger.</p>

  <p>"My name is Dale," Dale said, bowing slightly and cupping his hands in reverence. "I came here under orders of my master to initiate you into cultivation."</p>

  <p>"Initiate?" Zheng repeated in confusion.</p>

  <p>He had been cultivating for many years, working so hard that he had finally reached the Eternal Realm. Wasn't he long past the initiation stage?</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others were likewise puzzled by Dale's statement.</p>

  <p>But Dale held firm. "Yes, initiate. May I enter your inner world to have a look?"</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at the Primeval Lord of Heaven. He nodded encouragingly.</p>

  <p>Zheng then created an avatar in his inner world, and also placed the souls of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess and Dale into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Zheng's inner world had developed quite well. Everything appeared to be running in an orderly manner, due in part to the efforts of the souls of the human heroes.</p>

  <p>But Dale took one look and let out a long sigh. "My master was right.</p>

  <p>This primitive land is just desolate."</p>
