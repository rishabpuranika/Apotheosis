<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When one heard the word heavens, it was often associated with grace, strength, and the ability to sustain a whole grand era.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the current round of heavens was quite stable. If something interrupted this stability, great consequences definitely awaited.</p>

  <p>Most of the time, it included the fall of a Supreme Lord and the reappearance of the Crown of Destiny.</p>

  <p>There were only 128 Supreme Lords in the whole universe, and all of them had extremely long lifespans. And while a Supreme Lord's death was a rare thing, it was also a great opportunity for all races.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were so few that even a large race like the Demon Night race only had four Supreme Lords. Thus, it was considered highly important to have another Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>Now, not all four of the Demon Night race's Supreme Lords supported Yao.</p>

  <p>Although Supreme Lord Gunter was one of her strong supporters, Supreme Lord Leroy had always stayed hidden and was always a steady supporter of Xun. As for the other two Supreme Lords, one of them stood by the Queen of Life, while the last one remained neutral but occasionally followed the Board of Elders' commands.</p>

  <p>If Yao could obtain another Crown of Destiny, the Demon Night race would have the fifth Supreme Lord who would give her his or her unwavering support. This way, her dominance would further be strengthened.</p>

  <p>"The heavens just trembled� Did a Supreme Lord die?" Yao asked, her eyes alight with a beautiful blue sparkle. Gunter shook his head respectfully in response.</p>

  <p>"No, my queen. All the Supreme Lords are still alive," he answered.</p>

  <p>"No? Are you sure?" Yao cocked one fine brow. She was surprised by his answer, so she asked, "Then what caused the heavens to shake?"</p>

  <p>Gunter's face held a trace of doubt. He hesitated for a moment, but continued, "Although no Supreme Lord has died, I can feel that there is an extra Heavenly Destiny!"</p>

  <p>"An extra Heavenly Destiny?" Yao repeated, apparently taken aback by his statement. "How is it possible? I've never heard of such a thing."</p>

  <p>A round of heavens only settled 128 Heavenly Destinies for the Supreme Lords to bear. This was common knowledge in the entire universe, and was also regarded as an unbreakable law. Thus, Yao was confused after she heard what Gunter had said.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why, either," Gunter said and shook his head. He had no idea what would happen if someone had forcibly carried the extra Heavenly Destiny, but the Crown of Destiny was something they had to fight for no matter what. "Anyway, I have already figured out the location of this Crown of Destiny," he added.</p>

  <p>"Where is it?" Yao asked eagerly. "It's in the Dark World," Gunter said.</p>

  <p>"However, it has been constantly changing its position since the day before yesterday. It seems that it has already flown into the deep space, headed towards the Northern Sky Region," he added.</p>

  <p>A hint of curiosity flashed in Yao's eyes. Then, she suddenly burst into a fit of laughter.</p>

  <p>"My queen?" Gunter asked with apprehension. He was sure that he didn't say anything funny, so he didn't know why she was laughing.</p>

  <p>"Xun was in the Dark World several days ago. I sent my people to chase her, and she is now in the deep space and heading towards the Northern Sky Region! This couldn't be coincidence, could it?" Yao grinned. "I didn't know about this!" Gunter exclaimed with surprise.</p>

  <p>He thought that it made sense, but he did not calculate Luo Zheng and Xun's positions anyway.</p>

  <p>Although the Supreme Lords carried the Heavenly Destinies, they still couldn't calculate everything. If they wanted to calculate any living being's position without using any relevant information, it was only possible if it was located in the same supreme world. Other than that, anyone beyond that distance was out of their calculation reach.</p>

  <p>Despite that, calculating the position of the Crown of Destiny wasn't difficult for them. In fact, whenever a Supreme Lord died and the Crown of Destiny reappeared somewhere in the 100, 000 supreme worlds right after, the other Supreme Lords calculated its position and sent their people to capture it.</p>

  <p>"It seems that the odds are in our favor! We must hurry up so we don't waste this chance," Yao said excitedly as she stood up from her throne.</p>

  <p>Her several feet-long azure skirt trailed along the steps as she quickly walked towards the palace entrance, with Gunter in tow.</p>

  <p>Everyone wanted the Crown of Destiny so badly. Gunter wasn't the only one who could figure out its location, as other Supreme Lords could do it as well.</p>

  <p>The Crown of Destiny was so coveted that every time it appeared, all the races fought fiercely over it.</p>

  <p>Some races had been lucky enough to see the Crown of Destiny appear right in their sacred place. If a warrior at the world lord's level had captured it, he or she would become the new Supreme Lord. However, it wasn't a really good thing for weak races.</p>

  <p>It was because the Supreme Lords who had just carried the Heavenly Destiny ended up quite weak. Furthermore, their strengths differed greatly from each other. For instance, a Supreme Lord born from a small race would often be killed by Supreme Lords from other races. After that, the Crown of Destiny would disappear, then reappear in another place in the universe.</p>

  <p>There had once been a time when the Crown of Destiny had appeared at extremely unlucky locations for seven consecutive times. It had appeared in the sacred places of some small races and as a result, seven new Supreme Lords were killed in succession. These seven unlucky Supreme Lords had died for the same Crown of Destiny. Many of the world lords saw this crown as a truly fatal temptation, the smiling Death.</p>

  <p>In the end, that Crown of Destiny ended up in the hands of a small race.</p>

  <p>That race's world lord knew that even if he carried the Heavenly Destiny, he would die quickly without the other Supreme Lords' protection. After some consideration, he had finally decided to give up the Crown of Destiny and let the other bigger races fight for it among themselves.</p>

  <p>The very first thing Gunter did after knowing the crown's location was to meet Yao. He wanted to inform her of the matter and hoped her to participate in the fight for the Crown of Destiny as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>It was a coincidence that Xun actually had the Crown of Destiny.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Yao had already sent people to kill her. And now, the Demon Night race had clearly seized the initiative this time!</p>

  <p>Click, click, click!</p>

  <p>As the silk of Yao's skirt glided towards the tiled hall of the Heavenly Punishment Palace's main entrance, the doors automatically opened.</p>

  <p>The group of old fellows from the Board of Elders had been waiting for quite a while now. When Yao arrived, all their eyes were trained on her.</p>

  <p>Among them was Enzo, who was surprised when he saw Yao had walked out of her palace. He whispered, "My queen�"</p>

  <p>"Yao!" an elder chimed in. "Are you going to listen to our words? You shouldn't ignore the Board of Elders!"</p>

  <p>"A fight between two queens is something against the ancestors' wills.</p>

  <p>No matter how great your hatred is, you just can't do it!"</p>

  <p>"If you set a precedent for this, the three queens of the Demon Night race will no longer remain as a whole, and I'm afraid that our race will no longer prosper!"</p>

  <p>Yao wasn't really respected among the elders. Although the queens were above everyone else, these old elders had a million years or even up to ten million years' worth of lifespan. They had seen many queens come and go. Moreover, the elders had the right to advise the queens.</p>

  <p>Yao waved her hand. Her eyes swept over the elders before she said in an aloof voice, "I don't have the time to listen to your nonsense."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense? You..."</p>

  <p>"How dare you call our advice as nonsense! Do you mean the Board of Elders is of no use to you?"</p>

  <p>A cold smile graced Yao's face as a faint, blue light flashed from within her body. Her perfectly sculpted face looked unabashedly hostile as she said, "Indeed, the Board of Elders is no longer of any use to me. If you don't mind, I will just abolish it."</p>

  <p>"Abolish?!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Yao's words were like a giant stone thrown into a very quiet lake, and caused a ripple of an uproar among the elders.</p>

  <p>The head of the Board of Elders was an old man who had lived for over eight million years. He jumped up and pointed accusingly at Yao's face as he scolded, "Back then, we shouldn't have helped you get to the top.</p>

  <p>How could you do this to us..."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Enzo frowned and decided to step forward and stand in front of Yao. Even if this old man was the head of the Board of Elders, offending the queen in such a way would still be regarded as an outrageous act. Still, it would be troublesome for them if he insisted on his seniority.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Yao remained stoic as ever. "Gunter," she said in her iciest tone.</p>

  <p>Behind her, Gunter quietly walked forward and looked the head of the Board of Elders in the eye.</p>

  <p>The old man froze for a moment and seemed to have thought of something. Suddenly, his eyes widened as he shouted in anger, "Gunter!</p>

  <p>How dare you! You can't!"</p>

  <p>Before Gunter had become a Supreme Lord, he had also been a member of the Board of Elders. When the Demon Night race had obtained a Crown of Destiny back then, they had decided to choose a member of Board of Elders to bear the Heavenly Destiny. It was the head who had recommended Gunter for the job.</p>

  <p>Never had he expected that millions of years later, he would actually die in Gunter's hands!</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>There were no demonstrations of power, no gruesome fights, and no flows of life vitality.</p>

  <p>The head of the Board of Elders, a Demon Night warrior and also a grand world lord, fell to the ground with a loud thud. All it took for death to claim him was a single glance from a Supreme Lord.</p>
