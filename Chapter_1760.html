<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After hearing what Tianming had to say, the Supreme Lords fell silent.</p>

  <p>They regarded the divine land as a world of fantasy. They knew that only by becoming True Gods would they be able to enter the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, what they did not know was that the universe they were in was actually the inner world of some Holy Being. And this Holy Being was already in a dying state.</p>

  <p>Even the True Gods could escape the Five Aging Processes and live forever. Then how could anyone be able to kill a Holy Being? There had to be a better explanation!</p>

  <p>Even though they were Supreme Lords, they took their time to digest this news.</p>

  <p>"Because of the current state of the Holy Being, there developed some flaws in the universe." Tianming paused for a moment before continuing, "I believe that everyone here has seen the techniques of Shania. She has broken through the highest level of the universe's rules and grasped the Law Power of the tenth layer, even though she is not a Supreme Lord."</p>

  <p>Many Supreme Lords silently acknowledged this fact.</p>

  <p>When Shania had fought with Luo Luo Zheng, she had definitely displayed the Law Power of the tenth layer.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were finding it difficult to understand how Shania was able to achieve this. How was it that she was able to grasp the Law Power of the tenth layer without even being a Supreme Lord?</p>

  <p>"The reason for this is that Shania found a flaw in this universe, which was also found by the people in another universe. They are trying to think of a way to pass through the Sighing Wall and enter our universe,"</p>

  <p>Tianming said.</p>

  <p>Now everyone was able to grasp the situation.</p>

  <p>But the Supreme Lords still had many questions. Who were the intruders? Were they also humans? Or perhaps they were from some other race. If there was a True God among the intruders, how would they be able to withstand it?</p>

  <p>"Since they have the help of a True God, how can we fight back?"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mathias sneered.</p>

  <p>"Humph, didn't the ogres always regard death as an honor? What happened now? Are you afraid of them?" another Supreme Lord mocked.</p>

  <p>"Easy for you to say that. How can we fight against a True God? Do you have any idea or technique?" Supreme Lord Mathias glared at the Supreme Lord and asked.</p>

  <p>While this war of words was taking place, others remained silent. They were at the brink of a war, and now there was an internal conflict.</p>

  <p>Although the universe was vast with countless geniuses and Supreme Lords, True Gods were still above every law of the universe. It was highly impossible for the Supreme Lords to fight against a True God.</p>

  <p>"Do not give up hope. We still have a chance!" Tianming looked around, trying to put on a brave face. He was puzzled with their reactions. All these Supreme Lords were the top warriors in the universe. Then how could they panic and not stay calm as him?</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin, Supreme Lord of Oracle, and Master Feng all looked at Tianming with admiration, appreciating his brave front.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin nodded his assent. "Yes, Tianming is right.</p>

  <p>We have a chance. We can find a way to fight against them."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he pointed at Luo Zheng's group.</p>

  <p>"They? Are we going to rely on these little fellows to fight against a True God? How is that even possible? With due respect, are you going crazy?</p>

  <p>No doubt these Godly Geniuses have potential, but anyone can see that the True God and Supreme Lords can crush them with one hand!" another Supreme Lord commented.</p>

  <p>However, Master Feng shook his head. "We still have time. They can still be trained, and even though the Holy Being is already on the verge of death, his inner world will still reject those foreign True Gods. The intruders won't be too strong to resist."</p>

  <p>"Yes, time is of essence," Supreme Lord of Oracle also chipped in.</p>

  <p>These nine people, together with Xenia, were the most talented Godly Geniuses in the entire universe. They were lucky individuals born into the universe when the heavens felt a sense of crisis. These geniuses were exceptionally powerful and their growth speed was much faster than that of any ordinary warriors.</p>

  <p>Some warriors would require millions of years to reach the level of a world lord, but not these ten. Others marveled at the speed in which these geniuses grasped everything in such a short span of time.</p>

  <p>Moreover, these ten people had completely surpassed the definition of the "divine-level talent," so this term that had once measured geniuses was of no use anymore. Their cultivation speed was 10, 000 times faster than an ordinary martial artist's; maybe even 100, 000 times faster.</p>

  <p>Actually, this was not only reflected on Luo Luo Zheng and the other nine Godly Geniuses, but on every other warrior in the universe. Relatively speaking, a divine-level talent in the past was no longer a genius because there were too many of them.</p>

  <p>The speed at which the universe was developing had increased a lot. As the Holy Being was dying, he had experienced a sense of crisis. So he accelerated the evolution of his inner world and released more of his resources.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the dozen Supreme Lords below still showed doubt and confusion, Master Feng continued, "Not only do we have time, we will also have the help of a True God."</p>

  <p>"We will have the help of a True God?"</p>

  <p>"Is it a True God from our universe?"</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>Master Feng smiled faintly at the rain of questions. "You are underestimating our Celestial Position race. Our race was created by a disciple of the Holy Being, and our mission is to protect the universe at all cost. We have some methods that are not suitable for you to learn right now. All I ask of you is to hold on to your patience and courage.</p>

  <p>Let's fight against our enemies together!"</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race was indeed a special race in the universe.</p>

  <p>Other races in the universe could not understand the reason for their creation. They did not even have any interest in expanding their race. On the contrary, they would often resort to weird activities among themselves.</p>

  <p>Master Feng's explanation sounded reasonable and practical.</p>

  <p>Just as he finished speaking, there was a sound of a loud crack, and a black fissure suddenly appeared above the cave.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The space was suddenly tearing apart!</p>

  <p>The space of the cave started to fluctuate. Everyone was dancing in the air and their bodies twisted.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a sharp claw covered with countless cracks emerged from the huge fissure and reached out to the people in the cave.</p>

  <p>The process of the space being torn apart and the claw stretching out happened in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"Move back!"</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng moved at a lightning speed and pulled Mu Ning away, just as the sharp claw swooshed past her feet. If he was a second slower, she would have been crushed under the sharp claw.</p>

  <p>"Flashing Step!"</p>

  <p>A light shone beneath Tianming's feet as he stepped onto it and disappeared from his original position.</p>

  <p>Pah!</p>

  <p>Xenia was quicker as she directly transformed herself into a bolt of lightning and struck the top of the cave. The top of the cave was scorched black and she hung like a bat, looking at the sharp claw with fear in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Nathan, Lawson, and Lucille managed to flee using their different techniques.</p>

  <p>Only Karl could not dodge in time.</p>

  <p>Karl was not someone who excelled in speed. He was an expert in absolute defense and destruction.</p>

  <p>However, his cultivation level was still low, and soon he came under the clutches of the sharp claw.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The golden light on his body shattered. That sharp claw probably belonged to an extremely powerful beast, and its strength was such that even a world lord wouldn't be able to match. With its flick, not only did the claw shatter Karl's protective golden light, it even crushed his body.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and the others could not believe the sight unfolding before them.</p>

  <p>They were rocked with fear to see their mate die such a horrible death.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they were caught in a dangerous atmosphere. It was such a heavy blow that they were finding hard to breathe.</p>

  <p>Didn't Master Feng say that there was still time? They wondered with fear. How did the enemy suddenly reach the base of the Celestial Position race in an instant?</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Soon after the claw squeezed Karl to death, it wasted no time and reached for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes darkened as all the energy in his body surged out, struggling to escape through space. However, the speed of the claw was incomparably fast. In the blink of an eye, the claw arrived in front of Luo Luo Zheng and was about to grab him.</p>

  <p>There were more than twenty Supreme Lords present.</p>

  <p>This entire turn of events left the Supreme Lords so speechless that they wasted precious time, just rooted to their place.</p>

  <p>"You evil-looking creature! Leave Luo Luo Zheng alone!"</p>

  <p>Saying this, Supreme Lord of Oracle took a step forward, raising her hand.</p>

  <p>She unleashed her long sword from its sheath, and a sharp light shot out.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The power of this sword light was very intense. A thin line appeared on the wrist of the claw, cutting off the entire claw in a neat line. It was a spectacular sight to watch.</p>

  <p>"The sorcerer race! The nerve to enter our world! You thought you could penetrate and get away so easily!" A hint of anger appeared on the face of Supreme Lord of Original Sin. He turned and fled to the back of the space.</p>

  <p>Master Feng let out a cold laugh. Fury was written all over his face.</p>

  <p>Although the importance of Karl wasn't as great as that of Xenia, he was still one of the Godly Geniuses in the end. He never expected that Karl would die such a horrible death. Master Feng turned his hands into two claws, grabbed at the crack, and pulled back the wrist that was struggling to retreat.</p>

  <p>The wrist whose claw had been cut off by Supreme Lord of Oracle was trying to pull out from the crevice.</p>

  <p>An invisible force roughly pulled back the broken wrist from the crack.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A huge, horrible-looking black creature smashed into the wide cave through the crack.</p>
