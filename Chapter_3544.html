<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3544 The Enraged Bugs </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>These Dark Nether Bugs were powerful.</p>

  <p>As trained insect catchers, the green-skinned men were very familiar with the habits of all kinds of insects in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Those Ghost-faced Centipedes and the Cold Earth Bugs might have looked ferocious and were highly toxic, but the insect catchers always had ways to deal with them.</p>

  <p>The Dark Nether Bugs were white and plump, and didn't seem to be harmful. But looks can be deceiving; their strength alone was enough to be ranked first among all the insects in the Dark Region!</p>

  <p>It was difficult for an insect catcher to capture even one Dark Nether Bug, but now, faced with four bugs, they were at a loss.</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned men stood upright in the grass, with miserable expressions. It seemed they had no intention of making a move.</p>

  <p>"Why not take action?" Zheng asked them through his chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>One of them faced Zheng piteously and said, "The three other Dark Nether Bugs are adults. They are incredibly powerful. If we tried to catch that larva, we'd be killed for sure."</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned men had painstakingly gone to great lengths to prepare for this hunt. And now that they had managed to attract a Dark Nether Bug, they could do nothing about it. Naturally, they were upset.</p>

  <p>While they were busy feeling sorry for themselves, Feng Ge suddenly cut in and said, "Just do what you need to do. I'll take care of the other three Dark Nether Bugs for you."</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned men couldn't believe their ears. This powerful being who, minutes prior, had almost killed them, was now going to help them!</p>

  <p>This woman was able to release dazzling light, which could penetrate the darkest corners of the Dark Region. If she could help them deal with the Dark Nether Bugs, they would be more than happy.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, frowned slightly. Ever since the Dark Nether Bugs appeared, Feng Ge had been acting strangely. Her eyes clearly showed a strong desire for the Dark Nether Bugs.</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng also had a strange appetite for them, but the appetite soon disappeared after he restrained himself. Now, it seemed Feng Ge couldn't control her appetite.</p>

  <p>"But I have one request." Feng Ge's eyes flashed hungrily. "The three Dark Nether Bugs will belong to me."</p>

  <p>"Of course, you can have them!" one of the green-skinned creatures hastily replied.</p>

  <p>Their goal was only to catch one Dark Nether Bug. Even though capturing more Dark Nether Bugs would benefit them greatly, it was beyond their capacity and they were satisfied with just one.</p>

  <p>Duh duh duh...</p>

  <p>The smaller Dark Nether Bug sped up and barged into the area illuminated by the candlelight.</p>

  <p>The candlelight usually eroded all the creatures in the Dark Region, but the moment its light hit the Dark Nether Bug, something unexpected happened.</p>

  <p>Under the pale yellow candlelight, some part of the skin of the Dark Nether Bug had been corroded, and at the same time, it began to shrink. The blood vessels in its transparent body began to glow with bright red light. It seemed to have absorbed a portion of the candlelight into its body!</p>

  <p>When the Dark Nether Bug got close to the candlelight, it stopped and let itself bathe in the light. The blood streaks in its body shone brightly.</p>

  <p>The other three Dark Nether Bugs followed suit. They stopped after they entered the area of the candlelight and enjoyed bathing in it.</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned creatures exchanged glances then nodded. One of them used his hand to put some medicinal powder with strong spicy aroma onto the rope. Suddenly, he threw the spicy-smelling rope towards the smallest Dark Nether Bug in the candlelight.</p>

  <p>His throw was surprisingly accurate; the loop instantly tightened around the head of the Dark Nether Bug.</p>

  <p>After realizing it was caught, the smallest Dark Nether Bug struggled desperately. Even though it was nothing but a larva, it was strong enough to make the two green-skinned men struggle to restrain it.</p>

  <p>But as the spicy medicinal powder on the loop took effect, the bug gradually stopped struggling. Its body grew numb and stiff, till it lay motionless on the ground.</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned creatures quickly reeled in the rope, dragging the bug through the grass.</p>

  <p>Woo...</p>

  <p>When the other three Dark Nether Bugs discovered that their littlest companion had been captured, the blood streaks in their bodies spread furiously. The original white, fat bugs turned to blood red in an instant.</p>

  <p>After the two green-skinned creatures put the Dark Nether Bug into a special bag, they cautioned Feng Ge, "Master, the three Dark Nether Bugs have already reached a furious state. Please be careful!"</p>

  <p>They were well aware how terrible it would be to feel the wrath of a furious Dark Nether Bug. As they spoke, they clutched the bag containing their prize tightly, ready to flee if need be.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng put his hand on the bag. "We can deal with the three Dark Nether Bugs, but you two can't leave now. Don't forget what you promised."</p>

  <p>Zheng still had to ask them about the black monkeys. How could he let them go now?</p>

  <p>The two green-skinned creatures sighed.</p>

  <p>If they stayed, they already knew the terrible outcome if the two humans were killed by the Dark Nether Bugs. Now that they finally caught the Dark Nether Bug, it was only natural they wanted to escape.</p>

  <p>But with Zheng's hand firmly clutching the bag, they found that they couldn't move at all!</p>

  <p>While Zheng was speaking, Feng Ge had already rushed out.</p>

  <p>It was more accurate to say that it was this physical body of the purified being that wanted to devour the bugs than Feng Ge's own desire to do so. The consciousness that this body naturally emitted affected her own judgment, which made her believe that such desire was generated from her own instinct.</p>

  <p>"Woosh, woosh, woosh..."</p>

  <p>The blood streaks that were flowing within the bodies of the Dark Nether Bugs trembled, then the bugs suddenly spurted out rays of blood radiance from their backs. Ten rays shot towards Feng Ge at lightning speed.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge hardly expected that the blood radiance would come at her so quickly. Gritting her teeth, she tumbled on the ground, having narrowly avoided that sudden strike of blood radiance. However, before she could recover, one ray of blood radiance shot through her left shoulder. The body of the purified being was pierced clean through, leaving a hole the size of a fist on her shoulder. For a moment, blood dripped from the hole.</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge!"</p>

  <p>Zheng cried anxiously.</p>

  <p>He had been under the impression that Feng Ge was powerful enough to deal with these bugs effortlessly. He never expected she'd get injured. No wonder the two green-skinned insect catchers were so afraid. It turned out that once these white and fat Dark Nether Bugs were enraged, they were extremely powerful beings in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was about to rush into the battle, Feng Ge held up her hand, indicating she was fine. Suddenly, she bent down and raised both her hands.</p>

  <p>White light beams shot out from her hands, forming two swords with blades hundreds of feet long. Clapping her hands together, the two swords of white light slashed at the three Dark Nether Bugs before her.</p>

  <p>With Feng Ge's strength, she could have easily destroyed these Dark Nether Bugs by simply using the Great Sanskrit Light.</p>

  <p>But she had concerns. On the one hand, she was determined to eat the Dark Nether Bugs. If the bugs melted and evaporated under the Great Sanskrit Light, she would have nothing to eat. On the other hand, the Great Sanskrit Light would spread far away in the Dark Region, which might alert other ferocious beasts.</p>

  <p>Phew! Phew!</p>

  <p>The white light swords were formless and they could extend or contract according to Feng Ge's will. The speed at which they slashed at the ground was astonishing.</p>

  <p>Before the three Dark Nether Bugs could react, their bodies were swept by the long white light swords. In the next moment, they lay on the ground lifeless.</p>

  <p>Upon a closer look, Zheng could see a thin crack on their bodies. They had been sliced in half so cleanly.</p>

  <p>When the two green-skinned creatures saw that Zheng wanted to rush up to help, they thought of seizing the opportunity to escape, but before they even had a chance to take one step forward, they witnessed Feng Ge easily killing the three adult Dark Nether Bugs.</p>

  <p>Both of their jaws dropped to the ground. Who was this woman?</p>
