  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Transcendent Divine Might was something that was known to be quite rare even in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Only Supreme Lords could create Transcendent Divine Might!</p>

  <p>The cultivation methods in the upper world were compiled by relying on the rules of the entire universe? There were so many factors involved that they could not have been quantized.</p>

  <p>For example, the visualization technique allowed the cultivators to obtain intents and insights through visualization of all the living things in the world. A creature could utilize his deep comprehension of the universe to create an entirely new cultivation method.</p>

  <p>However, most of these martial arts only involved very inferior laws. But the Transcendent Divine Might used the most superior law of all, which was the Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>Once the Law of Causality came into picture, extraordinary things began to happen. Its power could be understood from the fact that the Black Star pickaxe Luo Luo Zheng had contained a kind of Law of Causality that was unsuitable for combat, but was still powerful enough to be ranked among the top three thousand on the Universe Spirit Tablet?</p>

  <p>Treasures and weapons had to be carried with warriors. They were limited. However, a Transcendent Divine Might required the cultivator himself to grasp the Law of Causality. Thus, it made a great deal of difference to his chances and power.</p>

  <p>Since a living being had limitless intelligence on his hand, he could progress. The grasp of a Transcendent Divine Might was equivalent to a pass that would allow one to reach the highest and the mightiest rules of the universe. This way, the cultivator could then grow endlessly. Even the most powerful supreme divine weapon could not be changed once it was forged.</p>

  <p>The Sunset World lord had once grasped a Transcendent Divine Might by chance. This chance achievement had allowed him to take a huge leap and become a grand world. But he was the only one to do so. Even among the leaders and vice leaders of the thirteen palaces present here, Yolande was the only one who possessed a Transcendent Divine Might.</p>

  <p>Since she herself was a descendant of a Supreme Lord, she had once had a chance to cultivate a Transcendent Divine Might and caught onto it.</p>

  <p>It was also deemed extremely difficult to cultivate a Transcendent Divine Might. Each type of it was more difficult than the other and as unique as a fingerprint. The Soul Split Spell that Yolande cultivated had paved the way for her to cultivate the Transcendent Divine Might.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he had spent a lot of time cultivating the Stellar Body after coming to know about it. He would have progressed very far indeed but that was the future. Right now, he was still very young and had only reached the third level of the cultivation method so far. Moreover, the Stellar Body he possessed was an abridged version.</p>

  <p>Even so, when he had employed the Stellar Body technique and drew upon the power of the stars, it had left many leaders of the palaces stunned.</p>

  <p>"Ummm, guys! Supreme Lord Star spent his entire life comprehending the stars. As far as chronicles go, when he drew upon the power of the various stars in the sky, he managed to transform their light into swords and then crossed over ten thousand worlds to kill Supreme Lord Sherman, only to be killed by the curse that his enemy possessed. It was a life for a life and he perished instantly. That was truly a pity. What I don't understand is, Supreme Lord Star never had any descendant. So how come this guy inherited the Stellar Body?" a palace leader remarked lightly.</p>

  <p>The Sunset World lord looked up at the stars in the sky and then said in a mysterious tone, "Perhaps it is his own fortune that led him to it. This boy has many secrets. I can't see through them all. If he doesn't die, then there would definitely be a place for him in the supreme worlds?"</p>

  <p>Yolande did not participate in this discussion.</p>

  <p>Among all the people present, she was the only one who knew Luo Luo Zheng best and was also the most interested in him. After all, she had spent some time with him.</p>

  <p>"Don't judge the fate of men without destiny!" This was a common phrase used by those who had speculated about fate and such mysterious matters. However, since Luo Luo Zheng had dual fates, his future seemed to be even more complicated and mysterious. The universe was a big and vast and complicated place, but Luo Zheng's appearance had made it even more interesting.</p>

  <p>In the Illusion Space, streams of starlight superimposed themselves on Luo Zheng's body, and the power of the stars that had condensed through them was getting richer and more powerful by the minute.</p>

  <p>The Stellar Body was very different from other cultivation methods. As more and more stars were connected, the power of this cultivation method increased through multiplicative factors!</p>

  <p>Seeing the lights, Lincoln's expressions became even more cautious?</p>

  <p>Back during the Heavenly Fruit Assembly, he had once gotten into a conflict with the son of Supreme Lord Winfred. Being a common martial artist, he had humiliated Supreme Lord Winfred, who was two levels above him in cultivation! One could imagine how confident he was in his strength!</p>

  <p>However, he had never expected that he would be locked in battle with a boy who was an entire realm lower than him in cultivation.</p>

  <p>Now he understood that there were just too many freaks in this universe!</p>

  <p>He stopped thinking about the idea and the golden light once again enveloped his body, while the cyan stone on his forehead began to flash continuously with a faint cyan light!</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>The two warriors on the platform once again dashed towards each other and their weapons clashed together.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Layla's hands were tightly clenched into fists and her gaze was slightly dazed?</p>

  <p>His brother was extremely stubborn. All kinds of thoughts appeared in Layla's mind.</p>

  <p>'Brother, you can definitely beat Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Even if you lose, it doesn't matter. I will definitely find a way to save you from the Villain World?' she thought at first.</p>

  <p>But then, she was in two minds. On one hand, she was very confident in her brother and knew that he could beat anyone. On the other hand, she was afraid of Luo Zheng's unfathomable strength. Whether or not she would like to admit it, Luo Zheng's hidden strength was far more terrifying than she could ever imagine!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Due to the collision, a golden light suddenly dispersed around the arena and the power of the stars also unceasingly vibrated.</p>

  <p>Other than the dazzling light, Layla, could not see anything else since she was standing too far away and the light itself was also too bright?</p>

  <p>"Did he win?" Layla suddenly rose and stood on top of the lonely stone pillar, waiting for the light on the platform to dissipate!</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, a few muffled sounds rang out from the light, and a figure suddenly shot out from it.</p>

  <p>Layla's gaze froze and then a look of ecstatic happiness appeared on her face. She could see that the warrior who had just flown out was Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>His body shot out from the platform and fell down from the rolling clouds in the Illusion Space. This meant that Luo Luo Zheng had been wiped out from the competition!</p>

  <p>Lincoln was standing at the center of the platform. Cracks had appeared on his body. He fell into deep thought, his eyes under his perfectly-shaped eyebrows staring at nothingness.</p>

  <p>"Brother! You win!"</p>

  <p>All her previous worries had been dispelled at this moment! Her brother had won and was now free.</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had failed the final round of the Illusion Space, she had also won! And his own brother, after defeating Luo Luo Zheng, would gain his freedom!</p>

  <p>It was a double delight. At this moment, Layla was extremely excited!</p>

  <p>Hearing Layla's words, Lincoln smiled, but it was clearly a forced smile.</p>

  <p>To be able to obtain his freedom was indeed a joyous thing for him. He felt that his life was going to change after being reunited with his sister this time.</p>

  <p>One more pressing matter was that he had seen clearly what had happened just now. Luo Luo Zheng must have held back on his strength when their strikes met.</p>

  <p>He was sure of this fact because the power that Luo Luo Zheng had just released wasn't even half of what it had been before. Lincoln's keen observation skills told him that the limits of Luo Zheng's strength were far more than just this.</p>

  <p>'It is such a shame that I have to bear the pity of this little boy. I think I will still settle this debt with him sooner or later, ' Lincoln said in his heart.</p>

  <p>In the ancient hall, Luo Zheng's eyes slowly snapped open and a hint of helplessness could be seen on his face. Then he slowly walked out of the ancient hall.</p>

  <p>He wasn't a benign person by nature, but it didn't matter much to him whether or not he could pass this final round. After all, it was just a challenge and he would have far bigger opportunities to prove himself.</p>

  <p>When he had seen Layla's sad and melancholy face, he had suddenly felt that it resembled the expression on Yan's face a lot. He had been slightly moved at that moment?</p>

  <p>Outside the ancient hall, the old man in cotton clothes floating in the air also had a strange expression on his face. Not only him, the leaders of the thirteen palaces, including Yolande, and the Sunset World lord looked strange. They had also sensed what had happened just now.</p>

  <p>They all came to the same conclusion in their hearts that Luo Luo Zheng had lost this round deliberately!</p>

  <p>The only reason they could think of when pondering over why Luo Luo Zheng had deliberately given up was that he wanted to help Lincoln gain his freedom.</p>

  <p>Relatively speaking, Luo Luo Zheng and Layla were competitors. Besides, Layla had provoked Luo Luo Zheng time and time again?</p>

  <p>'I didn't expect this Luo Luo Zheng to be such a good fellow," one of the leaders remarked, shaking his head. "You know, in this world of martial arts which always follows the rule of natural selection, kindness isn't a merit."</p>

  <p>However, the Sunset World lord chuckled and replied, "To the weak warriors, perhaps kindness is a fatal weakness, but to the absolute strong ones, kindness is a mercy that should not be taken lightly?"</p>

  <p>Every race and every creature in the universe was almost always in a constant state of danger, since the universe was filled with uncertainty and turmoil, making this a world where the strong preyed on the weak. If a person's strength was insufficient, then being kind would only bring him bad luck and fate. No good would fall to such a person as his kindness would be taken advantage by people with ill intentions. But when this person's strength was strong enough, then even if he compromised or gave way, it didn't matter to him, because his foundation was extremely strong and no one could shake it. The worst that could happen to him was a temporary defeat of his own will.</p>

  <p>Though Luo Luo Zheng had yet to reach that level, in the eyes of the Sunset World lord, he was going to reach it pretty sooner than people thought.</p>
