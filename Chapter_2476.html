<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2476 Shadow Of Snake Goddess </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The purple shadow rapidly extended after fully enveloping Yan.</p>

  <p>Now restrained, Yan put her hands over her chest and recited something softly.</p>

  <p>The shadow continued expanding.</p>

  <p>A hundred feet, a thousand feet, ten thousand feet?</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the shadow turned into a colossal creature.</p>

  <p>While it had the slender figure of a woman, the ends of its arms had no hands but instead, two slender whips.</p>

  <p>Its head was akin to an eagle's with a sharp, beak-like mouth.</p>

  <p>And Yan was completely embedded right in the middle of it all.</p>

  <p>"What...what is this?"</p>

  <p>Enoch was completely dumbfounded at the sight of the huge monster.</p>

  <p>Never had he heard of such a thing in the divine land.</p>

  <p>After Yan entered the Everest Spirit Mountain, Harold had told her that there was a powerful monster hidden in her heart.</p>

  <p>He said that it would make her slowly lose her mind, devour her own soul, and eventually, completely replace her.</p>

  <p>Until now, Yan had no clue what he was talking about.</p>

  <p>As she heard of it, she never realized what its existence meant.</p>

  <p>Harold said that it was a sort of talent and ability of her race.</p>

  <p>Everyone from this race had to face the monster within from the moment they were born.</p>

  <p>If one could control the monster, they would have far more powerful abilities than the other race members. If not, then one would simply die young.</p>

  <p>When Yan was in the Lower World, she had never discovered the monster herself.</p>

  <p>She hardly even believed what Harold told her.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until Harold woke up the monster in Yan's heart that she discovered its existence and understood her own uniqueness.</p>

  <p>She wasn't primarily concerned for herself, but for her brother.</p>

  <p>Harold revealed to her that while they shared the same parents, they belonged to two different races.</p>

  <p>As a result, Luo Zheng didn't carry such a monster in his heart.</p>

  <p>Under Harold's guidance, Yan continued fighting off the monster.</p>

  <p>There was a time when she had been in an unfavorable situation, and it was with Harold's help that she managed to survive it.</p>

  <p>But while Yan currently had the upper hand, she still found it difficult to control the monster. If she released the monster in her heart rashly, it was likely to make a sudden counterattack.</p>

  <p>But seeing her brother stuck in a crisis, Yan lost all sense of reason.</p>

  <p>She released the monster in her heart without a hint of hesitation.</p>

  <p>"No!" Harold yelled.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Witnessing the scene, Harold punched the beam at the side of the building in frustration, making the entire structure tremble.</p>

  <p>"Is the shadow she's wrapped in the legendary shadow of Snake Goddess?"</p>

  <p>"Wow, it's the first time I've ever seen it. How special!"</p>

  <p>Marsh and Gibson were filled with astonishment.</p>

  <p>The people of the divine land had little knowledge about the chaos.</p>

  <p>Only by the Sanskrit words did they find out about the extraordinary creatures.</p>

  <p>But the information they got from Sanskrit words just wasn't quite as comprehensive as other resources.</p>

  <p>The two Holy Beings had heard about Mike's son and daughter in the past.</p>

  <p>"Yes. She's not qualified to control the shadow of Snake Goddess now.</p>

  <p>She's digging her own grave by releasing the shadow. If her soul is devoured, the consequences will be unimaginable." Harold was both worried and helpless about the situation.</p>

  <p>Originally, it was a great surprise to find out that Luo Zheng had surpassed Duke and registered his name on the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>Having done this, Luo Zheng was sure to obtain the inheritance of the skeleton.</p>

  <p>But an unexpected fiend arrived and blocked his path.</p>

  <p>As soon as they saw Duke's crazy behaviors, Harold, Marsh, and Gibson immediately understood what the Dongfang Clan was planning.</p>

  <p>Marsh felt truly regretful.</p>

  <p>If only they had known earlier, they could've made sure not to give the alliance of the wealthy clans a place in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>For the moment, the Sword Clan had not completely broken up with the alliance of wealthy clans. It was inappropriate to shut them out directly, so he only reduced their places to half.</p>

  <p>Never did it occur to them that the Dongfang Clan had been planning something in the background? they had the audacity to release a fiend into the debate venue.</p>

  <p>Everyone's hope turned to dust when the enemy appeared.</p>

  <p>"Facing this opponent, she would die even without risking the shadow.</p>

  <p>She did the right thing," said Marsh.</p>

  <p>It was better to play all your cards than idle away and escape, after all.</p>

  <p>Even the lowly cricket and ant could cling to life, let alone human beings or True Gods.</p>

  <p>The so-called True Gods, consummate True Gods, Demi-holy Beings, and Holy Beings could acquire eternal lifetimes, but this did not mean that they were all-powerful.</p>

  <p>Just like ordinary mortals, they followed the law of the jungle, and they possessed endless desires and fought for justice or profit.</p>

  <p>Wrapped in the purple shadow, Yan was completely engulfed by the purple light. She whipped her eyes around and waved her hands.</p>

  <p>The huge shadow did the same thing and waved its enormous arms.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>But unlike Yan's own arms, those of the shadow acted as two sharp whips.</p>

  <p>They were brandished and whipped into the air, creating a large black crack.</p>

  <p>Even the space in the divine land couldn't stand the two whips. One could only imagine just how terrifying the attack was.</p>

  <p>But Edmond, of course, didn't take any True God seriously.</p>

  <p>After all, he didn't even bother to slaughter such a top-rank True God in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Once upon an age, an Abyss Demon used the Portal of Summoning to get Edmond onto the first stage of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Such was an important trial organized by the alliance of wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>The Abyss Demon Region was indeed terrifying, but the monsters on the first stage weren't supposed to be too strong. It was a useful venue for the disciples from the wealthy clans to temper themselves and accumulate some divine might coins.</p>

  <p>So after preparing them, many wealthy clans would send their disciples into the Abyss Demon Region every once in a while.</p>

  <p>But never did they expect to encounter Edmond on the very first stage.</p>

  <p>For the disciples of the alliance of the wealthy clans, Edmond's arrival was a complete nightmare.</p>

  <p>In less than half a minute, he had killed over 500 True Gods, including 76 top-rank True Gods and 470 mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Because of Edmond's appearance, the wealthy clans were more cautious about training in the Abyss Demon Region. The large-scale training must absolutely be accompanied by consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>In Edmond's eyes, these True Gods were simply too weak to even bother killing.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was his first encounter in this place. A special aura filled Luo Zheng's bodily movement skill. Edmond couldn't catch him and had to use his full strength just to tie Luo Zheng up.</p>

  <p>When he sighed at the strange man, a top-rank True God suddenly formed a strange shadow.</p>

  <p>Its power was far stronger than Edmond had expected.</p>

  <p>"Have the young fellows from the divine land become so powerful?"</p>

  <p>When the two whips came right at him, Edmond was left with no choice but to stretch out his hands and clasp them together, preparing to grip the whips in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Upon witnessing the scene, Yan snorted.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>When Edmond grabbed the two whips, his face changed immediately.</p>

  <p>A powerful, tearing force was transmitted. His hands became as fragile as pieces of paper, instantly reduced to brittle pieces of blood.</p>
