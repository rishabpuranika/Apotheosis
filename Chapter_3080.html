  <p>In the Dragon City</p>

  <p>On this day, many stood before the red stone used for testing. Last night, more than ten warriors from outside the Dragon City had reached the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>After they had merged with their Other Shore Tokens for the first time, everyone was on edge, desperate to put their strength to the test.</p>

  <p>A woman with long hair approached the red stone. The crowd grew still, watching in anticipation.</p>

  <p>A small seed then appeared on her head.</p>

  <p>"It's the Spiritual Fire Seed..."</p>

  <p>"She is so lucky to have gotten the Spiritual Fire Seed! It's so difficult to dig and find one."</p>

  <p>"It's highly likely that someone helped her to get it."</p>

  <p>Everyone gathered around had a comment to make and all were green with envy of the long haired woman.</p>

  <p>The woman held a short cyan sword in her hand.</p>

  <p>As she raised the short sword, the Spiritual Fire Seed began to glow. Just then, a flame ignited on her short sword.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>The woman charged at the red stone with vigor and her short sword slashed out ahead of her.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>She struck the red stone with her sword, using all her strength, which was absorbed by the stone.</p>

  <p>Soon after the blow, the red stone flashed and a strange pattern began forming in the middle. The pattern was the word 'three'.</p>

  <p>The result had been revealed to an impressed and cheering crowd.</p>

  <p>"That's what I expected..."</p>

  <p>"The force of the Spiritual Fire Seed is less than three Jun. But combined with the woman's cultivation base, it is almost at that level."</p>

  <p>"It's a good start for a warrior who has only just reached the Other Shore Realm." The crowd continued with their judgment from the sidelines.</p>

  <p>The woman was clearly satisfied with her result. She put away her short sword, took a step back, and stood in front of a tall man.</p>

  <p>The large flag he carried showed him to quite clearly be a Flag Master.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was not interested in her result, as he had seen what he needed to.</p>

  <p>This woman had just reached the Other Shore Realm. It was obvious that she was not a Flag Master, yet she was able to enter and leave Dragon City freely.</p>

  <p>It seemed the requirements for free entry and exit of the Dragon City were not as tough as he had imagined.</p>

  <p>He did not know how Gant went in and out without a flag. He thought he should ask him.</p>

  <p>Once the woman had gone, another man walked up to the stone, ready for his turn.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Token the man had fused with was the most common one, the Heavenly Cyan Stone. It could be found on the beach of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Of course, the man's result was not all that impressive.</p>

  <p>Although he threw all he had into his attack on the red stone, only 'one' appeared on it. This meant his force was less than two Jun.</p>

  <p>The man still walked away, very satisfied. After all, he had finally set foot on the Other Shore. Fusing with the Heavenly Cyan Stone was just the first step, and next time he could obtain a better, more powerful Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>The next few warriors who stepped up possessed ordinary Other Shore Tokens, including the Heavenly Cyan Stone, the Angelica Dahurica, and so on. Most of their forces were revealed to be one or two Jun, hardly an impressive feat.</p>

  <p>Then came a handsome man with a very special Other Shore Token, a shiny crystal.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heard murmurs around him that this was the Magic Cloud Crystal. This man relied heavily on this Magic Cloud Crystal to erupt a formidable force of four Jun.</p>

  <p>He was from a large clan in the Bloom Divine Province, and his clan was as powerful as Gant's. He appeared to have a close connection with the Taiyi Heaven Palace as many Flag Masters walked up to congratulate him.</p>

  <p>After almost all had taken their turns at the red stone, Luo Zheng decided it was time for him to give it a try.</p>

  <p>He didn't really want to show his talent here but there was only one red stone for the test in the Dragon City and so he had no choice.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng appeared, all eyes were focused on him.</p>

  <p>"He is the guy who is against Galen."</p>

  <p>"Hush! He has a strong background. Even though he has offended Galen, Galen hasn't dared to say anything back."</p>

  <p>"I don't think Galen will tolerate being bullied like that!"</p>

  <p>"He moved quite fast in crossing the sea to reach the Other Shore..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked towards the red stone slowly and focused. With a flick of his finger, the Snow Sword was in his hand, before anyone even knew what happened.</p>

  <p>When the Flag Masters who were familiar with the Snow Sword saw it, their eyes widened in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"It's the Snow Sword from the Best Swords Shop..."</p>

  <p>"He's bought the sword.</p>

  <p>How rich he is!"</p>

  <p>Many Flag Masters wished they could own the swords from the Best Swords Shop, but those Profound Blood Treasures were extremely expensive. Chief among them was the Snow Sword, a premium Profound Blood Treasure. The Flag Masters could not afford this, and only the Alliance Chiefs could.</p>

  <p>A buzz rang out as the crowd stared at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng summoned his strength, an icy light flashed from his blade.</p>

  <p>He had bought the sword not long ago, but he had already used it in the Sword Tower many times, and developed a great skill in handling it. This was a high quality sword with almost no weakness. It was sure to produce something amazing at the hands of a skilled master.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then began to try to make use of the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>He didn't hold the Other Shore Token to his head like the others. When the demonic eye flashed a red light, Luo Zheng deliberately closed his right eye, completely covering the red light.</p>

  <p>He began pulling out the strength within the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>A surge of power flowed around his body. This power was not as pure as that of the Nine Divine Stars in his inner world, as the stars' power belonged entirely to him.</p>

  <p>Although the Other Shore Token to some extent belonged to him as well, it had come from elsewhere and was only being used by Luo Zheng for the time being.</p>

  <p>"The momentum is so powerful!"</p>

  <p>"Has he really only just reached the Other Shore Realm?"</p>

  <p>"I would say his soul momentum alone is comparable to that of the warriors in the second or third stage of the Other Shore Realm!"</p>

  <p>On feeling the aura that erupted from Luo Zheng, the crowd looked on expectantly.</p>

  <p>Some were confused; Luo Zheng seemed unwilling to reveal his Other Shore Token. What was he hiding?</p>

  <p>While they were all left stunned and guessing, Luo Zheng had already lifted and swung the Snow Sword at the red stone, so fast that anyone had no time to see.</p>

  <p>Boom! He struck the stone with a thunderous bang.</p>

  <p>A trace of red light was left on the blade of the Snow Sword, being the evidence of the speed and power of the swing.</p>

  <p>When the red light had flashed, all those gathered around felt their minds shaken and they were even forced into taking a step back.</p>

  <p>"Well... I didn't control that too well..." Luo Zheng mumbled to himself.</p>

  <p>He'd been very careful when he made use of the power of the Other Shore Token. However, he made a mistake when he used it for the first time. The red light was still released from the demonic eye.</p>

  <p>Everyone was blown away, standing still with their eyes glazing over in bewilderment when the red stone slowly revealed one large word.</p>

  <p>'Nineteen'.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng remained calm upon having his result revealed.</p>

  <p>He hadn't even used his own strength or released the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had used the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship as well as the Three Annihilation Strike, or even the Six Annihilation Strike, the result could have been much, much higher.</p>

  <p>But this time, he just wanted to test the power of the demonic eye and nothing else.</p>

  <p>Even then, he hadn't used up all the strength of the demonic eye. He'd only used half and this was enough to leave everyone looking at the result in front of them in disbelief. They could not comprehend and accept it. How had someone pulled this off?</p>

  <p>Whether they could accept it or not, the result still remained on the red stone. It was the unmistakable proof of what just happened.</p>

  <p>"Nineteen Jun!"</p>

  <p>"It's remarkable enough to be comparable to the Other Shore Token of Stage Three!"</p>

  <p>"What on earth is his Other Shore Token?" The crowd's incredulity could not cease.</p>
