<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng began to exert more effort to drag the skull into the city, his feet clinging onto a piece of brick on the city wall.</p>

  <p>The power within his body, which was enough to topple the mountains and overturn the seas, surged out violently.</p>

  <p>If he had been standing on top of a wall made of ordinary bricks and stone, the wall would have collapsed like tofu.</p>

  <p>But this main city of the Illusion Battlefield was indestructible, and even with this level of power unleashed, the city wall beneath his feet didn't budge at all.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the target that had to withstand Luo Zheng's power was the small skull outside the city. The rule that fighting was forbidden in the city was void in this situation.</p>

  <p>However, that invisible force turned out to be like an insurmountable wall! Even after Luo Luo Zheng had activated all the dragon scales, he was still unable to drag the small skull into the main city.</p>

  <p>The skull kept grinding its teeth on his hand and even bit Luo Zheng's fingers.</p>

  <p>Feeling a sharp sting on his hand, Luo Luo Zheng had no choice but to let go of the skull.</p>

  <p>It would be impossible to destroy these small skulls by taking advantage of the power of the city's rules.</p>

  <p>This main city was indestructible. Even if Luo Luo Zheng unleashed his full strength, he wouldn't be able to destroy its walls, because there was an invisible power of rules protecting the place.</p>

  <p>And for that same reason, it was impossible for Luo Luo Zheng to pull this little skull into the main city!</p>

  <p>This group of small skulls was a curse that had been cast by the sorcerer race. Once these skulls had been summoned, they would continuously launch attacks at their target. This was also why the main city kept them outside.</p>

  <p>Only if Luo Luo Zheng had the power to destroy the main city would he be able to bring the small skulls inside. However, if Luo Zheng's power was that strong, he wouldn't need to rely on the city's power of rules to kill the small skulls in the first place. He could directly crush them!</p>

  <p>Looking at the skulls that were constantly moving around in the air, Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and walked a few steps along the wall of the main city.</p>

  <p>The skulls also moved along the wall of the main city, following him like a shadow.</p>

  <p>"These damned things?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was speechless as he stared at the small skulls with horrible white teeth.</p>

  <p>Many ogre martial artists stared at Luo Luo Zheng as he paced back and forth, each one of them becoming more and more confused. They had no idea what he was trying to do.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had walked a few steps on the top of the city wall, he frowned as he looked at the small skulls. Suddenly, he jumped out of the city and grabbed another small skull. Immense power surged out from his arm as he grabbed it and threw it at the main city.</p>

  <p>This small skull flew toward the main city like a meteor with extreme force.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>When the skull reached the main city, it collided against an invisible wall and bounced back at an extremely fast speed, hurtling toward the ground outside the city and directly penetrating the earth.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>No one knew how far the small skull had traveled under the ground.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the rebound force that had kept the small skull moving disappeared. Soon, the small skull emerged from the ground far away from Luo Luo Zheng before quickly returning to him and biting into his back.</p>

  <p>"Huh! I get it, that human kid seems to want to get rid of those skulls behind him!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder where he attracted all these things. They are so sturdy.</p>

  <p>They are probably even stronger than divine weapons, right?"</p>

  <p>Although these ogre martial artists were talking in low voices, Luo Luo Zheng still heard them.</p>

  <p>He had already been very depressed, and now, after hearing these words, a trace of killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p>

  <p>'Since I can't get rid of these damned things, I'll just kill and gather the Illusion Points first!' he decided.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's Mu Ning changed, the expressions of all the ogre warriors inside and outside the city walls suddenly darkened!</p>

  <p>In particular, the ogre martial artists outside the main city were very afraid.</p>

  <p>One of the ogre martial artists immediately reacted to the situation.</p>

  <p>Realizing that the state of affairs wasn't looking good, he fled toward the main city at an extremely fast speed without another thought.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was extremely powerful, but as long as they fled into the main city, they would be safe!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng did not give them any chance to survive?</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>A small skull whizzed through the air, carrying a massive force as it smashed into the head of the ogre martial artist who had been running to the main city.</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artist had been wearing a helmet on his head, but the small skull had shattered it like it was nothing and split open the martial artist's head like it was a fragile watermelon.</p>

  <p>A light ball of Illusion Points spread out and shot toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't even bother to calculate the number of Illusion Points he had gained. He simply pulled the small skulls behind him and shot them toward the rest of the ogre martial artists around him.</p>

  <p>Boom, bang, bong!</p>

  <p>Various sounds of collisions rang out. Luo Luo Zheng had no other choice. These small skulls were terrifyingly tough. Combined with his frightening strength, they could become powerful weapons.</p>

  <p>However, he would rather that they had never appeared.</p>

  <p>In a few seconds, Luo Luo Zheng had killed eight ogre martial artists.</p>

  <p>Of course, there had been a lot more ogre martial artists in the vicinity to begin with. Most of them had fled back to the main city, while another few had fled into the wilderness, not daring to return to the city.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't bother to chase after any of them. He circled around the main city, clutching one of the small skulls tightly in his hand.</p>

  <p>Whenever he encountered any ogre martial artists outside the city, he would throw the small skull at them, killing them one by one.</p>

  <p>More effort was required to kill ogre marital artists with powerful strength, but the weaker ones could be killed with just one strike from the small skull.</p>

  <p>Knowing that Luo Luo Zheng was still out there, the ogre martial artists inside the main city began to despair.</p>

  <p>None of them had expected that such a fiend would appear outside the main city. And yet, he was nothing but a human brat!</p>

  <p>By the time Luo Luo Zheng circled around the main city a second time, there was no one outside.</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artists who had been fighting each other had either been killed by Luo Luo Zheng and returned to the main city to be revived, or had fled into the wilderness.</p>

  <p>'It's almost empty. It's time to move to another city, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>It was not until an hour after Luo Luo Zheng had left the main city that a few ogre warriors carefully walked out of the city walls, looking in the direction Luo Luo Zheng had left with traces of fear on their faces...</p>

  <p>In a quiet corner in the wilderness, the Teleportation Token once again appeared in Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>After it was activated, Luo Zheng's figure disappeared from the place with a flash of bright light.</p>

  <p>The next instant, Luo Luo Zheng appeared in a peculiar space. His gaze swept over his surroundings. Raising his eyebrows, he thought, 'Those skulls aren't following me anymore?'</p>

  <p>The Teleportation Token could make Luo Luo Zheng instantly appear in the center of a certain main city. He had wanted to see what would happen if he brought these skulls into the center of any city. However? The skulls had not followed Luo Luo Zheng when he was teleported.</p>

  <p>After choosing a main city, Luo Luo Zheng had descended to that city.</p>

  <p>The main city in front of him was foreign to him. All of the houses in this main city were exquisite, with a round and pointed top. They were built in a style that Luo Luo Zheng had never seen before.</p>

  <p>'The Night Group is a small race in the Upper World. However, the buildings of this group are exquisite and meticulous, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought and looked around as he walked toward the walls of the main city.</p>

  <p>The Night Group was a group that was rich in assassins. Luo Luo Zheng had encountered them before on the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>This group was skilled in the art of assassination, but hiding and assassinating would not take them far. They couldn't become a mainstream force.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng arrived at the city walls, his eyebrows twitched. Those several hundred small skulls were already waiting for him outside the city.</p>

  <p>The Teleportation Token had brought him at least ten million miles away, but it seemed that these little skulls could actually ignore the boundaries of space and reach this place at almost the same time as he had. The sorcerer race's spells were really amazing.</p>

  <p>"Alas?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could only use these small skulls to continue to "clean up" the city of the Night Group.</p>

  <p>Even though the members of the Night Group of the Upper World were adept at assassinations, their skills were useless on Luo Luo Zheng since he had magic vision.</p>

  <p>He found it much easier to clean up this place than cleaning up the ogre city.</p>

  <p>After a few rounds of killing, no one dared to leave the city.</p>

  <p>'I have to move to another place now.' Luo Zheng's eyes were indifferent as he quietly left this main city.</p>

  <p>However, this time, he did not take out his Teleportation Token. Instead, he took out the iron ticket.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had wiped out most sheep of the two cities and had accumulated quite a lot of Illusion Points. However, his ranking was still falling.</p>

  <p>His ranking in this supreme world had fallen below 300th while his ranking in the entire Illusion Battlefield had fallen below 17, 000th!</p>

  <p>If he continued to rely on gathering Illusion Points by killing around these main cities, his rankings wouldn't rise at all.</p>
