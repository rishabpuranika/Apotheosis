</p>

  <p>Nicholas performed the spatial transference once again in order to return to the East Hall.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings freely moved around in the divine land since they had the ability to reach their destination almost instantly, save for a few, specific places.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being in the East Hall waited for a while and guessed where Nicholas might have gone. He unexpectedly came back within five minutes.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was uncharacteristically joyful when he reappeared.</p>

  <p>"What makes you so happy Nicholas?" Jeremiah asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Everyone's gaze fell on Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Come with me!" he told everyone enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>Clark frowned in confusion. "Where?"</p>

  <p>"To the Six-Burden Region," Nicholas answered.</p>

  <p>"The Six-Burden Region?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't that the Han Clan's ancestral land?"</p>

  <p>"Won't the Han Clan be alerted if we go to the Six-Burden Region?"</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that they could literally move freely in the divine land, the Six-Burden Region was the Han Clan's territory and they needed to tell them first before going there.</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't we tell Samuel first?" someone asked. The joy on Nicholas's face faded into disdain. "Ignore him! Just follow me."</p>

  <p>Samuel, to Nicholas, was nothing more than a clown.</p>

  <p>He didn't even consider the Sword Clan and the Moon Clan, let alone the Han Clan and Samuel.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As soon as he said these words, the energy around Nicholas fluctuated and he disappeared.</p>

  <p>Since it was him who said so then the Holy Beings didn't really refute him. They all disappeared from the East Hall one by one.</p>

  <p>A wave of space swept through the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>Nicholas suddenly appeared in mid-air.</p>

  <p>As the Han Clan's ancestral land, the Six-Burden Divine City was much better protected than the Silverwing Divine City.</p>

  <p>The moment Nicholas appeared, the ban above the city was immediately activated and the Thousand Commandments Slate within turned into several blue lightning snakes that shot straight towards him.</p>

  <p>"Someone is trespassing into our Six-Burden Divine City!"</p>

  <p>"Guards!"</p>

  <p>"The opponent can fly. At least a top-rank True God!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods of the Six-Burden Divine City were vigilant and immediately spotted a middle-aged man in the air.</p>

  <p>This man's aura didn't seem to be strong but they couldn't exactly pinpoint his cultivation level.</p>

  <p>"I can't figure out his cultivation level. Is he a consummate True God?"</p>

  <p>"Hard to say. Maybe he uses some kind of cultivation method or has some kind of treasure that helps him hide his cultivation base?"</p>

  <p>"The Thousand Commandments Slate will deal with whoever dares to break in!"</p>

  <p>As soon as one of the True Gods said this, a harsh sound reverberated in their ears.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>A strong lightning snake had reached Nicholas and wrapped around him tightly.</p>

  <p>"The lightning punishment from the Thousand Commandments Slate is very powerful. Even consummate True Gods will have difficulty resisting!"</p>

  <p>"Even if he doesn't die, he's sure to suffer greatly."</p>

  <p>"He must have so much free time. How dare he break into our Six-Burden Divine City? He's courting death!"</p>

  <p>There was a hint of sympathy in the True Gods' eyes. This man was sure to die under the lightning punishment.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>However, just as they were anticipating the man's death, the blue light from the lightning snake suddenly dimmed.</p>

  <p>The figure, however, remained intact.</p>

  <p>This scene stunned them immensely!</p>

  <p>"How could this be?"</p>

  <p>"Who is that person?"</p>

  <p>"The Thousand Commandments Slate didn't work on him?"</p>

  <p>"No, the Thousand Commandments Slate is probably going to release a stronger punishment..."</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Thicker lightning snakes burst out from the Thousand Commandments Slate and headed straight towards the man.</p>

  <p>Nicholas merely huffed at the sight of these snakes.</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hands and appeared to grab something in midair.</p>

  <p>There was a loud bang as a building in the middle of the city suddenly collapsed. From the rubble came a slate that flew towards Nicholas.</p>

  <p>It was the Thousand Commandments Slate!</p>

  <p>The True Gods' eyes almost popped out of their sockets at the sight.</p>

  <p>Those who came from the Han Clan branches also had inconceivable expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>When the Thousand Commandments Slate was in front of him, Nicholas immediately threw a punch.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The Thousand Commandments Slate was supposedly indestructible.</p>

  <p>Thus, after getting punched by Nicholas, it didn't crumble but instead flew away until it was nothing but a black dot in the sky, disappearing into the horizon.</p>

  <p>Silence fell upon the entire Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>All the True Gods held their breaths.</p>

  <p>This freak in mid-air could very well destroy the entire city. There was no way they could possibly defeat him.</p>

  <p>With the slate smashed far away from the city, more Holy Beings began to show up around Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh..."</p>

  <p>There were now more than a dozen figures above the Six-Burden Divine City now.</p>

  <p>Unlike Nicholas, none of the Holy Beings bothered hiding their auras.</p>

  <p>The air was thick in power as the aura of these Holy Beings intertwined and covered the entirety of the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>"Are these people... consummate True Gods?"</p>

  <p>"No consummate True God can have such a horrible aura. These people are the Holy Beings!"</p>

  <p>"Why are there so many of them?!"</p>

  <p>Some True Gods lived their whole lives never seeing a single Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The sight above them was truly unbelievable. They rubbed their eyes, some even checked the expression on other people's faces just to confirm if they were all seeing the same thing? there were indeed more than a dozen Holy Beings in front of them.</p>

  <p>"Is there something here Nicholas?" one of the Holy Beings asked.</p>

  <p>Nicholas narrowed his eyes and gazed at the distance. "One hundred thousand miles to the north."</p>

  <p>He then took a step forward.</p>

  <p>Once again, Nicholas suddenly disappeared.</p>

  <p>The other Holy Beings had no idea what he was trying to do and simply followed him.</p>

  <p>In a flash, all of them suddenly disappeared, leaving only the stunned True Gods in the Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had launched the spatial transference once again and arrived above the Tie Clan. He swept his gaze and saw an array flag.</p>

  <p>"This array flag must have been placed by someone who is at least a consummate True God," Jeremiah said. "It hasn't been here for too long.</p>

  <p>It seems to be guarding something underneath. What could it be?"</p>

  <p>Nicholas smiled. "An extremely important thing."</p>

  <p>As he said this, he immediately shot towards the array flag.</p>

  <p>In the depths of the earth, Lorena, who was within the rock layers, suddenly opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>She looked at Luo Zheng, who currently had his eyes closed as he tried to break through and become a top-rank True God, with indescribable fear.</p>
