  <p>
</p>

  <p>The first time Miles laid eyes on Zheng, he had been too shocked to react.</p>

  <p>In his head, he kept thinking over and over, 'Why did this guy come back?'</p>

  <p>But what happened next stunned him more, that was Darcy's unexpected death in Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>How could Darcy have died this way?</p>

  <p>Was Zheng crazy?</p>

  <p>Darcy was the young master of the Huang Clan. Would the Huang Clan let this pass without retribution given the way he was killed?</p>

  <p>Darcy died on the Luo Clan's territory, and it only meant catastrophe for the Luo family.</p>

  <p>Trembling, Miles asked, "Z..Zheng, do you know who you killed?" He felt terrible after witnessing Darcy's death.</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, Zheng replied, "I already answered that, didn't I?</p>

  <p>I am not in the mood to know."</p>

  <p>"I don't care about your mood. Darcy is the young master of the Huang Clan. Are you aware of this clan? The master of Huang clan, the most powerful clan in C County now, is at grade 5 of the nature level. Darcy died here. All the members of the Luo family will be killed!"</p>

  <p>No longer able to control his fear, Miles howled.</p>

  <p>When the others heard this, they all had a worried expression.</p>

  <p>A fighter at grade 5 of the nature level would definitely be considered a powerful man in C County.</p>

  <p>Was Zheng qualified to resist the Huang Clan?</p>

  <p>Glancing at Miles with indifference, Zheng snapped. "Shut up! Otherwise, you might end up dead, too."</p>

  <p>The look Zheng gave him made Miles tremble even more, as if a viper was staring at him. But he gritted his teeth and retorted, "You... If you dare to kill me, my dad...</p>

  <p>How can my dad... just let you go?" Miles asked weakly.</p>

  <p>"So, if I don't kill you, will Bryson let me go?" Zheng sneered.</p>

  <p>He was slightly enjoying this.</p>

  <p>"Right. You're back this time to court death!" Trying to sound brave, Miles thought of his father and felt relieved. Bryson had greatly improved his strength, broken the pass of marrow refining realm, and reached grade 3 of the nature level.</p>

  <p>"Court death? Me?" Zheng laughed.</p>

  <p>He looked at the pavilion beside the martial arts practicing field and then trod on the wall with one foot. Then he jumped up like a civet cat and instantly climbed to the top of the pavilion.</p>

  <p>From there, he could look down at tier upon tier of buildings, within the Luo mansion.</p>

  <p>It took many years for the Luo family to arrange the buildings, as well as fix the courtyards and pavilions in the mansion, so they turned out exquisite and well-designed, like gardens in foreign lands.</p>

  <p>Zheng muttered to himself, "In the eyes of the noble clans in Imperial Capital, these houses are hardly worth mentioning. But my family has been managed well from generation to generation. I will not allow Bryson to destroy these!"</p>

  <p>Breathing deeply after minutes of introspection, Zheng shouted as he summoned his life vitality. "Brothers of the Luo family, listen to my orders.</p>

  <p>Here is Zheng. I am back!</p>

  <p>All the members of the Luo family, whether young or old, regardless if you are direct or collateral descendants, everyone with the family name Luo, come to gather in the martial arts practicing field! And this is a special call to Bryson and Ken, two bastards!</p>

  <p>Come out to suffer death!" Zheng declared.</p>

  <p>His voice was loud and clear, which was due to that he summoned the life vitality, to help spread his voice far away and even down below.</p>

  <p>Those in the lower basement heard him distinctly as if the voice was right beside their ears. "Zheng?</p>

  <p>Zheng Luo?</p>

  <p>Zheng?" A lot of people kept saying his name.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is back?"</p>

  <p>"Is Zheng coming back?" There were whispers of excitement.</p>

  <p>Every member of the Luo family in every part of the mansion heard his voice and became excited.</p>

  <p>They didn't know what happened, or why Zheng decided to return, but since he was back and dared to come to the mansion, it meant a lot to them.</p>

  <p>At least, Zheng didn't fear Bryson.</p>

  <p>In a pavilion beside a pond, Perrin sat on a wheelchair and stared at the ripples without expression.</p>

  <p>Although the pond and the scenery around it were beautiful, he was in no mood to appreciate them.</p>

  <p>A disabled warrior was like an ordinary person losing an arm or a leg.</p>

  <p>His lifelong pursuit and faith was gone.</p>

  <p>After being disabled by Zheng in their fight on Hell Mountain, Perrin lost his value before the Wang Clan.</p>

  <p>The truth was, Perrin was born to an impoverished family and had no right to claim ties of kinship with the Wang Clan. Perrin might have been somebody in C County, but in the Imperial Capital, he was only a nobody from a humble background.</p>

  <p>Billy could make friends with Perrin because of Yan. The reason for this was that at Cloud Sect, Perrin was the only one related to Yan by blood at that time.</p>

  <p>However, when Zheng appeared in Hell Mountain, Billy and Vale knew that Zheng was Yan's older brother.</p>

  <p>The truth was, even if Zheng didn't incapacitate Perrin on Hell Mountain that day, the Wang Clan would still have abandoned him since he was no longer of use to them.</p>

  <p>So after Perrin was carried away that day, the Wang Clan just sent several people to take him back to C County and even threw him at the gate of the county like a piece of junk.</p>

  <p>And since coming back home, he had never once felt happy but always seemed to be very anxious.</p>

  <p>What if Zheng came back to kill him someday?</p>

  <p>By Perrin's estimation, Zheng would be back in three to five years. As long as he didn't perish from an accident, he would return home sooner or later.</p>

  <p>The day Zheng came back would be the day he would run out of luck, and his father Bryson, as well as uncle Ken, would also face misfortune.</p>

  <p>However...</p>

  <p>He didn't think that day would come so soon.</p>

  <p>When Zheng spoke in his deep voice, it was like thunder from a blue sky that burst in his ears. And Perrin's already pale face turned ashen.</p>

  <p>"Why is he back so soon?" the disgraced fighter murmured.</p>

  <p>He tried to think of a good reason, but failed.</p>

  <p>And unfortunately, there was no one to answer his question. Only two kingfishers quickly flew past the pond, causing ripples that spread slowly.</p>

  <p>In the innermost hall of the mansion, Bryson was cultivating with his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>What made him different from the other members of the Luo family was that everything he knew about Zheng came from Perrin, so he was also worried about the same things as the disabled warrior.</p>

  <p>One thing Bryson knew was the Cloud Sect accepting Zheng as a disciple.</p>

  <p id="top_15">But he was unclear about Zheng's progress later and what happened at the All Peaks Competition recently.</p>

  <p>"He's back after only one year?" Bryson whispered.</p>

  <p>The timing was worrisome.</p>

  <p>Once he learned that Zheng entered Cloud Sect, Bryson had a deep crisis awareness. Under a crisis awareness pressure, he cultivated day and night and broke the bottleneck by accident, thus reaching grade 3 of the nature level unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>It was a miracle for someone who was over fifty years old!</p>

  <p>"So what if you've become an outstanding talent after only one year?</p>

  <p>I have also made great progress. Now, I have reached grade 3 of the nature level...</p>

  <p>If you had been patient and cultivated at the Cloud Sect for ten years, I would probably be scared of you. But after only one year, are you sure you can be a worthy opponent for me? And even if you are my opponent, how can you be sure that he will also see you as his opponent?"</p>

  <p>He kept talking to himself while looking out the hall's window.</p>

  <p>But a squeaking sound alerted him.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the wooden door of the hall was opened.</p>

  <p>"Bryson, Zheng is back!"</p>

  <p>There was panic in Ken's voice as he made the announcement.</p>

  <p>Glaring at his brother, he snapped, "I have ears.</p>

  <p>How could I not have heard such a loud voice?"</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" Ken asked with a hint of desperation. He kept pacing back and forth.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?</p>

  <p>What can we do?</p>

  <p>What other choice do we have but to risk our lives? Release that person!</p>

  <p>We have done him a huge favor, and now it's time for him to repay us!"</p>

  <p>Bryson said.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, Bryson stood up and looked towards the direction of Zheng's voice. He stretched out his hand and his life vitality appeared.</p>

  <p>Thirteen treasured swords hanging on the wall were suddenly unsheathed and floated behind him.</p>

  <p>Then Bryson headed to the Martial Arts Hall.</p>

  <p>Staring at Bryson's retreating, Ken gritted his teeth, and ran in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>He headed towards a cellar in Luo Mansion. This was a special cellar, and nobody knew about it except Ken and Bryson.</p>

  <p>Entering the deep cellar, Ken unlocked a door with two keys. When he pushed the door open, the strong metallic smell of blood from inside assailed his senses.</p>

  <p>A hoarse voice from the inside called out.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"It's Ken!"</p>

  <p>"Do you come to meet me because of that bloke?"</p>

  <p>Hoarse laughter followed. Because of life vitality, Zheng's voice was able to penetrate even the deepest parts of the mansion. So that person inside the room obviously heard him.</p>

  <p>He also heard Zheng call Ken and Bryson bastards and decided he must hold a grudge against the two.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Blood Prisoner. We're asking you to do us a favor!"</p>

  <p>It was humiliating to beg, but Ken had to do it.</p>

  <p>There was laughter again. "That bloke's voice is full of strength. You're coming to me because you can't handle him, can you? He must be very powerful. Do you take me for a fool?"</p>

  <p>The Blood Prisoner laughed a third time.</p>

  <p>But Ken persisted. "Mr. Blood Prisoner, we have offered you much blood and flesh in the last several days, and we let you eat at least ten living people... If we can't defeat that bloke, then most likely no one will help you collect the blood and flesh of living people in the future. And for sure, Zheng will find you. If you are exposed..."</p>

  <p>He was grasping at straws.</p>

  <p>"Are you threatening me? Hmmm. I can help you once. And in return, you need to find one hundred living people within one month for me to suck their blood and eat their flesh!" he said. That was his condition.</p>

  <p>"A hundred living people..."</p>

  <p>Hesitation mixed with desperation showed on Ken's face. There were many people in C County, but it was impossible not to be noticed if one hundred living humans disappeared for no reason. And it would surely mean trouble for the Luo family.</p>

  <p>"Just forget it, if you can't do it. I will simply go somewhere else!" The cold voice spurred Ken to action.</p>

  <p>"I can bring it to you, Mr. Blood Prisoner. I will do as you say!"</p>

  <p>Nodding, Ken bowed and prepared to leave.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha! That's great!</p>

  <p>I will also suck this bloke's blood and eat his flesh!"</p>

  <p>With that said, the Blood Prisoner walked out of the cellar leaving a trail of metallic odor behind.</p>
