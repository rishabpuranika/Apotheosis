  <p>
</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi gazed around him, frowning. "If memory serves me right, this should be a thick snow field," he muttered.</p>

  <p>The field was brown and completely devoid of any snow.</p>

  <p>All the ground within a radius of several miles was sunken to a depth of over a hundred feet.</p>

  <p>It seemed clear what had happened. The Element Spirit Civilization had dug far and wide into the depths of this former snow field.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess shrugged, looking unperturbed. She said, "The Shadow Marks can last for five days. Although the Shadow Warriors didn't monitor us directly, it wouldn't have been difficult to find this place using the marks."</p>

  <p>After entering that road in the Wilderness of No Return, the Snake Goddess had used her shadow to destroy the snow line.</p>

  <p>In hindsight, it seemed to have been a wise decision. Otherwise, they would be blocked halfway by the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>They carefully observed their surroundings, keeping a sharp lookout for anyone from the Element Spirit Civilization. After they had ensured that they were alone, they crossed the snow line and returned to the Freezing Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Immediately, the body of the Wing King began to expand. His human-shaped figure transformed into the form of a giant hawk, with a wingspan at least several hundred feet wide. He spread his wings and the group of people clambered onto his back, whereupon he soared into the open sky above the Freezing Wilderness.</p>

  <p>When they were about a third of the way across the Freezing Wilderness, the leader of the black-robed men turned to Luo Zheng. He bid him goodbye and thanked him one last time.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had decided to follow Luo Zheng as far as he could in order to repay him. Moreover, although their race had always lived in the Dark Region, they had a great relationship with humans.</p>

  <p>While they had been able to offer some help during the fray, the leader was very clear that the true strength of the Night Being race could only be displayed in the Dark Region. Once they reached the Light Region, it would be difficult for them to fight against enemies. Indeed, they would only be a burden.</p>

  <p>Before leaving, the leader gave Luo Zheng a piece of black silk. He explained that it was a way for Luo Zheng to call upon them for assistance? should the silk be torn anywhere in the Dark Region, the Night Being race would instantly know his location. Luo Zheng acknowledged the gesture, and the black-robed man left with his remaining clansmen.</p>

  <p>After they departed, the Wing King spread his wings and rose once more over the vast Freezing Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, they caught sight of a few creatures in the snow below them.</p>

  <p>The creatures watched and pointed at the group flying in the sky, their faces filled with malice, as though they would attack them if given the chance.</p>

  <p>However, the Wing King flew too swiftly for anyone to catch them. Before they could take action, he had turned into a green light and escaped far away.</p>

  <p>Campbell stared out across the vast expanse of white snow. His eyes were hooded, but there was a glimmer of sadness in them. He had always wanted to awaken, but unexpectedly, he had been abandoned after awakening. For a long while he was silent as they flew. Then suddenly, he leaned closer to Luo Zheng and asked, "Can you tell me about what happened in the past? Can you tell me what history you know over the past thousand chaotic eras?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not look surprised at the sudden questions. He nodded and gave Campbell an overview of the chaos history he was familiar with. Of course, there was some sensitive information that he kept to himself.</p>

  <p>Campbell listened closely. When Luo Zheng was done, he asked, "So the two strongest forces in the chaos are the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Luo Zheng replied, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Yet they are only puppets, controlled by unknown forces with their own ulterior motives," Campbell remarked disapprovingly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised an eyebrow, considering Campbell's statement. He said, "I think so too."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng himself had not realized this before entering the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>As he got to know the Treacherous Beings and met Gianni of the Ten Directions House, he had learned more about the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race. In reality, their backgrounds were quite complicated, and a far cry from the simple history he had imagined.</p>

  <p>"You are all alone with no reinforcements. It's really surprising that you have come this far," Campbell observed, turning his head to look at the Eternal Realm warriors on the back of the Wing King.</p>

  <p>Although Campbell had not been very strong back then, he was clear about the strength of this group of Eternal Realm warriors. It was impossible for them to fight against the forces behind the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race.</p>

  <p>"That's right," Luo Zheng agreed. He decided to take the opportunity to request help from Campbell. "I hope that you can help us complete the Finale Way and prevent the chaos from being destroyed again."</p>

  <p>The chaos had been destroyed repeatedly because the Four Spirits Sect needed to extract energy from it.</p>

  <p>Campbell lowered his head, saying nothing. After several moments of contemplation, he said, "If you are correct that the Four Spirits Sect has been exterminated, then it is indeed meaningless to continue destroying the chaos. I can help you to figure out the truth, but I must also save my companions from the Whining Road. I need to awaken them."</p>

  <p>"We will awaken them. I believe it can be done without any trouble," Luo Zheng said with a confident smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and his group had gained a preliminary understanding of the Treacherous Beings from his communications with the leader of the black-robed men on the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings were divided into several types in accordance with their different wishes. For instance, those on the Whining Road belonged to the attaching type. They sought to possess other living beings in order to go to the Pure Sky Platform and retrieve everything they'd had before their death. If they were successful in completing this goal, they would naturally awaken.</p>

  <p>Thus, they only needed to send some creatures into the Whining Road and allow the Treacherous Beings to possess them. The Treacherous Beings would wake up after they went to the Pure Sky Platform to get what they wanted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, and the others. He told them,</p>

  <p>"Master Campbell wishes to awaken his companions."</p>

  <p>They knew Campbell was referring to the one hundred and ninety-nine Treacherous Beings on the Whining Road.</p>

  <p>"Wake them up, you say?" said King Ieuan. It mulled over the idea.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Snake Goddess was thinking quickly, formulating a plan.</p>

  <p>She said, "In that case, we must capture one hundred and ninety-nine creatures on the Other Shore. We will bring them into the Whining Road."</p>

  <p>Fuxi said, "It shouldn't be difficult. Although the creatures in the Three Purities Stage are not to be trifled with, there are still some relatively weak races. As long as we have enough time, we can do it. But of course, the top priority right now is to save the heroes of the human race."</p>

  <p>Based on the plan devised by Luo Zheng and the Primeval Lord of Heaven, they would begin to rescue the human heroes trapped in the underground after entering the Supreme Pure Realm. But they had lost time while Luo Zheng was possessed by Campbell.</p>

  <p>It would take a long time to save the Treacherous Beings on the Whining Road now.</p>

  <p>When Fuxi finished speaking, something began flowing from the back of the Wing King. Dark green liquid oozed out from beneath the feathers. The green substance pooled together and rose to form a body, turning into a human-shaped Green Jade statue.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, ask if this Green Jade statue can be used," the Wing King instructed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked in Sanskrit, "Master Campbell, will your companions possess this Green Jade statue?"</p>

  <p>Campbell studied the Green Jade statue, then nodded. His eyes brightened with satisfaction. "Yes, they will!"</p>

  <p>In fact, the Treacherous Beings on the Whining Road didn't need to possess other creatures to awaken. The reason for possessing other creatures was their desire to use the Light of Annihilation to kill the Treacherous Beings with big heads. But now that all such Treacherous Beings had been killed, they could simply walk straight out of the Whining Road.</p>

  <p>However, they still wanted to realize their long-cherished wishes. The Green Jade statues made by the Wing King would lead them out of the Whining Road and enable them to reach the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>"Well then, we can divide into two groups. I will go to the Whining Road to awaken those Treacherous Beings, and you go to open the underground passage to save the heroes of the human race," said the Wing King gravely.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess nodded. "I agree. It's a good arrangement."</p>

  <p>There was an empty thatched hut since Campbell had left the Whining Road, and it would be safe for the Wing King to enter it alone.</p>

  <p>As soon as everyone had voiced their approval of the plan, the Wing King sent them to the Myriad Pagoda Mountains. Then he changed his route.</p>

  <p>Wings spread, casting an enormous shadow on the ground below, the giant hawk flew alone towards the Blood Swamp.</p>
