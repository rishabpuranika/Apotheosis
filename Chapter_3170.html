  <p>
</p>

  <p>Konnor saw the Killing Sword Sect disciples approaching fast and fierce, and his face changed. "Everyone, stand firm!" he ordered.</p>

  <p>He stamped his foot gently and the giant stone under his feet rolled abruptly. The bottom of the stone pointed at the stone of the Killing Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>The two huge stones slammed into each other, crashing together in a crisp clatter.</p>

  <p>The Flow Sword Sect's stone began to fall upon being hit.</p>

  <p>They were plummeting down, everyone's head facing the ground. If they didn't do anything, they would not only be eliminated but also get seriously injured.</p>

  <p>It was certainly no picnic being smashed by a stone that contained a hundred Jun of force.</p>

  <p>Konnor bit down hard and released the truth aura once more.</p>

  <p>The giant stone was only about five feet from the ground, everyone's head only half a foot away from crashing into the ground. They all flinched to protect their heads from being crushed like watermelons.</p>

  <p>"Rise!"</p>

  <p>Konnor bellowed.</p>

  <p>The stone turned back over, the bottom almost touching the ground itself!</p>

  <p>"Whoa, that was really close!"</p>

  <p>"We were almost knocked out just then!"</p>

  <p>Everyone heaved a deep sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>It would have been a shame to have been eliminated right at the start of the game.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood on the stone with a calm expression.</p>

  <p>Now that he was participating in the Seven Mountains Meeting, he was determined to obtain the premium Other Shore Treasure forged by the Shade Stone. He would have to compete for first place to obtain this prize.</p>

  <p>The beginning of the competition was filled with danger, and Luo Zheng was a little anxious at the start.</p>

  <p>After all, it was the first time that he had attended the game. Konnor was much more experienced, so Luo Zheng had to let him control the stone.</p>

  <p>The Flow Sword Sect was not the only one engaging in a fight with another sect.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Clap!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The collisions of the stones echoed like rolling thunder throughout the cave.</p>

  <p>No matter who rushed toward the metal mountain, they could be certain there were other sects' stones to block their way. Even the stone Feng Ge stood on was challenged by another sect.</p>

  <p>However, the competition had just begun and everyone was still showing a fair bit of restraint.</p>

  <p>As the collisions continued, the giant stones that were originally scattered around the cave were now coming closer and closer to the metal mountain and to each other. Naturally, the tension only thickened.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Hare from the Killing Sword Sect had almost succeeded in eliminating the Flow Sword Sect just now. He had a look of triumph spread across his face, very pleased with himself.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Without Milo, do all members of the Flow Sword Sect become losers? In that case, there's no need to struggle. Just give in and quit now!"</p>

  <p>Hare yelled, laughing heartily.</p>

  <p>The elite members of the Killing Sword Sect released their Other Shore Power again. Their giant stone accelerated towards the Flow Sword Sect's stone from behind once more.</p>

  <p>Seeing this giant stone was about to bash into them again, Konnor snorted in annoyance. With a slight twist, the rear of their giant stone was now aimed at the Killing Sword Sect's.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>When they were hit by the Killing Sword Sect's stone, Konnor held on tight to control their direction, so after the blow, the Flow Sword Sect's stone sped up and dashed forward.</p>

  <p>He was experienced in this game; that was for sure. Not only had Hare not managed to eliminate them, but he had also helped them close a large gap to the metal mountain. Konnor had done very well indeed.</p>

  <p>However, when Hare saw what had taken place, he still had a smile on his face and said loudly, "Kearney, I'll leave them to you!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Zheng looked around and promptly yelled,</p>

  <p>"Konnor, look out! On the right!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The giant stone of the Unique Array Sword Sect flew at them from the right.</p>

  <p>The rule of the game was to fight alone, but it didn't mean that one was not allowed to join hands with another. But even if a few sects united, at the end, there would be only one winner.</p>

  <p>As the champion of the last Seven Mountains Meeting, naturally the Flow Sword Sect attracted the most attention from everyone else. They were being singled out as the one to beat.</p>

  <p>The man controlling the Unique Array Sword Sect's stone was called Kearney Zuo.</p>

  <p>Konnor's worry ramped up again when he saw the Unique Array Sword Sect's stone charging at them. He knew something had to be done and so he turned and shouted, "Mekhi!"</p>

  <p>Mekhi walked into the second rune on the stone and released his Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, just as Konnor had done before.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The rune beneath his feet gave off a purple light and the stone began to shudder wildly. In an instant, their speed was doubled and they sped out, avoiding collision with the Unique Array Sword Sect's stone.</p>

  <p>'The first rune is to control the direction of the stone, and the second is to accelerate it. I wonder what the third is used for, ' Luo Zheng wondered as he watched in silence.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, the stone had slowed back down again.</p>

  <p>Just as the disaster was averted, another deafening bang rang out not far away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned his head to see the Bright Mountain's stone crashing to the ground. Everyone on the stone was thrown off, and their bodies quickly stabilized. No one was injured, but everyone was glum and upset.</p>

  <p>The Bright Mountain disciples were the first ones out of the game.</p>

  <p>And it was none other than Feng Ge who had eliminated them.</p>

  <p>She sat on the rune of the stone and looked down at the embarrassed Bright Mountain disciples. Her face was stony and unrelenting. It was terrifying but garnered respect.</p>

  <p>She then turned her head slightly and happened to catch Luo Zheng's gaze. Her beautiful eyes blinked once before moving on. The stone beneath her floated in a nimble charge towards the metal mountain.</p>

  <p>Her performance was far beyond expectations. No one dared to cross her path, not for now at least.</p>

  <p>As she approached the edge of the first layer of the metal mountain, the weight rune slowly gathered on the stone. It took some time to get the weight rune.</p>

  <p>Just then, a voice spoke from behind her. "I'm sorry, Your Highness!"</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The stone that collided with Feng Ge's belonged to the Ivory Mountain. They had foiled her efforts to retrieve the first weight rune.</p>

  <p>After receiving the first weight rune, one was able to reach the second layer of the metal mountain, and from there, it wasn't far to the final goal.</p>

  <p>Everyone hoped to be on top, so stopping others was all part of the game plan.</p>

  <p>"Let's move forward too!"</p>

  <p>At Konnor's command, the stone circled in the air in an odd angle around the metal mountain. Suddenly, the stones of the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect came from either side at the same time.</p>

  <p>Just as Konnor was about to hurry Mekhi to speed up again, a third stone appeared in front of them. It was Marco of the Vastness Mountain who stood at the front of the stone, proud and menacing.</p>

  <p>Marco had failed to drive Luo Zheng out of the game, and for this, he had declared the Flow Sword Sect his number one enemy.</p>

  <p>The disciples' spirits sank as they realized the situation they were in.</p>

  <p>They had expected to be targeted for sure, and were prepared for it too, but they were not expecting to be attacked by so many sects all at once. It seemed no one would rest until the Flow Sword Sect disciples were out of the competition.</p>

  <p>"Konnor, do you need my help?" Luo Zheng asked, his voice brimming with courage and determination.</p>

  <p>"No, not yet. I can handle it for now," Konnor answered, concentrating on dealing with the crisis at hand.</p>

  <p>They hadn't reached the white-hot phase yet. Luo Zheng was the Flow Sword Sect's secret weapon. If they let him fight now, it would only cost them more in the later stages.</p>
