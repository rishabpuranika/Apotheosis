  <p>
</p>

  <p>The fox girl looked at Zheng with confusion when she heard the panic in the brush-wielder's voice.</p>

  <p>She had learned everything she knew about the Eternal Scroll Painting from the brush-wielder. He had said there were only four origin-level bloodlines in the center of the Eternal Scroll Painting and she believed him.</p>

  <p>That was why she now thought Zheng spoke absolute nonsense.</p>

  <p>But the brush-wielder's response perplexed her and filled her with doubt.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Zheng was not lying.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I entered it," Zheng replied honestly.</p>

  <p>Of course, he could have kept this to himself as the fox girl's request only involved an origin-level bloodline and he was able to display an origin-level bloodline theurgy with ease.</p>

  <p>But his trip to the Eternal Scroll Painting had raised too many questions for him.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the brush-wielder and the fox girl hoped he would grow stronger.</p>

  <p>And he wished to get more information from the brush-wielder, so he was willing to share some of his secrets.</p>

  <p>Zheng's answer caused the brush-wielder's crying face to tremble suddenly and flip it to a smiling face instead. "Then you have given it a try?" inquired the smiling face.</p>

  <p>Obtaining an origin-level bloodline was very difficult and the brush-wielder had high hopes that Zheng would be able to do so.</p>

  <p>As the ruler of the Eternal Scroll Painting, he not only guarded the passage in the chaos but also controlled the passages in other worlds.</p>

  <p>Because of this, he knew better than anyone else how difficult it was to obtain an origin-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The creatures in these worlds were born with defects. If they obtained a root-level bloodline, they would be considered one of the top masters, but if they obtained an origin-level bloodline, they would be able to dominate a world.</p>

  <p>As for the ancestry-level bloodline, it was not meant for the creatures of these worlds. It was the foundation of the existence of the Four Spirits Sect and even their talents had great difficulty in getting the opportunity to enter the sacred cup.</p>

  <p>As far as the brush-wielder could remember, very few creatures were able to enter the Eternal Divine Courtyard, and even fewer had succeeded in merging with the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"I tried," Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"Did you succeed?" pressed the brush-wielder, his voice urgent. He didn't seem to be breathing, if he did he would probably do so quite heavily.</p>

  <p>Zheng stretched his hand towards the fox girl who stood opposite him and a gray aura surged out. It turned into a sharp claw with razor sharp fingertips and grabbed at her.</p>

  <p>The fox girl had a keen sense that Zheng would not kill her, but when she felt the terrifyingly destructive aura emanating from the sharp claw, her soft face lost all its color and turned pale.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>Her snow-white bare feet skipped across the ground as she retreated to the edge of the wall. She was clearly rattled and frightened, with her arms crossed and her chest heaving as she gasped for breath.</p>

  <p>Right from the start, she had been aggressive and overbearing. Zheng's sudden attack would mean punishment.</p>

  <p>He had casually used his bloodline to combine three kinds of energy with the destruction attribute and two kinds with the life attribute. This combination of energy was not all that powerful but it was incredibly intimidating and could cause an extremely powerful spiritual pressure.</p>

  <p>"Well... What sort of ability is that?" The brush-wielder was now even more taken aback.</p>

  <p>Zheng had not displayed just one single ability, but a combination of several.</p>

  <p>This meant he had not only merged with the ancestry-level bloodline, but also possessed its multitude of abilities.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the combination of multiple abilities would only result in four abilities? Infinite Reproduction, Myriad Birth and Destruction, Ultimate Cycle and Infinite Time and Space. These four abilities were separated from the ancestry-level bloodline, meaning they were made up of more than ten kinds of energy from the ancestry-level bloodline, combined in different ways.</p>

  <p>However, the origin-level bloodline and the ancestry-level bloodline were not the same thing, so the talents of the Four Spirits Sect still scrambled for the ancestry-level bloodline. Even if they could only obtain one form of energy by merging with it, it would still be much stronger than an origin-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Those who were able to obtain two or more abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline were the most blessed in the Four Spirits Sect. Such people were few and far between, even for them.</p>

  <p>Of course, the brush-wielder already understood this.</p>

  <p>But when he had witnessed Zheng's demonstration of such a strange ability, he had not considered all that. Instead, he wondered which form of energy among the three hundred and seventy-three forms was this powerful.</p>

  <p>"It's the combination of the sixth, the seventh and the fifty-seventh kinds of energy from the destruction area and the first and thirty-third kinds of energy from the life area," Zheng revealed. He then allowed himself a slight smile when he saw the pale face of the fox girl. "This ability has no name yet. Let's call it 'Energy Intimidation' for now."</p>

  <p>The fox girl was still at a loss for words and the brush-wielder fell silent as well.</p>

  <p>Zheng had really and truly obtained the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>This alone was far beyond the brush-wielder's expectations. It should have been good news but his sudden, terrifying display of the combination of five abilities left the brush-wielder stunned and speechless.</p>

  <p>Even when the Four Spirits Sect was at its peak, only a tiny fraction had obtained multiple abilities.</p>

  <p>What was more, Zheng seemed to imply that he had created the ability on the fly simply to intimidate the fox girl.</p>

  <p>He had merged with more than five abilities, and was able to use them at will.</p>

  <p>This was beyond what the brush-wielder understood. He would need some time to come to grips with it all.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed the fox girl had been scared silly and now looked uncharacteristically pitiful. He withdrew the sharp gray claw and comforted her, "To be honest, this thing only looks scary. It's not actually all that terrifying."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, a green light, made up of three abilities of life attribute, flashed on his fingertip. It surrounded the fox girl in a warm energy. The cold feeling of falling into an icy cave disappeared and was replaced with a bathing of her heart in a spring wind.</p>

  <p>"You are able to use the abilities bestowed by the ancestry-level bloodline freely? How many? Twenty, thirty?" asked the brush-wielder, his voice trembling.</p>

  <p>The fox girl blinked her big eyes in surprise. The brush-wielder was not himself today. He seemed so agitated.</p>

  <p>Zheng had just shown the abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline. The smile on his face now vanished as he barked angrily, "You required me to obtain an origin-level bloodline and I went beyond what you had expected. If you wish to know how many abilities I have obtained, answer my questions first!"</p>

  <p>Too much confusion had accumulated within him.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had once been able to answer most of his questions, and the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had answered the rest.</p>

  <p>But it seemed this was always the way it went: the more he knew, the more ignorant he felt.</p>

  <p>The way ahead seemed carved out by riddles and the further he walked, the more questions he had.</p>

  <p>Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven was unable to explain much of what now took place.</p>
