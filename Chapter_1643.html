  <p>
</p>

  <p>The new rules of the Illusion Battlefield changed the course of the competition and caught everyone off guard. It took three days for the situation to settle down and for the participants to get used to the new rules.</p>

  <p>Many warriors had already fled the cities the moment the rules changed.</p>

  <p>The cities that used to be the safest places in the Illusion Battlefield became the most dangerous ones after the new rules were announced.</p>

  <p>And with nowhere to hide in the cities, most of the warriors had retreated to the wilderness.</p>

  <p>The greedy warriors took advantage of the new rules and wreaked havoc on the cities. They hunted and killed the inferior warriors for their Illusion Points. When the cities were finally exhausted, the warriors had set their eyes on the new target— the endless wilderness outside the cities. The endless wilderness housed all kinds of fierce beasts, and right now, it was also a place of refuge for other warriors who fled the cities to avoid the slaughter. If the greedy warriors were lucky enough, not only would they get Illusion Points from the fierce beasts, but they could also chance upon other warriors.</p>

  <p>The wilderness hunt had begun. The warriors from the entire Illusion Battlefield scattered rapidly— some of them were the hunters, while the others were the prey.</p>

  <p>While most of the superior warriors began their hunt, Luo Zheng had no intention of participating in it.</p>

  <p>He didn't see the need to rush into the wilderness for a few hundred thousand Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Luo Zheng had ranked second in this supreme world. It was quite an accomplishment already. But he didn't want to settle with that.</p>

  <p>His goal was to hunt the other nine top-ten warriors.</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Zheng had no definite plan on how to obtain more Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Up to this point, the warriors that he had slain were not targeted by him in advance. Those were either the prey he had chanced upon or the warriors who tried to kill him but got killed by him instead.</p>

  <p>He then realized that if he wanted to promote his rank in the whole universe, he should focus on catching the bigger lions instead. However, it would still be difficult for him to find the top-ranking warriors in this chaotic and vast sea of people. But first, he had to leave the city and head towards the wilderness.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Janet, Jeffrey and Hailey were more focused on promoting their rankings in the current stage.</p>

  <p>Currently, Janet was ranked 63rd in this supreme world, Jeffrey was ranked the 57th, while Hailey was the 81st.</p>

  <p>Only the top 50 warriors of each supreme world would qualify to enter the second stage. The three weren't too far off from ranking 50th, so with the new rules on play, they could improve their ranking in no time. It looked like fate was on their side.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's team temporarily being dissolved, each member would have the time and focus to improve their ranking at their own pace.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng had finally arrived in the wilderness. He found a corner where he settled in for a while and once again took out the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>He noticed something odd about the spear, but he shrugged it off and poured his chaotic energy into it.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear looked like it saw the rain fall after the long drought. As he poured his chaotic energy into it, sounds of popping beans could be heard, and the surface of the spear started cracking.</p>

  <p>After carefully sizing it up, he discovered that the Saint Killing Spear was slightly bent.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear was made of black and white divine woods that intertwined with each other. The divine wood was the sturdiest wood in the universe and almost indestructible in the heavens.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng could not understand how this kind of wood could be easily bent.</p>

  <p>He took another look and found a bit of green within the chapped crack in the middle of the Saint Killing Spear.</p>

  <p>When he looked closer to examine, he could not believe what was in there.</p>

  <p>Two bright green sprouts were growing in the crack.</p>

  <p>"I know that the divine woods are special and immortal. But these were already forged into the Saint Killing Spear. There's no way they could grow these sprouts."</p>

  <p>There could only be a reason for the sudden growth of these sprouts, and it must have been because of the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>The further he analyzed it, the more his theory seemed true.</p>

  <p>But then again, it was just his theory. He still lacked a deeper understanding of the divine woods. And right now, he was still unclear about the changes occurring within the Saint Killing Spear, and no one was there to explain it.</p>

  <p>He really wanted to bring the Saint Killing Spear out of the Illusion Battlefield. To do so, he had to make a copy of the spear.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had thought of this earlier.</p>

  <p>The spear in Zheng's hands was just an illusion, and the real one in the outside world was in Malachi's hands. After all, it was Malachi who had taken the spear into the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear was most likely located in the core area of the Demon Night race; hence, it would be quite difficult to obtain the spear.</p>

  <p>But if he could duplicate it in the Hall of Causality and take it out of the Illusion Battlefield, would it work like the genuine one?</p>

  <p>No matter what, Luo Zheng had already made up his mind in making a copy of the Saint Killing Spear. Suddenly, a ray of light flashed in his hand and an iron ticket appeared.</p>

  <p>With his current rank, the battle at this stage no longer held much meaning for him. He wouldn't mind spending five million Illusion Points just to enter the Hall of Causality once more.</p>

  <p>Besides, the number of Illusion Points awarded in the Hall of Causality was also decent.</p>
