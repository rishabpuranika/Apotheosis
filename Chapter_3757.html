<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once the Primeval Lord of Heaven unbolted the remaining two chains, the bald giant got to his feet and stepped out of the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>The smooth ice field shone light on him, emitting a primitive, powerful aura.</p>

  <p>The bald giant squatted down and spread his hand towards Zheng and said,</p>

  <p>"My friend, it's time to settle accounts with those bastards!"</p>

  <p>The core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization deciphered his words, causing Zheng to smile.</p>

  <p>He then walked into the palm of the bald giant with Elizabeth and Libby.</p>

  <p>The ice shook as the bald giant walked on the upper ice field.</p>

  <p>The temperature here was low, but not as low as in the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>The moment the frost condensed on the surface of the bald giant's body, it sizzled, turned into hot air, and disappeared.</p>

  <p>The giant's skin turned bright red, steaming heat gushing out of his body and resisting the low temperature of the ice field pretty easily.</p>

  <p>"This place is covered with ice! Where is the Element Spirit Civilization?" the bald giant asked after they had traversed some distance.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not familiar with the Blooming Jade Stage either. But he had already walked through it once before and knew that as long as he walked in this direction to the very end, he could advance to Stage Thirty-one of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Zheng was about to direct the giant in the right way when Elizabeth suddenly said, "Now that this bald giant wants to take revenge on the Element Spirit race, why don't we let him enjoy himself?"</p>

  <p>"Enjoy himself?" Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Since the Element Spirit race controls the Blooming Jade Stage, it would be inconvenient for any other race to go up or down. Zheng, your body has passed the Blooming Jade Stage, but your soul is still in Stage Twenty-nine of the Other Shore. If you want to go to Stage Thirty-two of the Other Shore, I'm afraid it will become troublesome by then. It also won't be easy for your people from the Oneness Sky Palace to pass through the Blooming Jade Stage," Elizabeth reminded him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes lit up at this and he asked to clarify, "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Overturn Stage Thirty of the Other Shore," Elizabeth answered with a shrug.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race had Stage Thirty of the Other Shore under full control. As a result, other races, civilizations, or powerful individual creatures on the Other Shore had no choice but to bear with the Element Spirit race when they passed through the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>If the base camp of the Element Spirit race in Stage Thirty of the Other Shore could be destroyed, other forces on the Other Shore, like the Nihility race, and civilizations in support of the Finale Way, would probably take the chance to enter the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>This was a good opportunity to weaken the power of the Element Spirit race, and there was no reason for them to miss it.</p>

  <p>"Please show him the way," Zheng said, smiling.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth shrugged again. She had been traveling in the Blooming Jade Stage for a long time and was familiar with the distribution of the ice castles belonging to the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Many octagonal ice castles stood at the center of the lower ice field in the Blooming Jade Stage.</p>

  <p>These ice castles weren't very large, but were connected to each other, forming a permanent ice city. The Element Spirit race had even built a thick ice wall on the outer side of the ice city.</p>

  <p>Different types of Other Shore creatures ventured in and out of the ice city.</p>

  <p>Souls of Light, native Other Shore creatures, and former civilizations in the chaos were among them. All of them had one thing in common? every single race had been subject to the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere in the ice city was subdued today. Both the Other Shore creatures and the Five-Element Slaves were unusually silent.</p>

  <p>The troops formed by the Moon Fire Slaves, the Chill Ice Slaves, and the Magical Thunder Slaves had very recently suffered a great loss. Except for the Magical Thunder Slaves having staged a lucky escape, all the Moon Fire Slaves and the Chill Ice Slaves had been killed.</p>

  <p>A round platform carved with ice crystals sat at the center of the ice city.</p>

  <p>The center of this platform shimmered in a strange darkness.</p>

  <p>The Dark Region was so dark that no one could clearly see what was going on inside.</p>

  <p>But the creatures living in the ice city knew what it was covering.</p>

  <p>Many Moon Fire Slaves, Burial Earth Slaves, and Chill Ice Slaves surrounded the round platform and knelt down towards the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>They silently lowered their heads.</p>

  <p>"You are a group of losers!</p>

  <p>There were just two Souls of Light and a corporeal body!</p>

  <p>How could they kill all my Moon Fire Slaves and Chill Ice Slaves?!</p>

  <p>I really underestimated that stupid giant!"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>The voice roared from within the Dark Region for quite a while before a ball slowly floated out of it.</p>

  <p>Blue ice crystals floated inside the ball.</p>

  <p>These ice crystals circled within the ball a few times before forming a little ice man.</p>

  <p>This man was Hosea, a water spirit of the Element Spirit race.</p>

  <p>As the ruler of Stage Thirty of the Other Shore, he had been in charge of everything in the Blooming Jade Stage. He had dispatched troops to the upper ice field to encircle and annihilate Zheng as soon as they had discovered his whereabouts.</p>

  <p>He had thought that it would be very easy to capture Zheng. But in the end, his troops returned in bitter defeat and with heavy casualties.</p>

  <p>This was a result that Hosea could not accept, so he flew into a rage.</p>

  <p>He leaped lightly and his small body emerged from the ball.</p>

  <p>He looked short, but his real body was taller than a human.</p>

  <p>He waved his hands lightly and two blades appeared beside his arms.</p>

  <p>These blades were curved and glinted with cold light that none could explain.</p>

  <p>Hosea was about to lead the Five-Element Slaves on their journey when he spotted a Soul of Light flying towards them in the close distance.</p>

  <p>The Soul of Light was Neal, a powerful warrior of Holy Soul Realm from the Divine Farmer race. He hurried to report his findings to Hosea. "Master Hosea, Zheng has come down. He is at the gate of the ice city!"</p>

  <p>Hosea was stunned.</p>

  <p>He had thought that Zheng would find a place to escape from the Other Shore after surviving the chase of the Five-Element Slaves.</p>

  <p>If that had really been the case, there would have been nothing that Hosea could do with Zheng for the time being. He could only have pinned his hope on the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race in the Source World.</p>

  <p>But to his great surprise, Zheng hadn't escaped. He had, instead, come to him of his own accord. Hosea was overjoyed as he muttered, "I'd like to see what tricks he wants to play!"</p>

  <p>Saying thus, he floated away towards the city gate.</p>

  <p>All the Five-Element Slaves followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>Five minutes before this, pieces of solid ice had suddenly fallen from above the ice city.</p>

  <p>The guards of the ice city were confused. The ice was solid and looked unlikely to fall unless external force was applied to it.</p>

  <p>The guards were still pondering over this when a figure came smashing through the upper ice field from the cave and into the gate of the ice city.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Tell us your name!"</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>These guards were from Other Shore races that were dependent on the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>The strengths of the Other Shore races varied greatly which was proven by the fact that these guards were far weaker than the Five-Element Slaves.</p>

  <p>However, these Other Shore races flourished under the protection of the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng wasn't answering their questions, several guards thrust their spears towards his head.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body flashed as he passed through the guards.</p>

  <p>The guards felt their eyes blur, and their hands become empty, the long spears that they had been holding appearing in Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng threw the spears towards the ice wall, each of them stabbing into it with a terrifying force.</p>

  <p>Zheng jumped up to stand on top of the ice wall with the help of the spears.</p>

  <p>He looked into the distance and smiled as he said, "We should make it bigger."</p>
