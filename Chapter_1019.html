  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Sorry for what?" Yudie replied emotionlessly.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have spoken to you like that," he replied back, his voice hush.</p>

  <p>Yudie pursed her lips. The life vitality in her hand turned into a blue curtain of frost and ice, blocking her from the front. A raging inferno suddenly appeared in the rune and rushed towards her.</p>

  <p>Despite the great power of the raging inferno, it was still unable to break through the wall of frost and ice that Yudie had created.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing that you shouldn't have done. Don't men always do the right things?" Yudie said, her voice as cold as her powers.</p>

  <p>A wry smile graced Zheng's lips. It seemed that Yudie couldn't let go of what happened between Margaret and him.</p>

  <p>At this critical juncture, Yudie brought up old scores again. Zheng didn't know what to say.</p>

  <p>"I admit that I was wrong. I'm so sorry," Zheng said apologetically.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Zheng. It's too late," Yudie replied coldly.</p>

  <p>"Then how will you forgive me?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I'll forgive you if you die," she answered flatly. The wall of frost and ice around Yudie began slowly melting, so she abruptly shot out a strand of life vitality and began to reinforce it once again.</p>

  <p>"As you wish," Zheng replied as he smiled. Without saying anything else, he flew towards River Wave City.</p>

  <p>"What? Wait! Oh no! Zheng!"</p>

  <p>Yudie cried as she saw Zheng rush down the city like a madman. With her eyes as wide as plates, she screamed in her heart, 'Are you crazy?!'</p>

  <p>Although Yudie was currently in a disadvantageous position, she would not die. Even without the help of others, she might still be able to escape the rune.</p>

  <p>The method of combining the powers of tens of thousands of warriors for a single purpose was not without its own flaws, and Yudie was hell bent on finding its weakness. The life vitality that was gathered together itself was extremely complex, not to mention the life vitality of the tens of thousands of warriors that were contributing to it. Even the movements of the six Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists were not the same. As long as Yudie had enough time, she believed that she could find this whole thing's flaw.</p>

  <p>In the past, Yudie would have warned Zheng not to come over. Although she could not break through Heavenly Evil Sect's tactic for the time being, it would not be difficult for her to escape unscathed, especially if she used her trump card.</p>

  <p>With Zheng's sudden involvement, however, things had become much more complicated. As Yudie was sure that Zheng didn't know how terrifying this battle technique was, she started becoming nervous.</p>

  <p>Darius, who was the most important person in River Wave City, sneered when he saw a warrior at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm rushing into the city. "Interesting. Another brainless fly enters the Birdcage."</p>

  <p>The Birdcage was a method of fighting.</p>

  <p>It was a technique that handed down from the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Mainly, it was a technique where the strength of thousands of warriors was gathered. However, Eddie and Simon didn't seem to be good at commanding. On the contrary, Darius was a natural commander, and under his command, the movements of tens of thousands of warriors were highly unified.</p>

  <p>This tactic had its own name, but Darius liked to call it Birdcage. He arranged a cage and waited for the birds outside to rush in. It truly was an appropriate name for what they were doing.</p>

  <p>'What is that guy thinking? I'm able to trap the head of Cloud Hall successfully, and she's at Life and Death Realm! I'll be able to kill him in an instant, ' Darius thought inwardly, chuckling softly. Slowly, he extended his hand and took out a black banner. Then, he waved it in the air, creating a special shape.</p>

  <p>The Illuminating Soul Realm warriors below still continued to send their life vitality upwards, and the Internal Elixir Realm warriors at the middle level were still traveling back and forth. They changed the direction of some life vitality and shot it towards one of the Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Originally, six Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors had set up the giant rune together to trap Yudie inside. But now, three of them changed to use the life vitality sent from below to attack Zheng.</p>

  <p>So basically, half of the strength of those tens of thousands of warriors had been shifted towards Zheng's direction, with the sole purpose of killing him.</p>

  <p>As a result, Yudie felt that the pressure lessened. Even if a ray of life vitality was basically after him, Zheng's face didn't show the slightest trace of fear.</p>

  <p>If Darius knew that the warrior he was trying to get killed was Zheng, he definitely wouldn't have only used half of his power to attack Zheng. But since he didn't know, he thought that it was already enough to kill some unimportant yet exceptionally brave warrior who had the audacity to enter River Wave City.</p>

  <p>As she saw this scene unfolding, Yudie increasingly became anxious.</p>

  <p>Although she could still protect herself from the rune, she wouldn't be able to break through it in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" Darius laughed coldly as he waved the black banner in his hand again. Then, a yellow banner appeared, circling around his other hand.</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>The life vitality of tens of thousands of Illuminating Soul Realm warriors turned into a huge blue electric net that suddenly wrapped Zheng inside. At the same time, the electric net began to contract violently, releasing power that was far stronger than the attacks of ordinary Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Tianming's eyes were tightly shut. He knew that Zheng was facing great danger, which was why he was quick in gathering his strength. The power of the Sword Eye was terrifying, but it took a very long time to activate it.</p>

  <p>On his sides, Patrick and Lewis were standing guard.</p>

  <p>Despite wanting to do anything else, they couldn't as their strength was below his.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>When the electric net reached its limit, it suddenly erupted, leaving a ball of incandescent light in its wake. As the light completely condensed, its momentum and might became comparable to the full force of a Life and Death Realm warrior.</p>
