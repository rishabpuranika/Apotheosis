<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A lot of people were angered by the young group of martial artists that brazenly flew in the reverse direction of the line and broke the rules of flight above Holy City. However, they could do nothing to stop them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, still unfamiliar with the city and not wanting to stir up trouble, merely moved to the side to avoid them.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed fate just had a way of stirring up trouble for him.</p>

  <p>Although he had gone out of his way to avoid them, two young martial artists rushed straight at him. There was a trace of a crazed expression on their faces.</p>

  <p>These two were obviously out for a fight. Unfortunately for them, Luo Zheng wasn't someone who was afraid to retaliate against bullies. He had never hesitated to kill those who offended him in the mine.</p>

  <p>Seeing that these two weren't going to let him go easily, Luo Zheng quickly gathered the energy in his body.</p>

  <p>The two hall leaders paled considerably in fright when they saw this scene. They had been tasked to deliver the young man safely to Holy City, so how could they ever explain themselves if anything happened to him?</p>

  <p>However, there was no time for them to intervene. The two young martial artists were already hurtling towards Luo Zheng at high speed. The only thing they could do was to shout and get Luo Zheng to move away since just one hit from these Soul Sea Realm warriors would be enough to terribly injure him.</p>

  <p>"Dodge! Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>To their dismay, Luo Zheng simply stood in the air and stared at the two men that charged at him.</p>

  <p>The two let out high pitched, mischievous laughter just as they reached Luo Zheng. Strangely enough, Zheng's face also broke out into a smile.</p>

  <p>The two young men relished in their mischief before noticing the strange smile on Zheng's face. This halted their laughter since they were confused as to how a Life and Death Realm warrior still had it in him to smile moments before crashing into two Soul Sea Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>The three inevitably collided with each other.</p>

  <p>A muffled sound reverberated into the air as soon as they all crashed into each other.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>"Oh my gosh!"</p>

  <p>The two masters had closed their eyes, not willing to face the possibility of their supposed ward being severely injured this early on. They didn't expect Luo Zheng to be so unlucky.</p>

  <p>These group of troublemakers were from wealthy families in Holy City.</p>

  <p>Owing to their high status, they were mostly conditioned to look down upon others and mostly got away with their mischief because of their power. It was unfortunate that they targeted Luo Zheng to bully this time around.</p>

  <p>However, the next few moments left everyone dumbstruck.</p>

  <p>Everyone had probably expected him to be badly beaten after colliding with the two warriors but he simply retreated a few hundred feet and remained standing. He couldn't transfer the attacks and his opponents were Soul Sea Realm warriors, but he could still rely on his body to resist the attack. The impact had caused his blood vitality to frantically roll around but it was quickly digested by his powerful physique. Had he really wanted to frighten his opponents, then all he needed to do was to remain where he stood.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was more or less okay. However, the same couldn't be said for the two warriors.</p>

  <p>The moment they crashed into Luo Zheng, they felt as if they had been hurled onto a mountain.</p>

  <p>Their Soul Sea Realm strength should've been enough to save them.</p>

  <p>Just a few days ago, these young warriors got into a fight with someone and smashed over ten buildings, all of which were thousands of feet tall.</p>

  <p>When they saw Luo Zheng, they thought they had found an easy target since he was only a Life and Death Realm warrior who was only around 20 years old. Such a cultivation level was quick to attain in the Upper World so they thought he was a simpleton who they could push around very easily.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had avoided them when they came, so they also thought he would avoid them when they rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, not only did Luo Zheng take them on, he also stood still to withstand their attack.</p>

  <p>It was only after bumping into him that they realized why he had stood still.</p>

  <p>The two grunted and felt something very wrong in their stomachs.</p>

  <p>During the collision, Zheng's explosive power had caused their internal organs to move. Even their inner worlds churned and caused a monstrous wave of life vitality to stir up from within their bellies.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>A fountain of blood spurted from their mouths and both of them became limp and plummeted downwards, smashing onto the ice-cold ground.</p>

  <p>The street market below had mortals scurrying about, going their way.</p>

  <p>One could imagine their shock when two Soul Sea Realm warriors suddenly fell from the sky!</p>

  <p>The mortals who lived in Holy City knew how to defend themselves despite living in a completely different world from the martial artists.</p>

  <p>Despite the initial shock of the two warriors falling onto their market, the mortals quickly gathered themselves together and dispersed, just in case these powerful warriors suddenly rose up from the ground and attacked them.</p>

  <p>Mortals were easy cannon fodder for these warriors who had the capabilities to kill indiscriminately.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Both Master He and Master Shen were flabbergasted at the events that had just transpired. They were glad that Luo Zheng was okay but neither of them could still quite comprehend what just happened. It was surely not what they expected.</p>

  <p>The other martial artists were also in a state of disbelief. Two others from their party flew downwards to retrieve their friends on their backs.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to both Master He and Master Shen, seemingly unbothered from the whole ordeal. "Masters, shall we continue our journey?"</p>

  <p>The two masters merely nodded their heads. They finally realized the reason why Luo Zheng had been chosen by the big shot.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to leave, the group of martial artists quickly protested.</p>

  <p>To them, they had just suffered a great loss which never happened before. It was usually them that beat people up so their pride was greatly wounded. There was no way they were going to let Luo Zheng go. He would have to pay a price!</p>

  <p>"Stop! Don't you dare run away after bumping into my friends!" one of the warriors yelled.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to look at him. "They were the ones who bumped into me."</p>

  <p>"Oh? They bumped into you? Why didn't you dodge then? Why did you just stand there?" another asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sneered, "You good-for-nothings really have nothing else to do but bother other people, huh? You don't have any skills. You don't deserve to live! You are courting death and yet you want to blame me! You are scum!" he spat, stunning these young martial artists.</p>

  <p>They had thought Luo Zheng would take the typical route of defending himself.</p>

  <p>Maybe he would even let the two hall leaders beside him reason for him.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect him to be so scathing with his words!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was someone who had already experienced many things in his life and he understood that there would always be people who were unreasonable. These young martial artists were troublemakers who never learned so he thought it best to teach them a lesson.</p>

  <p>Very few people had ever dared to stand up to these rich, entitled young warriors because of their physical and social power. They also had a group of seniors in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place to back them up.</p>

  <p>There was no way these warriors could be touched.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was different. He went out of his way to scold and embarrass them in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>His scolding enraged these warriors. Reputation was paramount for them, way above their lives in terms of importance. Luo Zheng had just called them scum and it wasn't something they were willing to accept. One warrior came forward. "Do you know who we are?"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>There was a flash of blue light as Luo Zheng activated his space ring. Suddenly, a sharp long sword was pointed at the speaker's throat. "I don't need to know who you are, nor do I care who your elders are. You are mere good-for-nothings who use your backgrounds to do what you want. Do you want to fight me together or one by one? Make your choice now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng truly had no regard for these young warriors.</p>

  <p>His words shocked the two masters even further. They had never seen such an arrogant person, especially considering that Luo Zheng was a mere Life and Death Realm warrior against a whole group of Soul Sea Realm masters.</p>
