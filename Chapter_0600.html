<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 600 A Secret Left Untold (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Several leaders along with the elder Fernandez Fei were waiting anxiously under an arch.</p>

  <p>Among the five leaders, the most anxious one was surely Kenneth.</p>

  <p>Three disciples of Cloud Sect had taken the Death Road and he had heard nothing from them ever since. He didn't know what happened to them, but the first thing that came to his mind was they didn't make it.</p>

  <p>Auspice Sect, Iridescence Sect and Cloud Hall had one elite disciple each that took the Death Road. The Cloud Sect, on the other hand, might lose all his elites in the Death Road. So compared to Cloud Sect, the two sects were still fortunate.</p>

  <p>At first, Kenneth had high hopes for these three disciples.</p>

  <p>The three disciples could rank first or second in the other sects.</p>

  <p>So, he had thought that in the Cloud Road test, the Cloud Sect disciples would be able to make a splash and bring honor to the sect and himself.</p>

  <p>But he did not expect that they would suffer heavy losses on the Death Road.</p>

  <p>Aside from Kenneth, several leaders of the other sects and Fernandez also looked worried.</p>

  <p>The death of Frank might not affect the status of Elder Fernandez, but how could he explain it to Frank's father, Emanuel?</p>

  <p>Just as their faces were clouded with worry, the crystals on the arch suddenly lit up and the cyclone whirled faster.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Fernandez was surprised, "What is going on? Has someone come out?"</p>

  <p>"How could it be possible? No one could ever pass the test so quickly!"</p>

  <p>Kenneth was startled to see that as well.</p>

  <p>But they soon calmed down and thought about it in their minds: Through the Picture Slab, they got to know that most of their disciples were still struggling in the fourth stage and that there was still a whole fifth stage of the Cloud Road waiting for them. They estimated it to be at least a few more hours before they could get out.</p>

  <p>But if anyone was to come out at this time, it could only be the group led by Frank.</p>

  <p>So, did they pass the Death Road?</p>

  <p>Just as when the leaders were expecting to see Frank and his team, a figure suddenly emerged from the cyclone.</p>

  <p>"Zheng!" Kenneth suddenly called out with great excitement and agitation at the same time.</p>

  <p>It was hard for the other leaders to fathom what Kenneth was feeling at that moment.</p>

  <p>He had always believed that Zheng had good luck on his side and that his fate was already arranged by God. After he found out that Yan was Zheng's sister, he had an intuition that Yan was guiding Zheng all the way. Even after the martial artists stepped into the Internal Elixir Realm, most of them still believed in the disembodied thing called fate.</p>

  <p>In Kenneth's opinion, Yan's tragic experience was fated by God to push Zheng to run toward the peak of martial arts.</p>

  <p>Although it sounded like nonsense, he still believed in it. Somehow, he had confidence in Zheng and believed that he would not die easily in the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>At that moment, his expectation became reality, and of course, he got excited. And what made it more exciting for Kenneth was that Zheng got the first place in the Cloud Road test!</p>

  <p>In the past, the first place had always belonged to the Cloud Hall disciples and there had been no exception.</p>

  <p>Until then, Kenneth couldn't even imagine a Cloud Sect disciple winning the first place. But Zheng indeed broke the tradition and even completed the Cloud Road with astonishing speed.</p>

  <p>Normally, the first disciple would not come out until 150 or more supreme crystals with life vitality were consumed. But this time, only after a hundred supreme crystals were consumed, Zheng came out. Did he find a shortcut?</p>

  <p>At the sight of Zheng, the leader of Iridescence Sect, Lady Long, and the leader of Auspice Sect, an old man in white, craned their necks to look behind Zheng hoping to find their disciples.</p>

  <p>But even after waiting for a long time, no one came out after Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lady Long's face suddenly darkened. She rushed toward Zheng like a ghost and put her stick to Zheng's throat. With one wrong move, Zheng would die.</p>

  <p>She then snapped, "Hey, you! Tell me where Lois is?"</p>

  <p>Lady Long was at Internal Elixir Realm. She had great strength and power.</p>

  <p>As a martial artist, her strength was on a par with Kenneth's. She released strong energy that overwhelmed Zheng like a mountain. Her presence made him unable to breathe properly. If disciples with weaker strength were suppressed by the energy, then at best, they would feel their spiritual energy and blood being obstructed; or worst, they would get injured and fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>After passing the Cloud Road, Zheng's spiritual energy had become stronger. He had not only soaked his body in the flood dragon's blood but also had eaten the blood vigor of that nine-headed dragon. So, in the face of the overwhelming power, he suffered an energy stasis but quickly recovered.</p>

  <p>Lady Long's arrogance annoyed Zheng. He was a stubborn person with instinctive obstinacy. If she had asked him nicely, he would tell her the news about Lois. But she didn't. Therefore, Zheng replied plainly, "I have no idea."</p>

  <p>"You have no idea? How can it be possible?" Lady Long sneered, "You took the Death Road with Frank and the others. I have seen it with my own eyes! How dare you lie to me? If you don't tell me the truth, I'm afraid that your good luck won't help you today! So, you'd better…"</p>

  <p>Lady Long was in the middle of ranting when she suddenly felt a dangerous force approaching.</p>

  <p>She took a deep breath and backed away. Then, a shadow of a huge fist appeared at her feet. The impact of the fist shadow hitting the ground left a big hole on it. The ground tiles, the stones, and the mud under the ground tiles, were all wiped out by the force.</p>
