<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng visited the Truth Library for the first time, he was very interested in the Sword Texture Technique.</p>

  <p>However, back then, he hadn't even reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>Therefore, his cultivation level was too low for the technique, so he didn't cultivate it.</p>

  <p>If the Sword Texture Technique was as formidable as they described it to be, then it would make an unfathomable combination with the Eye of Will.</p>

  <p>After practicing in seclusion for a few days, Luo Zheng was satisfied with what he had obtained from cultivation.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was preparing to leave the Sword Tower, the guardian of the tower Sellers approached him with reluctant steps.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing him approach so timidly, Luo Zheng looked bewildered and asked,</p>

  <p>"Master Sellers, what's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I just came here to remind you of something. No matter what you do, just don't offend Milo," Sellers said with a concerned look.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng fought against Milo at Dragon City, Sellers had witnessed the fight from afar, and he had been looking for an opportunity to warn him.</p>

  <p>After that battle, Luo Zheng had left for the Mountain Viewing Province for a task and didn't show up at Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Sellers remained at Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>He was one of the old-timers from the Taiyi Heaven Palace. In his eyes, Luo Zheng was a prodigy disciple with many talents. However, he also knew Milo was no ordinary disciple, at least not someone who should be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Milo was one of the extraordinarily talented disciples from the younger generation. According to Sellers, Luo Zheng could not compare to him in strength.</p>

  <p>Of course, if Sellers knew why Milo had sparred with Luo Zheng, he would never have warned him like that.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your concern. I will be careful," Luo Zheng nodded and bowed to him respectfully.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was never the type to intentionally provoke others, but if someone tried instigating a fight with him, he was not someone to hold back either.</p>

  <p>However, Sellers had shown affection to him by warning him. Therefore, he chose to not embarrass him by telling him the truth.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Sword Tower, Luo Zheng went straight to the Truth Library. He showed no signs of reluctance and went straight up to the third floor.</p>

  <p>After he entered the illusion on the third floor, he heard a familiar voice of the man guarding there.</p>

  <p>"Have you come to buy some new swordsmanship manuals today?"</p>

  <p>The man sounded much friendlier than the last time Luo Zheng visited, maybe it was because of Luo Zheng's acquaintance with Dorothy.</p>

  <p>It had not been long since Luo Zheng last came to buy two manuals.</p>

  <p>Normally, it would take a significant amount of time for people to finish learning a manual before they could come for another. But Luo Zheng was already here to purchase more. 'How is this possible? Did he really manage to learn the two manuals so quickly?' the man wondered to himself.</p>

  <p>"Sir, can I still enjoy the last discount this time too?" Luo Zheng asked as respectfully as he could.</p>

  <p>Last time, when he was with Dorothy, the man allowed him a 40% discount off the usual price. It would save him a lot of divine crystals if the man agreed to grant him with the same discount again.</p>

  <p>"Since you are Dorothy's friend, it is my pleasure. You can just choose what you want to purchase," the man responded with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir!" Luo Zheng said with a broad smile.</p>

  <p>The friendliness of Dorothy's "Uncle Wilfred" piqued Luo Zheng's curiosity so much that he was almost enticed into using his Eye of Will to see his appearance through the illusion. However, since this man had never revealed himself, Luo Zheng decided it would be disrespectful and inappropriate to intrude on his privacy. Besides, he did not want to offend him after he was so kind to him. Suppressing his inner curiosity, Luo Zheng walked ahead towards the light column of the Sword Texture Technique.</p>

  <p>"In addition to the Sword Texture Technique, I also want to borrow the yellow paper," Luo Zheng said politely.</p>

  <p>"Are you really that interested in the yellow paper?" the man asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," replied Luo Zheng firmly.</p>

  <p>"It costs ten million divine crystals to borrow it. Even if I offer you a 40% discount, it will still cost you six million divine crystals. Moreover, you can only borrow it for one single day. You are not allowed to show it to others on that day," the man repeated the rules to Luo Zheng. He then continued, "In fact, you're not the first person who came to borrow the yellow paper. This is the original manual of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Many people want to benefit from reading it, but they all failed in the end."</p>

  <p>As the origin of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was a perfect Truth of Godly Way and was on the same standard as the other twelve Truths of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Even the Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself could not improve the Truth of Godly Way any further, let alone others.</p>

  <p>Even after hearing all the complications, Luo Zheng still borrowed the yellow paper and purchased the Sword Texture Technique, and then he left Dragon City.</p>

  <p>This day marked the end of his ten-day stay at Dragon City.</p>

  <p>During this stay, Gant had settled Eira down and had returned the Snow Sword to Luo Zheng after he repaired it in the Su Clan.</p>

  <p>Soon, night fell as the moon chased away the sun and all its brightness.</p>

  <p>A deep silence reigned the outskirts of the Dragon City. Everyone started to quietly cultivate under the flags.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, Luo Zheng sat down and focused on setting up an enchanted barrier to isolate himself from others, and then he took out the yellow paper.</p>

  <p>He was only allowed to keep it for one day, so he had to make the most out of the time he had.</p>

  <p>The surface of the yellow paper was smeared with a layer of glaze crystals.</p>

  <p>Eight Sanskrit words were written on it.</p>

  <p>As he read them, he recalled his time back in the fairy palace of the divine land when Geoffrey managed to decipher the Truth of Cultivation Nature on his own. Realizing how difficult it appeared to him now made Luo Zheng appreciate Geoffrey's efforts and praise him.</p>

  <p>It was widely known that the most important reason why Eastern Emperor Taiyi could be so famous and well-respected today was that he had deciphered the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. This proved how much one had to struggle to be able to decipher a certain Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng patted his hands together, he sent the yellow paper into his elixir field. Simultaneously, he created an avatar of himself in his inner world who reached out and grabbed the paper and then emerged next to Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Seeing his father's avatar fill his field of vision, Geoffrey became infuriated.</p>

  <p>Apparently, he was still furious at Luo Zheng for throwing him down from the sky the previous day.</p>

  <p>Reading his expressions, Luo Zheng knew he had to comfort him, "The demonic eye is very dangerous. I had no choice but to send you away yesterday before I could settle it down."</p>

  <p>After his father explained earnestly, the tensed expression on Geoffrey's face softened up a bit. He said sullenly, "Tell me now. What Sanskrit words do you want me to decipher for you?"</p>

  <p>"How did you know that I'm here for this?" Luo Zheng asked with his brows raised in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You've never needed me for anything else," Geoffrey said, with a hint of sorrow.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was rendered speechless. He never realized that he was neglecting his family amidst everything. It seemed that he should spend more time with them.</p>

  <p>Overwhelmed with guilt, Luo Zheng still handed the yellow paper over to him.</p>

  <p>Just as he laid his eyes on it, Geoffrey became excited. He stared at it intently as if he couldn't look away, "What complicated Sanskrit words!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The more complicated a Sanskrit word was, the more information it contained, and the more difficult it was to decipher it.</p>

  <p>"The first six Sanskrit words seem to record the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, and I already have their translation. Can you decipher the last two Sanskrit words for me?" Luo Zheng requested.</p>

  <p>"These two Sanskrit words are complicated..." Geoffrey looked even more closely at the yellow paper, and the solemn look on his face became more obvious than before. He said, "I'm afraid it will take me some time."</p>

  <p>Simple Sanskrit words were easy to decipher for him, and he could do it at first glance. However, the complicated ones were harder to comprehend and thus took more time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded in reply. He didn't expect Geoffrey to decipher them right off the bat either. However, the paper could only be borrowed for one day, and he had little time on his hands.</p>

  <p>With a gentle stroke of his palm, Luo Zheng summoned a stone tablet in his hand.</p>

  <p>He attempted to copy the Sanskrit words on the yellow paper, but the copied words had lost their might and charm.</p>

  <p>Glancing side-ways at the crooked Sanskrit words on the stone tablet, Geoffrey pouted mockingly and looked at his father with a strange expression.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Zheng thought of something and said, "Wait a minute."</p>

  <p>He had forgotten that the Sanskrit words couldn't be copied freely, but he still had some duplicating stone tablets in his possession that he had got in the divine land.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng took out a duplicating stone tablet, he aimed it at the yellow paper and tried to copy the Sanskrit words again.</p>

  <p>But it was to no avail, as the Sanskrit words on the duplicating stone tablet were still blurry and crooked.</p>

  <p>"The Sanskrit words on the yellow paper cannot be copied," Luo Zheng concluded with a disappointed face.</p>

  <p>But then, Luo Zheng quickly reached out and sealed off the surrounding space, slowing down the time flow rate as much as possible to buy them some time. This was the only thing he could do to help Geoffrey.</p>
