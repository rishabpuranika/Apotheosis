<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1337 Speculation </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The world lord, Saint Lord, and even the elders were all extremely intelligent people.</p>

  <p>They could deduce everything based on a tiny hint and grasp a vast understanding of things that normal people would have trouble figuring out.</p>

  <p>Zheng was shouting loudly. And Yolande heard him shouting. This was not hard to figure out!</p>

  <p>In the entire universe, only the Roaring Token was capable of such a feat. Nothing could even come close to it.</p>

  <p>Then they remembered something— a while ago, there seemed to be a mysterious young man who spent over ten thousand Roaring Tokens at once. Could it be that Zheng was the young man? What were the odds?</p>

  <p>When they thought of this, they all stared at Zheng in shock. Their eyes were wide as they processed what this all meant.</p>

  <p>It was then that they realized how the other people around him were also staring at him as though they had been shocked by lightning. It was amazing how he didn't look fazed at all, despite the exchanged glances and low murmurs. This only confirmed their speculation as their throats dried up. They regarded Zheng with appalled eyes, more aghast than ever.</p>

  <p>Did this guy have Roaring Tokens in his hand? And there were so many of them!</p>

  <p>The atmosphere in the large hall became strange and restless.</p>

  <p>But after thinking about it some more, they began to deny their own guesses. One by one, they cast doubts upon themselves and their ability to perceive things.</p>

  <p>This was simply impossible.</p>

  <p>Where did a warrior from the Lower World get so many Roaring Tokens? They couldn't imagine what he had to go through just to get his hands on them. Could he have done something really drastic? Could he have exchanged something vital in order to possess the Roaring Tokens?</p>

  <p>What Zheng did not know was that, ever since he used the Roaring Token to clamor throughout the universe, the discussions and speculations about his identity spiraled out of control. For a long time, they kept wondering about who he really was, and even until now, they had not stopped.</p>

  <p>They still couldn't figure out the identity of the mysterious woman before. Then here came a young, mysterious man, who they also couldn't unravel so easily. The only difference was that while the mysterious woman started beast attacks in the universe through singing, the mysterious young man didn't do much harm to the universe. He was at least gentler than the woman.</p>

  <p>However, it was hard for them to prove their speculations. The universe was vast, and it would be impossible for them to find someone who had used the Roaring Tokens among the 100, 000 supreme worlds. As long as the man didn't show himself, they would have no way of finding out.</p>

  <p>The problem was that Yolande had purposely said it, making the impression that Zheng was the one who used the Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>The reason why the world lord of the Spirit Reading World and the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place thought it was impossible for Zheng to be the young man was that they thought even a Supreme Lord would not be able to own so many Roaring Tokens. So how could a warrior from the Lower World possibly own them?</p>

  <p>Upon thinking of this, the world lord smiled in embarrassment. Although he knew that Yolande probably wouldn't speak the truth, he still couldn't help but ask, "Master Yolande, what did you mean by saying that?"</p>

  <p>Yolande smiled cunningly and made an excuse. "When I was in the Lower World, I gave him a message rune. After he ascended, he begged me to take him away every day. He had probably been living a miserable life in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, so he cried very loudly. That's what I meant!"</p>

  <p>This explanation was too far-fetched, not to mention unbelievable.</p>

  <p>At this moment, everyone in the hall, including the world lord, the Saint Lord and the elders, rolled their eyes.</p>

  <p>Yolande was talking nonsense as expected.</p>

  <p>A message rune of the Lower World could only cover a distance of 70, 000 to 80, 000 miles. It was not enough to cross a world. When Freya had left the mine, the message rune that she gave Zheng was considered the best one in the Lower World. They didn't know of anything that could have topped that.</p>

  <p>The runic experts in the Upper World were more skilled, but the furthest sound transmission distance was less than 200, 000 miles. The distance of 200, 000 miles was not even enough to cover the entire Spiritual Force Sacred Place. So it was really impossible for Zheng to contact Yolande, who was in another supreme world, with just a message rune. Everyone rolled their eyes as discreetly as they could.</p>

  <p>The problem was that although Yolande was talking nonsense, no one dared to question her. The world lord merely smiled and stayed silent. He was at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he was also cursing Yolande quite aggressively in his mind.</p>

  <p>'It's fine if you know that I have a Roaring Token, but why did you give everyone a hint? Are you trying to threaten me?'</p>

  <p>But as he surveyed the situation around him, Zheng could tell that Yolande's status was indeed not ordinary. The Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place did not dare say anything before her, and the one who had just spoken seemed to be even more powerful than the Saint Lord. 'Is he the world lord of the Spirit Reading World?' Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't care who the man was. What was important was that his secret wouldn't be revealed. Although these guys had guessed a little of the truth, they didn't seem to believe that he had so many Roaring Tokens.</p>

  <p>But in the end, he knew it was still inappropriate to arouse others' suspicions.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not stupid enough to argue with Yolande about this. If they had doubts in their hearts, then let them be. After all, no matter what conclusion they reached, they wouldn't be able to give it any certainty.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place saw that it was about time, so he said, "Master Yolande, Zheng has, after all, ascended to our Spiritual Force Sacred Place. Now that you want to take him away, shouldn't you give us some— "</p>

  <p>Before the Saint Lord could finish speaking, the corners of Yolande's lips curved up in a smile. Then she immediately declined. "No!"</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place almost fainted. He wanted to ask for compensation, but he didn't expect Yolande to directly reject him before he even said it out. Wasn't she too overbearing?</p>

  <p>However, since the words were already out of his mouth, he clenched his teeth and continued, "Actually, we don't care about compensation. But one of the disciples from the Myriad Spiritual Force House is very talented. Can he enter one of the thirteen palaces to cultivate?"</p>

  <p>Yolande giggled, but this time she nodded. "Why didn't you just say it in the first place? Why did you have to mention compensation first? You are really scheming. Sending two or three disciples into the thirteen palaces is no problem!"</p>

  <p>The Saint Lord forced an embarrassed smile. It turned out that Yolande had already seen through him. Originally, he was afraid that she would turn him down, so he wanted to ask for compensation first before taking a step back in exchange for Fenton's entry into one of the thirteen palaces. This was the safest method.</p>

  <p>However, he did not expect Yolande to act like this and agree with it so easily. Now that Fenton could enter one of the thirteen palaces to cultivate, it seemed that Zheng had brought him some benefits after coming to the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Beside him, the lord of the Spirit Reading World became rather excited when he heard this. Knowing that Yolande could give them two or three licenses, his eyes immediately lit up.</p>

  <p>In fact, every once in a while, the 3, 000 supreme worlds would obtain a few licenses to the thirteen palaces. As the Spirit Reading World was relatively remote and was unknown within the supreme worlds, the number of licenses they had at their disposal was naturally fewer. So being able to obtain extra spots was a huge thing. The world lord was just about to open his mouth and say something when Yolande extended three fingers. "That's it. Since Zheng has ascended to your Spirit Reading World, I'll give you three licenses. As for how to allocate them, it's your own business."</p>

  <p>Of the three licenses, one was already occupied by Fenton, which meant that the remaining two would depend on how they divided it up.</p>

  <p>Although the Spiritual Force Sacred Place already obtained a license, the Saint Lord thought that the licenses were granted because of Zheng. It was fine for them to obtain an extra license, but the world lord did not think so. It could only be said that the Spiritual Force Sacred Place was lucky to have Zheng, but the fact remained that it was too much for a sacred place to have two licenses.</p>

  <p>After Yolande brought Zheng and left, a dispute started between the two sacred places because of the remaining two licenses. It even involved another tenth-grade sacred place in the Spirit Reading World. The Saint Lord of the tenth grade sacred place thought that the three licenses should be given to the three sacred places, one for each.</p>

  <p>There was a carriage floating above the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The purple carriage was made with incomparable ingenuity. Strings of strange flowers and plants grew around the body of the carriage.</p>

  <p>The most astonishing thing was the two horses in front of the carriage.</p>

  <p>They were actually legendary beasts!</p>

  <p>Normally, legendary beasts were very arrogant and proud. They could enter into a contract with warriors and become their contractual beasts, but they could not be enslaved or tamed by warriors.</p>

  <p>This "Heavenly Phoenix Horse" was one of the few legendary beasts that could be tamed, but even taming it would take a lot of energy and time.</p>

  <p>So not only was the Heavenly Phoenix Horse an excellent mount, it was also a symbol of status.</p>

  <p>The rest of the people respectfully saw Yolande off as she brought Zheng into the carriage.</p>

  <p>Judging from the outside, the spectators thought that this carriage was only the size of an ordinary carriage. However, after the doors were opened, a different world inside greeted them. It was as wide and wonderful as a palace.</p>

  <p>"Tell me. Where did you get so many Roaring Tokens?" Yolande asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Um..." Zheng found it hard to explain.</p>
