<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2246 Arrogance </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The news about Sheridan's death had not spread yet. At the very least, no one from the Xie Clan had come to the Floating Island of Han Clan to seek revenge, for now.</p>

  <p>However, the Han Clan still took the matter seriously.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Xie Clan and the Liu Clan� which ranked last, both didn't have high status nor much authority in the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Although the two clans were both led by Holy Beings, they didn't have a strong foundation. Therefore, they were most likely to fall into the Time Sea if they were in a fierce competition.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the wealthy and powerful clans must be guarded by Holy Beings, but it didn't mean that a clan with Holy Beings was qualified to stay above the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>There were indeed some clans in the divine land that were not powerful enough but had a Holy Being in their families. Their comprehensive strength did not qualify them to enter the Time Sea, or to have a Floating Island to their name.</p>

  <p>Therefore, to enter the Time Sea did not depend on a Holy Being, but on the whole clan's comprehensive strength.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Han Clan was not afraid of the Xie Clan to the point that even the death of several core disciples was not a big deal for them.</p>

  <p>However, the Xie Clan had good relationships with some powerful clans on the Floating Islands. Moreover, the Han Clan should be responsible for the problem, and they would be in trouble if the Xie Clan wanted to avenge Sheridan's death.</p>

  <p>On top of that, the Han Clan had to get everything ready. However, Alfredo needed to figure something out first.</p>

  <p>"Please tell me your name," said Alfredo, who was in the middle of the hall.</p>

  <p>Despite his calm tone, there was an undeniable edge to his voice. It was like thunder that resounded in Zheng's ears, which made him seem like he was the only God between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>That was the Mu Ning that a God should have.</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng looked up at the clan leader in front of him. He had never seen such a character like the man before. He was so shocked that his facial muscles refused to move and make any expression at all.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo," Luo Zheng replied flatly.</p>

  <p>"Do you know why you are tied here?" Alfredo asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard the question, he couldn't help having a sinking feeling in his chest.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the top masters of the rich clans in the divine land also liked to talk a load of garbage.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan had tied him up and brought him to this place just because he had killed Sheridan. He didn't have to answer such a question again.</p>

  <p>'Do the True Gods present intend to set up a court trial?' Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>"I'm very curious. You are all the top martial artists in the divine land, while I am just a proving godly warrior. Why did you tie me up like this?</p>

  <p>Are you afraid that I will escape?" he suddenly asked. The smile on Alfredo's face instantly froze at that moment.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the core disciples of the Han Clan, almost all the other warriors who could step into the Spiritual Heart Hall were top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Heart Hall was known for its oppressive surroundings. Not even ordinary True Gods dared to voice out their opinions there.</p>

  <p>Thus, they were utterly shocked to see that Luo Zheng, who was just a proving godly warrior, was so fearless and was unaffected by the hall's strong Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>Now, Alfredo believed that Luo Zheng was indeed capable of killing Sheridan.</p>

  <p>"How dare you! How dare you be so rude to the master of the Han Clan!" a top-rank True God nearby coldly shouted. His voice was so sharp that it was literally like a blade that flew straight towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The young proving godly warrior suddenly felt a dense stab of pain in his face and chest, especially in his ears.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>The sound pierced through his eardrums, and then two streams of blood gushed out of his left and right ears.</p>

  <p>It rendered him temporarily deaf, yet there wasn't a trace of fear on his face. "Since you brought me here, you might want to ask me something.</p>

  <p>However, since you made me deaf, I'm afraid I can't hear your questions!" he said simply.</p>

  <p>That top-rank True God couldn't help losing his temper upon hearing Zheng's words. But after careful consideration, he realized that Luo Zheng couldn't hear him at all because his eardrums were broken. Thus, he didn't know how to deal with him at all.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Alfredo smiled again. He didn't mind Zheng's rude remarks at all. He gently waved his hand, and then a green light spread throughout his palm. The green light expanded into a bigger ray of light and spread throughout the whole Spiritual Heart Hall. When the light had touched Luo Zheng, he quickly felt a warm sensation that came from the surface of his body. At the same time, the pain in his ears was gone. His deaf ears were healed.</p>

  <p>"You're the first one who dared to speak like this in the Spiritual Heart Hall," Alfredo said slowly as his eyes locked with Zheng's. "Some people have been brave enough and righteous, not afraid of others' attacks, but some pretend to be calm and try to gain recognition. I wonder if you're the first type of people, or the second type."</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could answer, Alfredo continued, "But it doesn't matter...</p>

  <p>Please get up!" Once he had finished speaking, he stretched out two fingers in the air and gently made a pinching motion. The ropes that bound Luo Zheng were immediately broken. He did feel relaxed, although he was surprised to see that Alfredo even helped him untie the ropes.</p>

  <p>As he got up and stretched, Alfredo added in a frank voice, "I think you know why I summoned you to the Spiritual Heart Hall today. A member of the Xie Clan came to my Floating Island for stirring up trouble. He has been killed, but it is no big deal. There is no reason for our clan to feel pity for him. However, if the Xie Clan comes over and bothers us about this matter, we aren't willing to bear the consequences. Although you're not a member of our clan, we decided to give you a chance. If you were me, what would you do about this situation?"</p>

  <p>Alfredo, the master of the Han Clan, even gave Luo Zheng a chance. Such was truly an unprecedented privilege. Had it been anyone else or any other True God who had killed Sheridan, the Han Clan would immediately disown them and hand over the killer to the Xie Clan without question.</p>

  <p>Therefore, all the senior leaders of the Han Clan were astonished when they heard Alfredo's words. That was not how Alfredo dealt with things!</p>

  <p>Of course, Alfredo naturally didn't want to make the whole situation worse.</p>

  <p>However, his beloved daughter Kelsey had repeatedly told him how Luo Zheng had helped her and how he had offended the rich clans' disciples just because of her and Aleyna. That was why Luo Zheng had no choice but to fight and kill Sheridan in the end. Kelsey constantly begged the Han Clan to protect Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>To add to that, Pascal also told Alfredo that Han Liusu would choose to die if the Han Clan handed Luo Zheng over to the Xie Clan and let them kill him.</p>

  <p>Once again, luck was on Zheng's side as the core disciples of the Han Clan tried to protect him to such extents!</p>

  <p>All of those reasons caused Alfredo to be quite interested in Luo Zheng now. He wanted to see what on earth Luo Zheng was capable of, and whether he was qualified or not.</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng took a deep breath and looked around with his piercing gaze.</p>

  <p>"To be honest, if the Han Clan allowed the Xie Clan to take me away, I'm afraid that it might be the stupidest thing you'd do since the beginning of the divine era," he said slowly.</p>

  <p>Such bold words from a mere proving godly warrior shocked the senior leaders of the Han Clan to their core.</p>

  <p>On the left side of Alfredo, a middle-aged man in red armor burst into laughter. "Little guy, are you crazy? Do you just overrate yourself? You may be talented, but we have a lot of talented disciples. There is no lack of such outsiders like you in our clan. It's a good thing to be confident, but it's ridiculous to be arrogant!"</p>

  <p>The others present nodded in agreement. They all thought that Luo Zheng was wildly arrogant as well.</p>

  <p>They had lived for so many divine eras, but they had never seen such a reckless talent like him.</p>

  <p>The smile on Alfredo's face was completely gone now. Everyone was bound to dislike an arrogant person. "Maybe I was wrong. You don't belong to the two types of people I just mentioned. You're a conceited warrior," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's defense, he did know that his words would annoy them, but he didn't want to die. He wanted to have a chance to prove his worth. He believed that he was valuable enough for the Han Clan to protect him.</p>

  <p>Even if both Aleyna and Han Liusu might take actions, he didn't know if that would stop the Han Clan's decision.</p>

  <p>He could guess that the reason Alfredo wanted to see him was because he wanted to determine if he was worth it or not.</p>

  <p>Just then, a gentle voice rang throughout the hall and said, "I believe handing this young man over to the Xie Clan must be the stupidest thing for the Han Clan to do ever since the beginning of the divine era!"</p>

  <p>The owner of the voice was none other than Joy, the Demi-holy Being of the Han Clan. When her words had died down, she stepped fully inside the Spiritual Heart Hall. She glanced at Luo Zheng with a smile, and then said,</p>

  <p>"I wonder why you didn't go to the Arena of Legends today. Now, it turns out that you came here to rest. Come back with me right now."</p>
