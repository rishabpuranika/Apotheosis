  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Oh! Fren Zhuge!" Zheng nodded and repeated, "Is he the one who is usually called the Loony Fren?"</p>

  <p>Vivan grinned, "It seems that you have heard of my master's nickname..."</p>

  <p>"Just tell him to die," replied Zheng as he sneered at Vivan in disgust.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Vivan stood on the spot stiffly with a fixed grin. She had thought that Zheng would comply with her request after learning of her master's identity. She hadn't expected Zheng to refuse so firmly.</p>

  <p>Zheng dared to speak so haughtily, implying that he was not afraid of Fren at all.</p>

  <p>A hint of life vitality scattered out from Vivan's hair...</p>

  <p>Vivan's straight hair curled and surged like the waves of the sea. Then they rose in spirals to form five cones. In the next instant, they pointed at Zheng, like five spinning drilling bits. She threatened, "Anyone who has dared to offend my master has died. Do you want to die as well?"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled, pointed to the auction hall, and cautioned, "Huh, do you want to fight me now? You'd better take a look around and see where you are."</p>

  <p>The dispute in the room immediately drew the attention of the people in the auction house.</p>

  <p>Noticing the strange situation, a few guards of the Zhang Clan approached Zheng's room. Blessed Auction House was obliged to keep its customers safe, and fighting was absolutely prohibited in the auction house.</p>

  <p>Vivan glanced at the guards and recalled her life vitality. She snorted and turned to leave the room.</p>

  <p>Gazing at her receding figure, Zheng smirked and shouted, "Twenty-four thousand and one hundred!"</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's bid and seeing Vivan's livid face, Fren knew that Zheng had not taken his threat seriously.</p>

  <p>"What did the boy say?" asked Fren with a smile.</p>

  <p>Depressed, Vivan said, "He said you should go die!"</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" Fren didn't seem angry when he heard Vivian. He reached out with one hand, touched Vivan's face, and said, "How dare he speak like that? I haven't been in such a situation for a long time! In that case, I'll quit the bidding!"</p>

  <p>Vivan's eyes widened when she heard Fren. She asked, "Why do you quit, master? Are you afraid of that kid?"</p>

  <p>Fren shrugged and explained, "If I continue to bid, the older members from other noble clans might not keep out of the affair. If they own the Weapon Refining Principle, I will not be able to get it back. It's better to give up now. If the boy obtains the book, all I need to do is to grab it from him."</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Vivan's face as she understood Fren's scheme.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it would be impossible to take the Weapon Refining Principle from Zheng when he was in the Blessed Auction House. But Zheng would leave the auction house eventually and then, Fren would get his chance.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng was wearing the outer disciple robe of Cloud Sect, it would not be difficult to learn his identity either. It would be easier to snatch the book from Zheng at Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Since Fren stopped bidding, no one competed with Zheng for the Weapon Refining Principle, and Zheng won it eventually.</p>

  <p>However, according to the rules, Zheng must offer enough cubic crystals to take ownership of the Weapon Refining Principle. Since Zheng's crystal core of the fire scorpion lion had not been auctioned, he didn't have the crystals needed to complete the purchase.</p>

  <p>From the platform, Nestor announced, "Well, just now we had a little trouble with the Weapon Refining Principle. Anyway, we have sold it at a good price. We still have two treasures to auction. Initially, they were supposed to be the finales of the auction, but now, we have decided to sell them in advance! The floor price of these two objects is far higher than that of the Weapon Refining Principle. But I believe you will be very interested in them!"</p>

  <p>After Nestor finished speaking, he took out a small jade bottle.</p>

  <p>He shook the bottle with his right hand, and at the same time, a thread of life vitality came out from his left hand and floated to the mouth of the bottle.</p>

  <p>Then, a few small particles spread out from the mouth of the jade bottle, one drop after another, just like tiny droplets of water, but with a metallic luster.</p>

  <p>"Here are fifty drops of heavenly essence! The base price is twenty thousand cubic crystals. You can start bidding now!" Nestor waved his left hand, utilizing his life vitality to disperse the drops of heavenly essence in the air so that everyone in the auction house could see them clearly.</p>

  <p>"Wow!"</p>

  <p>The bidders' enthusiasm was aroused, and they began talking animatedly.</p>

  <p>When added to weapons, the heavenly essence would increase their grade by one level.</p>

  <p>For example, if the heavenly essence were added to a mid-grade spiritual weapon, it would be elevated to the top grade.</p>

  <p>However, heavenly essence was extremely rare, and so far, people did not know how to obtain it in larger quantities. Whenever heavenly essence appeared, the owners would add it into their weapons immediately.</p>

  <p>It was said that heavenly essence was the key base of all the mysterious, spiritual, and even fairy weapons!</p>

  <p>The reason why these weapons had tremendous power was that weapon refiners blended the weapons with a glimmer of Heavenly Law during the process of refining. Heavenly essence contained pure Heavenly Law in very high concentrations!</p>

  <p>It was rumored that even a low-grade mysterious weapon could have a little bit of heavenly essence, but so far, no one had been able to extract any.</p>

  <p>Zheng was stunned when he saw the heavenly essence. As the droplets danced in the air, shimmering under the light, his jaw dropped to the ground. His heart beat faster as he stared at the silver particles floating in the air.</p>

  <p>Weren't these tiny substances the same as the iron essence that was produced by the black fire that melted mysterious weapons?</p>
