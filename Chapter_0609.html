<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At the same time, in the easternmost area of the Central Region, there was a huge mountain range.</p>

  <p>The mountains seemed to stretch into the sky. The range was so high that it safeguarded the continent from the tsunami in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. Owing to the altitude of the range, all the peaks were covered in a thick layer of snow, some as deep as 100 feet! The range was called a dead zone as it was impossible for people to climb out if they accidentally fell into the snow.</p>

  <p>Even cultivators at the Illuminating Soul Realm dared not to go deep into the mountains even though they could fly. The snowstorm raging on the mountaintop was so fierce that the wind stung like knife blades. Besides, several unknown monsters, beasts, and terrifying creatures lived on the mountain range. Since these creatures could survive such harsh conditions, they were not easy to deal with.</p>

  <p>However, today, the snow on the highest mountain in the range had melted completely.</p>

  <p>The snow-covered peaks of the mountain range had been accumulating snow for thousands of years. Today, the snow on one peak had disappeared, revealing the black mountain that stood out in contrast to its nearby snow-capped peaks.</p>

  <p>A strong and bare-torso man panted on the mountaintop. A grey flame burned behind him. Beneath his feet, lay a snow flood dragon that was 500 feet in length.</p>

  <p>Snow flood dragons lived in the land of snow and ice. They were born fierce and powerful!</p>

  <p>The fierce snow flood dragon lay beneath the man's feet. Many parts of its huge body were burned.</p>

  <p>"Little Eddie! Didn't you say that you would take me to see the snow and eat a snow flood dragon's heart? You melted all the snow on the mountain. How do I see snow now?" A woman dressed in a fox-fur robe levitated in the air behind the strong man. She positioned herself such that it appeared as though she were lying on a bench beneath her.</p>

  <p>Her voice was so enchanting and sweet that people would be enraptured upon hearing her. What was more exciting was that she wore no other clothes except the fox-fur robe, which covered only her breasts and private parts. Other parts of her body were uncovered, and her skin was so fair that it was whiter than the snow.</p>

  <p>"Your seduction and complaints will not work. You wanted to see the snow, and I brought you here. You want to eat the snow flood dragon's heart��" The strapping man bent down and removed the heart of the dying snow flood dragon. Fierce creatures like the snow flood dragon had strong bodies. Though it had been seriously injured, the snow flood dragon's heart still beat vigorously.</p>

  <p>The woman was frightened when she saw the pulsating and bloody snow flood dragon's heart. "Oh! Little Eddie, there is so much blood. How will I eat it?"</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to bring a chef here?" The expression on the strapping man's face darkened.</p>

  <p>The enchanting woman floated to him slowly and wrapped her fair and thin arms around his neck and said, "Little Eddie, I did not mean that.</p>

  <p>But on the day you practice Lustful Demon Array, you must have three Purple Power Bodies' virginity energy�� I have been reserving my body for you for thirty years. If you cannot find the third Purple Power Body, am I supposed to wait another thirty years?"</p>

  <p>The strapping man suddenly grabbed the enchanting woman's hand, pulled her into his arms, and smiled flirtatiously. "Don't worry. Yan's talent is no less than yours. Breaking through the Internal Elixir Realm just needed one or two years. I already know of another Purple Power body. It won't take me long to find it, and then I can satisfy you. I will satisfy you well!"</p>

  <p>Then, the strapping man ran his fingers on the enchanting woman's body, leaving a trail of the snow flood dragon's blood on her skin. The frightened woman screamed.</p>

  <p>The strapping man was the Evil East Lord. And the enchanting woman's name was Marilyn Si.</p>

  <p>Marilyn was a Purple Power Body like Yan. She had been following Eddie for thirty years and had reserved her virginity till now for his Lustful Demon Array!</p>

  <p>Most women were unwilling to cultivate the Lustful Demon Array. In fact, the Lustful Demon Array was not an evil cultivation that would sacrifice a female to a male. It was a huge cultivation that would benefit both genders. So, the Lustful Demon Array was beneficial for both Eddie and Marilyn.</p>

  <p>When flirting with Marilyn, Eddie suddenly turned serious.</p>

  <p>"Little Eddie, what's the matter?" Marilyn asked with a sweet voice.</p>

  <p>Eddie sneered and said, "Interesting! Very interesting! I sense a hint of killing intent!"</p>

  <p>Eddie practiced a special cultivation method. Combined with his talent, the cultivation method could help him sense another person's intent to kill him!</p>

  <p>The Evil East Lord, who was famous in the Central Region, had been envied and hated by several people. Since he was not a god, he couldn't hear people's thoughts.</p>

  <p>However, he could sense their strong killing intent!</p>

  <p>Only an enemy determined to kill him could generate such a strong killing intent! It meant that the enemy despised him so much at this moment that the enemy must kill Eddie.</p>

  <p>Though he could sense the existence of the killing intent, Eddie could not locate the enemy.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Marilyn said with a puzzled look. "Who dares to challenge our little Eddie? Aren't they afraid of being identified, chased, and killed by little Eddie?"</p>

  <p>"Ahah," Eddie laughed. "The strange thing is that the enemy seems very weak. But why would someone hate me so much?" Eddie was confused.</p>

  <p>'The master of the killing intent seems powerless in comparison to me.</p>

  <p>But his willpower is so strong! Who could it be?'</p>

  <p>"Whatever. If your enemy isn't powerful, then there's no need to worry,"</p>

  <p>Marilyn chuckled and stretched out her hand, and daubed Eddie's face with the snow flood dragon's blood.</p>

  <p>Eddie appeared calm, but he didn't stop thinking about this mysterious enemy. He had sensed similar killing intent thousands of times during his life. Over time, many people had tried to kill him.</p>

  <p>Assassinating, killing, murdering�� They had used all kinds of means and failed. There had been no exceptions!</p>

  <p>Eddie was too lazy to deal with those whose killing intent was meaningless. There was even a time when he had to shut down this troublesome sensing ability. So many people had been eager to kill him that he always had this sense of foreboding. The stress of continually receiving warnings was grueling for Eddie. And while several people had actually dared to try, no one had succeeded.</p>

  <p>But today, the hint of killing intent from this mystery enemy had been so strong that it shook Eddie to the core. He was confused. While his enemy had strong killing intent, he was as weak as an ant. So why did Eddie feel a bit nervous?</p>

  <p>Eddie was cautious though he looked like an unwary man.</p>

  <p>If he could learn of his enemy's identity, he would probably kill this person. Unfortunately, he could only sense the killing intent, but not who it came from.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not know that the moment he decided to kill Eddie, his opponent could sense his killing will even though he was a hundred thousand miles away.</p>

  <p>And Luo Zheng had not even spoken the words out loud!</p>

  <p>His will of martial arts was always strong. But today, he knew how large the gap was between him and the Evil East Lord. And for a brief moment, Luo Zheng doubted himself.</p>

  <p>But he calmed down and reassured himself. Zheng's will of martial arts had now become stronger than before.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's confidence restored, Tianming and Patrick were very happy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng now needed to practice in Cloud Hall as he needed time to digest what he got from Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>Sitting cross-legged in the practice room, Luo Zheng rotated his hands like a wheel disc. The life vitality spun alongside his hands. As he rotated faster and faster, it became a whole circle.</p>

  <p>"The Malicious Wheel of Life and Death was the most powerful attack method for the Blood Fiend Emperor. Unexpectedly, it's not complicated to practice!"</p>

  <p>Looking at the rotating life vitality wheel, Luo Zheng smiled slightly. Though far from the first level� Exterminating Wheel� he had pretty much succeeded in giving it a proper shape.</p>

  <p>Cultivation methods concerning malicious Mu Ning had some advantages.</p>

  <p>They were easy to practice and more potent than other cultivation methods. Since it was a shortcut, countless people had been attracted to it. However, it did come with the risk of the cultivator being controlled and consumed by the malicious Mu Ning! But Luo Zheng, who had been to Killing Sword Mountain, did not have such a risk.</p>

  <p>"How about trying the power of the Exterminating Wheel?"</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Zheng extracted a piece of the malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The moment the blood red malicious Mu Ning was put into it, the malicious Mu Ning rushed to the practicing room with the rotation of the Exterminating Wheel.</p>

  <p>The malicious Mu Ning was so powerful that it broke through the floor of the practicing room, several layers of the wooden flooring, the thick rock layer, and then over 400 feet of floating stone before hitting the ground, a kilometer away.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, an alarm sounded outside the practicing room.</p>
