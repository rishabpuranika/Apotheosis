<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3003 Cultivating Two Truths Of Godly Ways </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Truths of Godly Ways were common in the Source World.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to decipher the meaning of the Sanskrit words that had been used to record the Truths of Godly Ways. However, once deciphered, the record would be extremely easy to replicate.</p>

  <p>Many versions of the translations of the Truths of Godly Ways existed. In addition to the versions of human language, the texts had also been transcribed in the languages of other races.</p>

  <p>The translations of the Truths of Godly Ways were easy to obtain, but few people could truly comprehend them.</p>

  <p>"There appears to be no difference between this translation and what we usually see," said Kenelm as he thumbed through the translation, his face plainly showing his disappointment.</p>

  <p>After staying at the Sword Dance Palace for so many days, the group had been looking forward to what they would get. To their disappointment, it was nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Godly Way is translated as a whole. You cannot add or subtract one word, as it is strictly prohibited. It only makes sense that there is no difference between this translation and what we usually see. The most important resource belonging to the Sword Light Palace is the Lofty Sword.</p>

  <p>If we could observe it from a short distance, the knowledge could be extremely helpful to us," another person opined.</p>

  <p>"You're right, Hyde. We joined the Sword Light Palace not because of this translation," Kenelm agreed. Then he looked over at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng leafed through the cyan book in his hand and recited the contents of a page under his breath, as if he couldn't wait to cultivate the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent recorded in the book.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, do you want to cultivate the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent? Haven't you already cultivated the Truth of Cultivation Nature?" asked Kenelm. A strange look passed across his face.</p>

  <p>Zheng's train of thought was interrupted by Kenelm's question. He smiled faintly and said, "Can't I? Is it not possible to cultivate two Truths of Godly Ways?"</p>

  <p>"It's not like that. What I meant was, since you have already practiced the Truth of Cultivation Nature, it would be too late and time-consuming for you to cultivate the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent too. Although the masters in the Sword Light Palace focus on the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, they also have the cultivation methods that correspond to the other Truths of Godly Ways."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and replied, "If cultivating one more Truth of Godly Way wouldn't pose any problems, then I don't intend to waste such an opportunity."</p>

  <p>While speaking, Zheng sighed inwardly.</p>

  <p>Complete translations of the Truths of Godly Ways were rare in the divine land. Even a Holy Being would be hard-pressed to find one. By contrast, these translations were popular goods of dependable quality in the Source World. The disparity was too great.</p>

  <p>The gap could be attributed to people in the divine land failing to impart and inherit the knowledge of the Nine Li race before the race was destroyed. Zheng's mother had retained a slight bias against the aboriginals of the divine land, so she was naturally unwilling to teach them the Truth of Godly Way that she had cultivated.</p>

  <p>"It is said that if one cultivates another Truth of Godly Way, their body can accommodate one more Other Shore Token. Zheng, I believe you can cultivate two Truths of Godly Ways." Hyde, a consummate True God, complimented Zheng.</p>

  <p>These ten people had witnessed with their own eyes how Zheng easily beat more than thirty disciples from the Sword Dance Palace. In their eyes, Zheng was so powerful that they had subconsciously regarded him as their leader.</p>

  <p>"I'm flattered, Hyde. The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent is very complicated.</p>

  <p>I fear that it will take me a long time to— "</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could finish his words, an extremely sharp aura streamed through the walls of the Sword Dance Palace and headed straight to the backyard.</p>

  <p>Like a substance that could pierce through people's hearts, the tip of the aura induced shivers in their group of ten people, including Kenelm. Their eyes betrayed their fear.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows twitched as he felt the aura.</p>

  <p>He recognized it as an aura produced by the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>It was strong, long lasting, and sharp.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the sound of messy footsteps, more than thirty people rushed in through the backyard gate. They were the disciples whom Zheng had beaten.</p>

  <p>'They come at last, ' Zheng thought to himself. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.</p>

  <p>He knew exactly what these disciples were like. If they didn't yield, they would do everything to mobilize all of their resources to fight back.</p>

  <p>They had never suffered this kind of grievance before.</p>

  <p>After rushing into the backyard, all of them stared at Zheng viciously.</p>

  <p>If looks could kill, Zheng would have died for hundreds of thousands of times already.</p>

  <p>"Chadwick, it's him!" Faegan said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Let's get rid of him together," said Jago, stroking his silver forelock.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a strange voice resounded from the crowd. "He has only recently entered the Sea of Truth, hasn't he? He is a nobody who has barely passed the first line, and yet you ask me here to fight against him together.</p>

  <p>Are you looking down on me?"</p>

  <p>Then, a man stepped out of the crowd. He was eight feet tall, thin as a bamboo pole and just as frail-looking, but he exuded a strong aura. When he exerted all his strength, it seemed as if he himself was a sharp sword.</p>

  <p>It was Chadwick, a talent from the Qiu Clan whom they had paid a lot of money to invite.</p>

  <p>There was no obstacle in the backyard, and the aura released by Chadwick was even sharper. When Kenelm and the other nine people faced it, they felt increasingly uncomfortable, and their faces were all as pale as a ghost.</p>

  <p>However, Kenelm plucked up his courage and stammered, "This is the Sword Dance Palace. According to the rules, only the disciples in the Sword Dance Palace can fight with each other. As a member of another palace, I'm afraid it will be against the rules for you to fight against us."</p>

  <p>Worrying about the retaliation from those disciples, Kenelm had learned the rules of the Sword Dance Palace in recent days.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>The disciples burst into laughter upon hearing his words.</p>

  <p>"Look at these losers! They just arrived here a few days ago, but now they are explaining the rules to us!" Faegan said with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"They are so funny. They don't know that Ingram pays no attention to the Sword Dance Palace at all. The rules of the Sword Dance Palace are set by us." Jago also laughed hysterically.</p>

  <p>Among the thirteen palaces under the jurisdiction of the Sword Light Palace, the Sword Dance Palace had the most lax of rules. Disciples in other palaces were not allowed to battle at will.</p>

  <p>These disciples had set up the rules of the Sword Dance Palace in order to drive away the disciples who joined the palace after them.</p>

  <p>Kenelm and his friends looked at each other, deeply concerned. Zheng, however, was not the least bit worried about it.</p>

  <p>Zheng tilted his head and stared at Faegan. "Even if the rules were laid down by you, they are still the rules of the Sword Dance Palace. Isn't it against them to have an outsider fight for you?"</p>

  <p>"It's a pity. I'm a disciple of the Sword Dance Palace," Chadwick said flatly.</p>

  <p>Faegan also mocked, "Only losers like you will follow the rules and try to avoid getting caught. It's a pity, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head without any expression. "If he were not a disciple of the Sword Dance Palace, I would be breaking the rules. Now that he has identified himself as a disciple of the Sword Dance Palace, then I won't be breaking the rules. I'm relieved to hear that."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Chadwick's eyes slightly narrowed.</p>

  <p>With a bang, the ground that had just been repaired was suddenly ripped wide open into a massive hole. Zheng transformed into a remnant figure, cutting a path at an unimaginable speed and coming straight toward Chadwick.</p>

  <p>With his cultivation base, Chadwick could undisputedly rank first in the Sword Dance Palace. However, like the other disciples in the Sword Dance Palace, he had little experience in actual combat. He had never thought that Zheng would suddenly launch an attack.</p>

  <p>When Zheng reached him, Chadwick had already pulled his cyan sword out of its sheath. Then, a crisp sound rang, and before anyone could blink, his one arm was swinging down uselessly to his side.</p>
