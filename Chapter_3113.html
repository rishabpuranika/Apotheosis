<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Flag Master! You're alright!" Gant was so excited to see Luo Zheng safe and sound that he almost jumped out of his skin.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged and replied, "Of course I'm fine."</p>

  <p>"But your body is golden all over," Gant said, looking at Luo Zheng's corporeal body.</p>

  <p>These weapon refiners were very insightful and noticed the strangeness of Luo Zheng's body right off the bat.</p>

  <p>When one refined a weapon using the Fire Quenching Method, the weapon needed to absorb all the flames surrounding it. Luo Zheng's situation was similar to a weapon refined using the Fire Quenching Method.</p>

  <p>But there were also a few unique body refining methods in the Source World; merging one's body with metal, for example. And these weapon refiners were speculating whether or not Luo Zheng had practiced this method.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. The golden light will dissipate," Luo Zheng said as he looked at the winged woman through the array. "Now that we are here in the array, it's time to think about how to fight that woman."</p>

  <p>The woman continued to accumulate power, her entire body dazzling like sun.</p>

  <p>Cailen could feel the immense power radiating from the woman. He said to his son, "You are responsible for the last position of the array!"</p>

  <p>He had barely finished speaking when the array plate in his hand trembled and turned, a beam of green light enveloping Luo Zheng and Gant. Gant nodded and drew his sword.</p>

  <p>The other weapon refiners' eyes widened as they saw the sword in Gant's hand. They looked reproachfully at Cailen.</p>

  <p>The sword in Gant's sword was too ordinary and couldn't even be considered a primary Profound Blood Treasure.</p>

  <p>After all, he was the son of the Su Clan's head. How could he be so poor?</p>

  <p>Cailen looked around awkwardly.</p>

  <p>The Su Clan was not poor. Cailen just wanted to teach his son a lesson, which was why he had taken away everything from Gant before the latter had left the clan. Cailen hadn't left even a single piece of divine crystal to him.</p>

  <p>"Gant, take the sword!"</p>

  <p>Cailen waved a hand and a black sword shot towards Gant.</p>

  <p>The sword was a premium Profound Blood Treasure.</p>

  <p>"What?" Gant exclaimed, shocked. "Father, why are you giving me this sword?"</p>

  <p>This sword was called the Moon Chasing Sword. A premium Profound Blood Treasure was nothing to the Su Clan. The Moon Chasing Sword, however, was an inherited sword within the clan.</p>

  <p>Possessing this sword meant that Gant was the heir of the Su Clan.</p>

  <p>Cailen had handed the Moon Chasing Sword to his son. He wouldn't abdicate and let his son become the head of the Su Clan now. But it showed that he thought highly of his son.</p>

  <p>After all, the conflict between father and son had something to do with the Dragon City. Gant had chased Eira all the way here.</p>

  <p>And now in this critical moment, he would also play an important role in dealing with the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>As another green light column rose, the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array absorbed the power of the Moon Chasing Sword as well.</p>

  <p>The whole array aligned into its most perfect formation at this moment.</p>

  <p>The green light solidified and became powerful, almost to the point of abnormality.</p>

  <p>The woman stretched her broad wings, the air around her continuing to tremble.</p>

  <p>She gently stroked the air with her soft hands.</p>

  <p>A small golden ball appeared out of nowhere. And as her hands continued to stroke it, the ball rose like the morning sun. The light around the ball continued to glow brighter and brighter.</p>

  <p>It caused the people to shut their eyes against its brilliance.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face hardened as he felt the power of the golden ball. The force contained in the ball was probably as powerful as a thousand divine megatons.</p>

  <p>Cailen felt the same way. His expression shifted as he continued to adjust the array plate with one hand. He turned to the other eight people and said,</p>

  <p>"Take out your Other Shore Tokens!"</p>

  <p>The Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array would absorb the power of their treasures. But Cailen was asking everyone to bring out their Other Shore Tokens so that they could maximize the power of the array. Just to be safe.</p>

  <p>"Ordering Fire!"</p>

  <p>"Scorching Sun Stone!"</p>

  <p>Everyone activated their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>After the weapon refiners entered the Other Shore, they would usually look for the Other Shore Tokens suitable for weapon refining.</p>

  <p>These weapon refiners had quite strong cultivation bases. Once they activated their Other Shore Tokens, a steady flow of Other Shore Power was sent into the array, causing the array's cumulative power to increase by leaps and bounds.</p>

  <p>The only weakness in the array was Gant. His Other Shore Token was ordinary, and the power he contributed to the array was limited.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood within the array, unmoving.</p>

  <p>His demonic eye could contribute a lot of power to the array, but the array could only absorb the power of the warriors who were standing within the nine positions. Luo Zheng was not one of them.</p>

  <p>And he didn't want to activate his demonic eye in front of all these people.</p>

  <p>They had just prepared themselves when the woman threw the sun-like ball at them.</p>

  <p>The energy within the light ball was condensed to the point where it felt like the light ball was a tangible thing.</p>

  <p>Cailen turned the array plate in his hand. The green light then turned into nine cubes, which rose in the air before connecting with each other and turning into a giant turtle shell over everyone's head.</p>

  <p>"Array transformation! Nine-Cube Black Armor!"</p>

  <p>The little golden ball landed on the shell.</p>

  <p>BAM!</p>

  <p>The tiny golden ball bounced on the surface of the turtle shell for a while and then suddenly shattered.</p>

  <p>The divine flames, that could burn almost everything, were released from the shattered ball. They turned into a beautiful flower, which was too dazzling to be seen by the naked eye.</p>

  <p>Through the layer of the turtle shell, everyone could see the golden flames stirring and circulating in the air.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A tiny crack appeared on the surface of the turtle shell.</p>

  <p>The moment Cailen saw the crack, he hurried to twist the array plate, repairing the crack in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>But a second crack appeared immediately after the first one was repaired.</p>

  <p>Eight repairs later, the divine flames finally burned out. They had successfully blocked this round of attack from the woman.</p>

  <p>The woman frowned at this.</p>

  <p>The Scorching Sun Attack was one of her most powerful skills. But mere inconspicuous weapon refiners had managed to block it, something she hadn't expected at all.</p>

  <p>"I'm dumbfounded that you've resisted my attack, given your current cultivation levels. But can you resist my second attack? How about the third one?"</p>

  <p>She stretched out her hands and gently stroked the air, causing another golden ball to form in midair.</p>

  <p>The weapon refiners had limited power. If they kept activating the array, it would consume all the Other Shore Power of their Other Shore Tokens, and would also consume all of their truth aura. In the end, the entire array would collapse.</p>

  <p>But they had no choice other than to take the woman's full-blown attacks head-on.</p>

  <p>She threw the second ball, causing more and more cracks to appear on the turtle shell. She was right when she told them that the array would break if she attacked a few more times.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>If this went on, all of them would eventually die in the woman's hands.</p>

  <p>Cailen had used all his strength to protect the turtle shell from the woman's second attack.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to hold on the third time. The woman, on the other hand, didn't look tired at all. It looked like releasing the golden ball was a piece of cake for her. Luo Zheng felt he had to do something.</p>
