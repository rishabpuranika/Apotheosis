<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 217 The Power Of Zheng's Fist (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth at the thought and was ready to bet all on a single blow. He stretched out his arm and motioned for the black fire to go into the runes on his arm.</p>

  <p>As a result of his intensive training, the black fire could now easily recognize the runes in Zheng's arm and would instantly dive into them.</p>

  <p>As soon as the runes absorbed the black fire, Zheng's arm trembled a little.</p>

  <p>The extreme power of the black fire emitted heat and Luo Zheng could feel the warm sensation crawling from his arm.</p>

  <p>Though the heat was overwhelming, Luo Zheng only felt relief rather than pain.</p>

  <p>In no time, the runes started to rotate. When the inner and outer parts moved, the center of runes flashed a bright light.</p>

  <p>As the runes began their ritual, Luo Zheng grabbed the phoenix crystal with his left hand and stuffed it in the center of the runes.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>As soon as the phoenix crystal touched the runes, a blinding light sparked but runes stopped rotation and returned to normal. The phoenix crystal suddenly vanished.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stupefied and touched the spot where the phoenix crystal was.</p>

  <p>He pressed it and felt something hard beneath his skin. He assumed it was the phoenix crystal embedded into his skin.</p>

  <p>After the black fire finally came out of the runes, Luo Zheng stood up and tried to move his right arm.</p>

  <p>"It's time to test the phoenix crystal! Let's see how this can improve my speed!" In this room, all the facilities that Luo Zheng needed for his training were available and soon he found a stone man to practice boxing with.</p>

  <p>Standing in front of the stone man, Luo Zheng squared his elbows and took a deep breath. Then he swiftly shook his fist at the stone man.</p>

  <p>"Bang bang bang bang bang�"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Luo Zheng threw twenty punches in a row and left marks on the stone man.</p>

  <p>When he finally stopped, Zheng's right hand trembled. He was surprised to see the agility of his right hand.</p>

  <p>During his fight with a demon king, Luo Zheng had almost got killed. He realized that speed was a crucial element when fighting with masters if one wished to survive. That was why he chose the phoenix crystal to make up for his shortcomings.</p>

  <p>Now that the phoenix crystal was on its place, Luo Zheng had only one crystal slot left to fill. He looked at his spear and examined the remaining crystal attached to it � the emerald crystal. According to Spencer, the emerald crystal had the special ability to destroy any enchanted barrier. The fact was that Zheng's current strength could do nothing to enchanted barriers, and he wouldn't miss the chance to utilize the emerald crystal.</p>

  <p>The method was the same. He carefully took it out from the spear and stuffed it onto his arm.</p>

  <p>But unlike with the phoenix crystal, Luo Zheng felt nothing special after the crystal was embedded into his skin. Perhaps it was because of the nature of the emerald crystal that it could only be used to destroy any enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>After the two crystals were finally embedded into his skin, he returned to his secluded corner to rest.</p>

  <p>The soldiers of the White Emperor City had been quite busy these days with rebuilding the defense facilities, and inspection on all the people of the city.</p>

  <p>The inspection was necessary to ensure that no demon general could walk among the people of the White Emperor City because the demon generals could devour a human body without leaving any marks, and they could use the skin as their disguise.</p>

  <p>"Bang bang bang!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heard a loud knock on his door.</p>

  <p>When he opened the door, he saw several soldiers holding a demon-revealing mirror.</p>

  <p>The head of the soldier group greeted Luo Zheng respectfully. Although he knew nothing about Luo Zheng or his achievements, he believed that anyone who was qualified to live in the area must be an important figure of the imperial army.</p>

  <p>"Sir, we are currently doing an inspection in the whole city. May we request you to stand here?" the soldier said to Luo Zheng as he formally bowed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and cooperatively stood aside. Then several soldiers placed the demon-revealing mirror in front of Luo Zheng and when his image was finally reflected in the mirror, the soldiers took it back.</p>

  <p>When everything was cleared, the head of the soldiers thanked Luo Zheng for his cooperation and left. They went to the next room where Yolande was staying.</p>

  <p>The soldiers knocked on the door, but there was no response.</p>

  <p>The head of the soldiers ordered, "Keep knocking. There must be someone inside."</p>

  <p>After a few attempts, the door finally opened and the soldiers were greeted by the expressionless face of Yolande. "What's up?" Yolande asked.</p>

  <p>The soldiers were surprised to see Yolande. Unlike Luo Zheng, Yolande was well-known amongst the soldiers and her name held a great reputation in the city. The head of the soldiers stuttered, "Officer Yolande, we apologize for this unannounced visit, but we are currently doing an inspection in the whole city. We know you very well, but we have to follow protocol. We hope you can do us a favor and cooperate with us."</p>

  <p>Clad in her usual nine-color long dress and a pair of clogs on her feet, Yolande stood at the gate and asked in a calm manner, "What is this inspection about? And why should I go through this inspection again?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Because demon generals might be lurking here, and we are using the demon-revealing mirror to find them," the head of the soldiers told all the details to Yolande. Being known as the Killer Girl, Yolande was not someone these soldiers would trifle with. Although her facial expression was blank, she still looked intimidating and her Mu Ning sent shivers down the soldiers' spine.</p>

  <p>"There's no way I am possessed by any demon general, so I don't need this silly inspection. Off you go then." Yolande was about to go back to her room when she heard a soldier speak.</p>
