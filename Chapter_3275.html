<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng had already obtained a great deal of soul crystal, so the willow did not interest him at all.</p>

  <p>They went down the steps and crossed the path through the middle of the courtyard.</p>

  <p>There were other Souls of Light sucking the willow essence and looking for the Other Shore Tokens in the courtyard. They all focused their eyes on Zheng as he walked by.</p>

  <p>They had spent one million soul pills to enter the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>For that price, just a little walk in the courtyard was definitely not enough.</p>

  <p>Most Souls of Light were waiting here, although some had already crossed the courtyard to look for the way leading to the Dark Region themselves.</p>

  <p>The further end of the temple was incredibly dangerous. They'd be dancing with death if they attempted to explore it blindly, without any assistance.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice had opened the door to the Grand Sky Temple and it seemed as though Zheng had some sort of deal with them. Believing they must have concocted some great plan, most of them had stayed back to follow behind them.</p>

  <p>And so, when they passed through the courtyard, everyone sucking the willow essence and searching for Other Shore Tokens stopped what they were doing and shuffled closer to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng paid them no mind and let them follow on, but the Ear Mice were quite displeased.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>"Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice did not want to go along with these Souls of Light of other races, so they had opted to enter the Grand Sky Temple last.</p>

  <p>They hadn't expected the Souls of Light to be so lazy and incompetent.</p>

  <p>They had no plan to search for the treasures themselves. All they wanted was to follow them and reap the rewards of their labor.</p>

  <p>One of the Ear Mice turned and yelled back at the Souls of Light with annoyance, "Squeak!</p>

  <p>Don't follow us!"</p>

  <p>Outside the Grand Sky Temple, the Ear Mice had the final say.</p>

  <p>After all, they had opened the door and set powerful restrictions.</p>

  <p>But inside the temple, the other races gave them no respect.</p>

  <p>"Hey, mice, you need to remember one thing; we have paid the soul pills!"</p>

  <p>"The temple is not yours. You just opened the door. I can go wherever I please and I am not following you!"</p>

  <p>"That's right! It just so happens we're heading in the same direction!"</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light of the other races spoke out one after another. Their shameless words left the Ear Mice speechless and with no choice but to turn to Zheng for help. "Tianxing, could you drive all these people away?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was the only one they could count on in the Grand Sky Temple.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head and laughed. "They have a point. I mean, they did pay one million soul pills."</p>

  <p>"Squeak!"</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice steamed in frustration. If they had known it would be this way, they would not have sold the tickets and Zheng would have only taken them to the temple.</p>

  <p>They might have earned a lot of soul pills, but entering the Dark Region was far more important.</p>

  <p>Now they were stuck with these Souls of Light following them whether they liked it or not.</p>

  <p>There were six paths in the back of the courtyard, which led to the six towers behind the Grand Sky Temple. The towers were clearly visible from outside the temple.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice asked Zheng to take the leftmost path. After a short while, they entered a tower.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light of the other races followed them closely.</p>

  <p>The six towers behind the Grand Sky Temple were known as the six treasures.</p>

  <p>Each tower had twenty-nine floors. The higher the floor, the more challenging it would prove.</p>

  <p>Once they had entered the tower, an Ear Mouse explained to Zheng, "So far, no one has been able to climb to the top of the tower. Squeak!"</p>

  <p>"There must be a sixth-grade Other Shore Token at the top!"</p>

  <p>"I made it to the 16th floor before I could take no more. I obtained a fifth-grade Other Shore Token there!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God, you have been to the 16th floor? That's amazing!"</p>

  <p>The other races chimed in while the Ear Mouse spoke earnestly to Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse turned its head irritated and said, "You know, there are some truly wonderful treasures at the top of the tower. Don't let this opportunity pass. Go up there and obtain all the incredible rewards!"</p>

  <p>"I'll explore the tower next time, ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>"My Soul of Light is not in a good condition, so I can't go up there."</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light of the other races were set on following Zheng. The Ear Mouse's tricks would not change their minds.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice shook their heads and began chattering among themselves. It seemed as if they knew there was no getting rid of them and they'd have to take some other course of action.</p>

  <p>One of the Ear Mice walked up to the edge of the tower. It raised its tail and turned it into a flat blade. The Ear Mouse then cut a small square into the ground using its tail blade.</p>

  <p>Stabbing its tail into the square, it lifted up a small door that covered a passageway leading downward.</p>

  <p>"There is a door here!"</p>

  <p>"Does it lead to the underground?"</p>

  <p>"I've been wondering all this time how one would get to that section behind the temple. I never imagined it was hidden inside the first tower!"</p>

  <p>This secret belonged only to the Ear Mice. Understandably, the other races were astonished by this discovery.</p>

  <p>With the small door lifted, a passageway revealed itself.</p>

  <p>The others didn't rush in. Instead, they looked on quietly as Zheng, Dorothy, and the Ear Mice entered one by one.</p>

  <p>As soon as they had gone through, everyone else rushed in chaotically, even fighting their way through if they had to.</p>

  <p>Zheng could only shake his head when he heard the ruckus coming from behind him.</p>

  <p>The underground passageway was not long, only over a thousand feet. At the end of it was a basement where a row of large oddly shaped stones were placed.</p>

  <p>The stones were all very smooth, except for some oval hollows in the center. It seemed as though something had once been embedded in the sunken parts, but they were no longer here.</p>

  <p>Zheng and his group arrived at the basement, followed shortly after by over one thousand Souls of Light of the other races.</p>

  <p>The basement would have been spacious were it not for the more than a thousand creatures crowding it.</p>

  <p>One of the Ear Mice said to Zheng, "Squeak! It is this wall! If you break this wall, we can enter the Dark Region!"</p>

  <p>Hearing 'the Dark Region' excited everyone. This was what they had come for.</p>

  <p>"It is this wall," Zheng repeated.</p>

  <p>He walked up to the wall and gently scratched the surface. The wall began to glow with a metallic luster.</p>

  <p>The material of the wall was similar to that of the Grand Sky Temple. That would mean it should be made of some sort of mixed metal.</p>

  <p>Zheng tapped the wall lightly and a crisp echo rang throughout the basement.</p>

  <p>From that sound it was clear the Ear Mice had not lied; the wall was indeed very thin.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Facing the wall, Zheng took a step back and gathered power within his hand.</p>

  <p>He clenched it into a fist and unleashed a heavy blow to the wall.</p>
