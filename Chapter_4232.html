<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Godly Way energy that was rising out from his fingertips danced around in the air before slowly merging into a delicate ring.</p>

  <p>"What kind of bloodline do you have, Master Duran?" the Evil God asked.</p>

  <p>Duran understood what the Evil God wanted to do. He gently flapped his left wing, and a brilliant light flew out from the edges of his sharp feathers. The bloodline he possessed was of a mixed kind. It had the abilities of space-time and life quadrants. Theoretically, the fusion of just three bloodline abilities wasn't much impressive, but it was still quite useful. In fact, Duran was the only one in the Four Spirits Sect who had managed to master this fusion.</p>

  <p>The Evil God glanced at Duran's wings and in response, ten wisps of Godly Way energy rose out from his fingertips as well. They also started to merge into the ring. The whole process was being done very skillfully, and the dexterity here was definitely worth witnessing.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The ring trembled slightly, and a strand of brilliant light began flowing around it.</p>

  <p>"You possess a bloodline theurgy concerning bodily movement skill. It's very useful," the Evil God commented.</p>

  <p>Duran's body froze when he saw the familiar brilliance of the light.</p>

  <p>The blended bloodline he possessed was exclusive to the Four Spirits Sect, or more precisely, exclusive to him. But the Evil God had managed to master it with just a few glances!</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Is... this how you restore the bloodline powers?" The Grandmaster of Heaven was visibly excited at the prospect of witnessing something new.</p>

  <p>"How are you able to do it so skillfully?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God calmly infused more Godly Way energy into the ring, and the bloodline power inside it continued to change. He replied indifferently,</p>

  <p>"I restore the Godly Way energy to the bloodline powers. It is something I've practiced millions of times, and therefore, comes naturally to me. It's a piece of cake. The difficult task is restoring them to a higher level of power, by which I mean the power of the Deep Space that Duran mentioned..."</p>

  <p>After saying that, the Evil God raised up his hand and pointed towards the side of the ship.</p>

  <p>In the huge square that lay in the distance, tens of thousands of avatars of the Evil God were busy doing their jobs.</p>

  <p>When the first avatar had proposed the concept of restoring, it had attracted the attention of the Evil God. As a rather sensitive person, he had immediately asked all of his avatars to drop whatever they were doing and focus solely on studying possible methods of restoration.</p>

  <p>In order to speed up the task, the Evil God had also been creating more and more avatars to divide and conquer. Very soon, three of the avatars had managed to discover the secrets of the restoration and isolated a unique kind of bloodline power.</p>

  <p>Although things had been difficult at the beginning, after the first step, they had started becoming simpler.</p>

  <p>Soon after that, they had got their hands on the second, the third, and the fourth bloodline powers.</p>

  <p>"You, can restore all the bloodline powers?" Duran asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there are three hundred and seventy-three kinds, and I can get my hands on all of them." The Evil God was continuously infusing the Godly Way energy into the ring, and now, a new bloodline power was formed from the ring. It was releasing layers of diamond-shaped sources of light.</p>

  <p>When Duran saw these diamond-shaped flashes, there was a glint of something in his eyes, something that looked a lot like fury. He was feeling greatly threatened!</p>

  <p>As long as the diamond-shaped flashes of light continued to shoot out, there was no possible way for him to escape. He coldly spoke up, "This bloodline power..."</p>

  <p>"It can completely restrain your bloodline theurgy, but please don't take this the wrong way. I'm just demonstrating my capabilities." The Evil God clapped his hands. The ring dissipated, and the bloodline power also disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>"Directly restoring the three thousand Godly Ways to all three hundred and seventy-three bloodline powers ..." Duran muttered. "I cannot believe there is a genius who thought of that! I would have considered it impossible were I not seeing it with my own eyes."</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the warriors of the Four Spirits Sect had to kneel down in front of the ancestry-level bloodline to beg so that it would bestow upon them, its power.</p>

  <p>Those who had been able to obtain even a single one of the various energies had already progressed and were now outstanding warriors of the Four Spirits Sect. If they managed to fuse several unique bloodline powers at the same time, they would become one of the elites of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>The four kings had been racking their brains to find or obtain the full abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline. However, they hadn't succeeded and then, the Four Spirits Sect had been destroyed. They could now, only look at the ancestry-level bloodline with regret. However, this Evil God had used the three thousand Godly Ways to restore the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>But how could there be such a thing in the world?</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven had proclaimed himself to be one of the most powerful warriors of the Nihility race, and he was also one of the most intelligent people from the human race. Now that he was standing in front of the Evil God, even he suddenly felt a sense of inferiority. He was facing someone whose intelligence was beyond even his imagination.</p>

  <p>The Evil God himself paid no attention to Duran's shocked expression, and continued nonchalantly, "The power of the Deep Space is a level higher than that of the main world. It exists in various 'extreme forms'."</p>

  <p>"Extreme forms?" The Grandmaster of Heaven was confused.</p>

  <p>"You won't be able to understand that." The Evil God chose not to explain it and refused directly. This was something that even Duran, who hailed from a fourth-grade world couldn't understand, much less the Grandmaster of Heaven who was from a third-grade world. "In short, the energy ball I released before was a kind of destructive form. At the moment, I can only get this form through restoration. According to my estimate, there are over a hundred different extreme forms in the Deep Space. That number is about half that of the bloodline powers."</p>

  <p>The higher grade a world was, the less kinds of energy there would be inside it, and the more difficult it would be to find or create them through restoration.</p>

  <p>Compared to the bloodline power, the power of extreme forms in the Deep Space was extremely difficult to obtain, even for the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"That's all well and good, but with only this kind of power on your side, I'm afraid you are no match for the downgrader." Duran quickly calmed down. "Through his sword, the downgrader can use various kinds of powers of the Deep Space, or as you just said, various 'extreme forms'."</p>

  <p>"Give me enough time, and I will be able to do it," the Evil God replied.</p>

  <p>With his extraordinary talent, he could obtain more extreme forms by learning from his previously successful experiences. After obtaining the first "extreme form" in the Deep Space, the difficulties he had met before could be easily solved. "Moreover, I've already touched the power that is a level higher than that of the Deep Space."</p>

  <p>Hearing that, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran couldn't help but exchange a gaze.</p>

  <p>Shera, who was standing beside them was also puzzled. She had only felt that the power of the Evil God was beyond her imagination, as he had easily suppressed the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran.</p>

  <p>And right now, she was even more confused. What was the guy talking about? Did he just say that the power of the Deep Space was not the strongest?</p>

  <p>"Yes there is a higher level of power, and no, it is not also 'extreme form'," the Evil God continued to explain. "It's called the Field. All powers exist in the form of Field."</p>

  <p>Both Duran and the Grandmaster of Heaven had nothing to say now. What the Evil God was talking about was beyond their comprehension and they didn't know what they should ask.</p>

  <p>In the primitive land, the Snake Goddess, and the others were still under the bloody sky. They didn't know what was happening on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The fact that Zheng hadn't returned yet made them uneasy but there was nothing they could do.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess tried calling for the ancestry-level bloodline. In theory, the bloodline should know the situation of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>However, the ancestry-level bloodline didn't respond to her and the others at all. It was as if the bloodline was gone. Thus, Fuxi sat down cross legged and decided to take a risk and enter the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The moment he entered the Other Shore, his body fell down rapidly. He should have landed in the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>After he finally managed to stabilize himself, he looked around and was stunned. His face looked like he had been struck by lightning.</p>

  <p>"The... the Night View Island... The Jade Pure Realm... They're all gone..."</p>

  <p>There was only some debris around Fuxi, and the big and small Pure Sky Platforms had completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>When he withdrew from the Other Shore, his face had darkened severely.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others asked him what was happening, Fuxi shook his head and told them, "You can go there and see for yourselves. I don't know what or how to say."</p>

  <p>Thus, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others hurried towards the Other Shore. What they saw was a complete void with only debris lying around.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi was as flustered as Fuxi was when he saw this.</p>

  <p>"The whole Jade Pure Realm is just gone?!"</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the Snake Goddess calmed down quickly.</p>

  <p>"Zheng should be fine."</p>

  <p>If something had happened to him, the primitive land would not have been so calm.</p>
