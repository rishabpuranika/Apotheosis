<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2725 Samuel's Secret </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Gregorio and Nicholas were sworn enemies.</p>

  <p>Zheng understood the grudge as he learned that Nicholas was the person behind the whole Yue Clan's destruction. Zheng could feel the hatred emitted from the depth of Gregorio's soul in his Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>It was not only the Yue Clan that was destroyed, but even their Floating Island was involved. It also fell into the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Gregorio died but had gradually found a way to be successfully reincarnated. He learned about the Stone Mouse and relied on it to gain life.</p>

  <p>As he took a second chance to live, he dare not use his former name. He changed his name into Samuel Han.</p>

  <p>Nicholas on the other hand had always been watchful and cautious, but some things were certainly inevitable. He couldn't have imagined that Samuel was the reincarnation of Gregorio!</p>

  <p>'But the Stone Mouse has said that besides Gregorio, there are three other people who have been reincarnated. Who are they?' Zheng thought and pondered.</p>

  <p>The Jade Scale Butterfly and the Flame Blood Vulture had never appeared and the only one who could be reincarnated endless times in the divine land was Samuel.</p>

  <p>So were the other three people someone Samuel knew? Did they get reincarnated with the help of Samuel?</p>

  <p>To get a deeper understanding, Zheng once again looked at the sea of Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>The Memory Flames of the creatures in the divine land appeared simultaneously when their memories were formed and were stored there.</p>

  <p>Normally, he should be able to find the Memory Flame of Samuel.</p>

  <p>Through searching his memory, he should be able to know the answer.</p>

  <p>Zheng closed his eyes and continued to search using the Reincarnation Soul Weapon.</p>

  <p>After some time of searching, he opened his eyes with a trace of doubt on his face. "Why can't I find Samuel's Memory Flame?"</p>

  <p>Since Samuel had the Stone Mouse, he might have done some trick.</p>

  <p>At the thought of this, Zheng went back to the altar. He took out the Stone Mouse's corpse, and threw it back to the altar.</p>

  <p>He watched as the corpse came back to life again.</p>

  <p>"Squeak squeak squeak... You said you would not kill me!" The Stone Mouse cried out with a pitiful look on its face.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at it coldly and said, "I knew Gregorio's true identity."</p>

  <p>When the Stone Mouse heard Zheng's words, its bean sized eyes widened as it stared at him. It asked in a panic, "How, how did you know that?"</p>

  <p>It thought for a while, then a hint of panic appeared in its eyes, "Have you passed the test?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I have," Zheng responded with a smile.</p>

  <p>"It's... it's impossible. Only my master has the qualification, you You are not qualified!" the Stone Mouse screamed in disbelief.</p>

  <p>It had grown deep feelings of attachment to Gregorio, its master.</p>

  <p>According to the rule, the theurgy of Stone Mouse could only be used by itself, but it rebelled and did not follow that rule. Instead, it even used some secret method to integrate its own theurgy with Gregorio.</p>

  <p>As a result, Gregorio could directly search the Memory Flames without the use of the Reincarnation Soul Weapon.</p>

  <p>Of course...</p>

  <p>Even the Stone Mouse itself couldn't search the Memory Flames freely like Zheng could do. Thus, Gregorio could not randomly search the Memory Flames of any people he wanted.</p>

  <p>"If I am not qualified, then Gregorio is even more unqualified," Zheng said coldly. "He is not a Nine Li member, so how could he have the pure Chiyou's blood?"</p>

  <p>"Pure Chiyou's blood! My master said that he would bring it when he came to the Reincarnation Land again!" the Stone Mouse cried out in frustration.</p>

  <p>Perhaps because the Stone Mouse was exasperated, it lost its head and in rage it pounced on Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, its current cultivation was only at the Spirit Transformation Realm. It was not even a proving godly warrior. With a light pinch from Zheng, it was unable to move.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows furrowed at the words.</p>

  <p>He thought back and realized that he had never been close to Samuel.</p>

  <p>But he noticed that this Holy Being had tried to get close to Nicholas, almost at all costs.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, besides Zheng who had Chiyou's blood, his mother also had it.</p>

  <p>Harold had once informed him that his mother, Lorena was likely to have fallen into the hands of Nicholas. Would Samuel target his mother?</p>

  <p>Zheng felt that it was even more necessary for him to go on investigating.</p>

  <p>"Who are the other three people that have been reincarnated?" Zheng continued to ask.</p>

  <p>"I won't tell you. If you have the ability, just kill me!" the Stone Mouse continued to scream, refusing to tell him the answer.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think that I can't kill you? It's not difficult for me to find your Memory Flame." Zheng sneered. "If I erase all the Memory Flame of your previous lives, will you still have the ability to be reincarnated?</p>

  <p>Even if you get reincarnated, you are no longer yourself, right?"</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse's body trembled hearing Zheng's threat.</p>

  <p>The soul was just a container. If it lost all the previous memories, how could it prove that it was still itself?</p>

  <p>Thinking of the promise made by its master, the Stone Mouse compromised in the end and agreed.</p>

  <p>Gregorio would certainly come back, and then he would kill this brat!</p>

  <p>Feeling defeated, it spoke, "The other three are not important. They are just his children after he got reincarnated!"</p>

  <p>"Three children?" Zheng was slightly surprised and asked, "Who are they?"</p>

  <p>"Pascal, Aleyna, and Liusu..." the Stone Mouse replied obediently.</p>

  <p>"Aleyna and Liusu? Did they die?" Zheng continued to ask.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse replied after thinking for a while, "Die... Not exactly.</p>

  <p>In fact, Gregorio just took their Memory Flames out in these few years and poured other people's Memory Flames to fill the gap!"</p>

  <p>"I'll check it myself!"</p>

  <p>Zheng muttered and carried the Stone Mouse. He then leaped to the top of the stairs. He reached out his hand and at the same time pinched gently.</p>

  <p>In the sea of Memory Flames, three Memory Flames floated gently towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is Liusu's Memory Flame light purple?" Zheng thought that Liusu had died, and he was so sad that he couldn't even bear to read her memory.</p>

  <p>As his fingertips touched the light purple Memory Flame, he was quickly immersed in the memory of Liusu.</p>

  <p>Gradually, he came to learn more things.</p>

  <p>Since young, Liusu had shown astonishing talent. She had grown strong with the use of the destructive theurgy -the purple preternatural flame.</p>

  <p>Although she enjoyed a high position in the Han Clan, she had been lonely. When she went to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, she was still a loner.</p>

  <p>At that time, she met Zheng and he was almost clear about what happened to her later. She had originally planned to make use of him. But later on, she had discovered a lot of things and had been sent back to the divine land.</p>

  <p>After returning to the divine land, she had actually been missing him every day.</p>

  <p>Once, she secretly went to the Jiang Clan and through it, tried to sneak into the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>There were strict restrictions for True Gods to enter a universe.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, with the intervention of Harold, the Jiang Clan had already lost the control of the Evolutionary Universe. She was not aware of it so how could she make it?</p>

  <p>This girl was so naive.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled bitterly as he read this piece of memory.</p>

  <p>He continued to read. She had once again met Zheng on the Floating Island of the Han Clan. In the end, they had later explored the Time Sea Forbidden Land...</p>

  <p>These events happened not long ago, but they were replayed from the perspective of Liusu. Reading her memory on her perspective gave him a strange feeling.</p>

  <p>After the journey, Joy had taken away Zheng from the Time Sea. Liusu, Aleyna and Pascal began to cultivate in seclusion under Samuel's requirement.</p>

  <p>The problem started to happen at this period of time.</p>
