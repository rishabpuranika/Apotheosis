<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the chaotic situation, another Chaotic Source Spirit fell. As the Chaotic Source Spirits swallowed each other, the one that devoured the others strengthened itself each time.</p>

  <p>But they weren't moving all that quickly despite their amazing defensive power. So they could only be moving targets in the face of the outstanding warriors and talents of various races.</p>

  <p>A member of the Moon Spirit race was covered with a faint curtain of light.</p>

  <p>The light curtain twisted the light, allowing the warrior to hide herself completely.</p>

  <p>With that, it was difficult to detect her existence without using spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>When she saw the Chaotic Source Spirit fall, she flew across the air sharply and quickly. Then, she reached out and stuffed a bunch of amber-colored crystals into her space ring.</p>

  <p>Over 300 crystals were in her possession now, according to her count. With so many crystals, it was enough for her to reach the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Her brother was still inside an array. It was too dangerous outside, after all.</p>

  <p>This time, she could give him over a hundred Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>Overjoyed, the member of the Moon Spirit race rushed toward the nearby array.</p>

  <p>Entering it meant absolute safety. Moreover, no one had sensed her existence in the chaos.</p>

  <p>When the array was only about a hundred feet away, a great black shadow enveloped her.</p>

  <p>Sensing that something was wrong, she raised her head on instinct.</p>

  <p>A huge member of the Separate Abyss race descended from the sky. The large brown hammer in his hand then released the formidable Other Shore Power as he struck.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The Moon Spirit warrior's body was smashed into pieces. The Separate Abyss man reached out and grabbed her space ring. Then he threw all its contents on the floor, and collected all the crystals before stepping into the array.</p>

  <p>Hiding in the array, the Moon Spirit warrior's brother was wide-eyed in shock at the scene.</p>

  <p>The Separate Abyss man glared at the boy with disdain as he scolded,</p>

  <p>"We're the ones who killed the Chaotic Source Spirit! How dare you snatch them from us!"</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the array's protection, the Separate Abyss man would have killed the boy without hesitation.</p>

  <p>In the presence of the super forces, the small races were weaker and did not quite have the right to speak.</p>

  <p>On the opposite side...</p>

  <p>Hutton made use of a purple vine.</p>

  <p>It grew seemingly endlessly around a Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>The vine was highly tough, enough that neither sword nor saber could damage it. Even if the Chaotic Source Spirit tore the vine apart, it could easily grow back rapidly.</p>

  <p>While the Chaotic Source Spirit continued roaring, it had nowhere to release its power and could only struggle in vain.</p>

  <p>Behind the Chaotic Source Spirit, Dorothy and her avatar held their swords, releasing sword light all over the sky.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The sword light was like a silver cloud as it floated in the air.</p>

  <p>It continued emerging. 10, 000 rays of sword light merged into 5, 000, then 5, 000 into 2, 000, 2, 000 into 1, 000, 1000 into 500, and so on.</p>

  <p>In the end, all the rays of sword light turned into a single, highly condensed sword light.</p>

  <p>"Origin Spirit Sword Attack!"</p>

  <p>Clatter...</p>

  <p>The sword light shot straight at the Chaotic Source Spirit and hit its back.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The invincible sword attack failed yet again to break the Chaotic Source Spirit's defense. Dorothy showed no sign of surprise.</p>

  <p>Before the Chaotic Source Spirit grew too exhausted, its defense was impregnable.</p>

  <p>But its energy could be consumed quickly. If Dorothy struck it a few more times to max out its remaining energy, she could kill it.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The Iridescent Stone arrived after Dorothy attacked. It hit the back of the Chaotic Source Spirit once again.</p>

  <p>Sally's attack was nowhere near as sharp as Dorothy's and Feng Ge's, but its frequency was truly intense. The Iridescent Stone naturally disappeared the moment it hit the target and then reappeared in Sally's hand. Once she tossed the stone, it went straight for the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>From where she stayed, Feng Ge used the Warrior of the Stone Hill to produce countless streaks of blazing sword radiance.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Chaim grew rather embarrassed. He had used the Living Puppet Chains again, so now he could only watch from the sidelines and keep the others alert.</p>

  <p>Under the warriors' unrelenting attacks, the Chaotic Source Spirit grew tired. Its huge body was dismembered, and the crystals within its body began flowing out onto the ground.</p>

  <p>Spotting the amber-colored crystals, everyone was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirit contained around 2, 000 crystals? it was no wonder it was so powerful.</p>

  <p>The crystals in this Chaotic Source Spirit were enough for about ten people to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.</p>

  <p>When they managed to kill the Chaotic Source Spirit, three figures suddenly swept past them.</p>

  <p>They were from the Divine Farmer race. From the way their looks and clothes matched, they seemed to be brothers.</p>

  <p>For a long time, they were observing the entire scene. The moment the Chaotic Source Spirit fell, they took their chance and rushed toward the crystals.</p>

  <p>"Brother! Pick them up!" one of them with a mustache called out.</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, another strong man, with the naked upper body, collected all the crystals on the ground and put them into his space ring.</p>

  <p>"You're just? courting death!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's eyes filled with rage upon witnessing the scene.</p>

  <p>To shatter this Chaotic Source Spirit, they did their best to fight against it as fiercely as they could. How could they allow anyone to snatch away what they had just obtained?</p>

  <p>When a streak of light flashed across her eyes, the Warrior of the Stone Hill waved swords with a thousand left hands simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"One thousand swords!"</p>

  <p>The weapons intertwined, forming a kind of dense sword-net.</p>

  <p>"Mingle and become one!"</p>

  <p>With that, the Warrior of the Stone Hill launched a powerful sword attack.</p>

  <p>The three-dimensional sword-net served as something like a cage with an astonishing ray of sword radiance. It mixed with the divine flames of the Jin Wu. With its glowing aura, it attacked the three brothers head-on.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge wasn't alone? Dorothy, employing the Origin swordsmanship, Hutton, Sally, the other Nine Li warriors, and even some disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace also attacked the trio.</p>

  <p>The three were known to be powerful in the Divine Farmer race. While they might not have been as strong as Mount and Mya, they were still second to them.</p>

  <p>With the confidence they had in their skills, they were daring enough to snatch the Chaotic Source Spirits right in front of the Taiyi Heaven Palace's people.</p>

  <p>"Shadow Realm!"</p>

  <p>The leader of the three brothers patted his head lightly, making a dark gem pop and rotate out of it.</p>

  <p>As the gem spun, their bodies turned somewhat vague.</p>

  <p>"The Dark Realm Stone?" Chaim raised his brows at the reveal.</p>

  <p>The stone was a mysterious type of Other Shore Token. Once it was activated, it could allow itself and the people around it to enter a unique state where all attacks were rendered useless.</p>

  <p>"Clatter..."</p>

  <p>Countless rays of sword radiance pierced through their bodies and shot out.</p>

  <p>After a slight wobble, the three brothers were completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>The sight had the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace wide-eyed in shock.</p>

  <p>All of the three men from the Divine Farmer race had smug smiles on their faces. "Let's go!" said their leader. "We'll be safe once we enter the array!"</p>

  <p> </p>
