  <p>
</p>

  <p>The red light glinting in so many pairs of eyes instilled fear in everyone.</p>

  <p>This red light was fatal. Anyone exposed to it would immediately be reduced to a pile of dust.</p>

  <p>How could they escape a weapon that was being released and concentrated on them by so many eyes?</p>

  <p>"Back off!" Zheng's face darkened at the sight of these eyes.</p>

  <p>The Wing King, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, the Eternal Realm Hunters, and the people in black robes quickly stayed away from the door and retreated towards the edge of the Pure Sky Platform.</p>

  <p>They were unable to escape the red light but there was still some room for them to dodge its attacks after they had distanced themselves from the black giant.</p>

  <p>Even Campbell retreated along with them.</p>

  <p>Zheng was the only one to have moved forward instead of retreating.</p>

  <p>For the safety of the others, he had to lure the black giant to the other side of the Pure Sky Platform and finish it off.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>The presence of so many eyes took the black giant a longer time to accumulate the red light.</p>

  <p>And Zheng had already seized this opportunity to launch an attack.</p>

  <p>"Break!" Zheng shouted, jumping up.</p>

  <p>His spear spun once, and came at the black giant's body.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Zheng had earlier been afraid of using up the Light of Annihilation in the Holy Stone, which was why he had tried his best to launch as accurate an attack as possible. He didn't dare waste any light.</p>

  <p>And now that he had burnt his bridges, Zheng couldn't care less about anything else.</p>

  <p>Rays of spear radiance whooshed through space and headed straight for the black giant.</p>

  <p>The black head moved at a snail's pace in the beginning, an easy target for Zheng. Now that it had a body, it was a complete entity, and under Gianni's control, it was more agile than Zheng had imagined it would be.</p>

  <p>The spear radiance that Zheng had sent out was like a white glowing net, covering the vital parts of the black giant's body. With this round of attack, Zheng planned to pierce through at least twenty pairs of the black giant's eyes.</p>

  <p>But the moment the spear radiance approached it, the black giant took a single step to the side.</p>

  <p>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!</p>

  <p>The spear radiance pierced through the black giant's body and created dozens of holes, but hit only one eye on its chest.</p>

  <p>Zheng was not surprised.</p>

  <p>Gianni was by no means mediocre as a warrior from the Ten Directions House. One didn't earn Campbell's respect by being merely mediocre. It would be strange if Zheng could finish off such an opponent with too much ease.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>Zheng had pierced through only one of the black giant's eyes, but more eyes opened on its body. The red light that had accumulated for a long time within them spurted out of them.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh...</p>

  <p>About forty red light columns shot out from the black giant's body.</p>

  <p>As the black giant continued to spin, the red light columns shot out randomly in all directions.</p>

  <p>The light columns didn't disappear until they had extended to outside the Pure Sky Platform. No one could escape it.</p>

  <p>"Disperse!" the Wing King shouted as a warning.</p>

  <p>His wings flapped in the air, his strange posture making him look like water flowing towards the light columns.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others used different theurgies to dodge the light columns.</p>

  <p>Squeak! Squeak...</p>

  <p>King Ieuan's tiny size was an advantage that allowed it to escape easily. But no one knew where light columns would go or where they would emerge from. Sometimes, a light column seemed to be hurtling somewhere but would suddenly change direction without warning. King Ieuan was unfortunately unable to avoid the red light and was hit in the legs.</p>

  <p>Its legs had already turned to ashes by the time it jumped up.</p>

  <p>Pearson stretched out a hand as he saw King Ieuan fall backwards. A thin, almost invisible, spider thread wrapped around King Ieuan's body, lifting it up.</p>

  <p>Pearson managed to save King Ieuan's life now. But yet another column of red light rose from his side and swept up towards him. He only had half his body left now, and his other half turned to dust.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Pearson, his body was special, having been originally woven with spider threads. His body hissed after losing half of it, following which, the disappeared half of his body returned to him, woven by the spider threads.</p>

  <p>However, he was much shorter and paler than before.</p>

  <p>The men in black robes were facing even worse.</p>

  <p>The leader still had the power to protect himself. But his men almost had no power to resist the red light columns. If they weren't careful enough, the red light columns would find them and turn them into piles of dust.</p>

  <p>The leader tried his best to save his men while dodging the columns himself but how would he make it in the face of so many red light columns coming his way? Three men in black robes had died in seconds.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Zheng sprinted forward for a while before a column came for him. He lowered his body and then rolled upwards into the air.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The spear radiance transformed from the Light of Annihilation hit the black giant's legs, catching and decimating an eye on its leg.</p>

  <p>Zheng rose into the air again after killing the red eye. Before long, he rose tens of thousands of feet into the air to reach the same height as the black giant's head. The black giant looked at Zheng and was about to send out a red light column when Zheng's long spear began to shake and spear radiance once again shot out at the giant.</p>

  <p>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!</p>

  <p>Zheng fell down. Silver spear radiance continued to pierce through the eyes on the giant's body.</p>

  <p>Although the black giant's eyes would regrow, Zheng would try his best to destroy them in order to reduce the number of red light columns and also ease the pressure on the others.</p>

  <p>On the other Pure Sky Platform, Gianni rolled his eyes when he saw Zheng jumping up and down like a flea.</p>

  <p>The human was quite fast, but that was just how the average person saw and understood it.</p>

  <p>Zheng was able to launch a series of attacks around the black giant because Gianni hadn't taken him seriously.</p>

  <p>"What an annoying bug!" Gianni exclaimed.</p>

  <p>And then, he suddenly raised his hand.</p>

  <p>The black giant wasn't slower than Gianni just because of its huge size. In fact, the two of them moved almost in unison.</p>

  <p>Gianni looked at the void before him and remained silent for a few seconds.</p>

  <p>He then reached out in the air suddenly, grabbing at it like he was catching a fly.</p>

  <p>The black giant's right hand was doing the same thing at an incredibly high speed.</p>

  <p>Zheng concentrated on piercing through the eyes but he was also on guard against the black giant's hand. But he was astonished, for he had never thought that the black giant, who he had assumed to be clumsy because of its huge size, could be so fast.</p>

  <p>By the time he realized that the giant's hand was coming for him, it was too late. The black giant had already scooped him up in its hand.</p>

  <p>"It's over now. You can go to hell."</p>

  <p>Gianni's voice sounded from the black giant's mouth.</p>

  <p>He was speaking the human language. Fuxi, who was still dodging the red light columns in the distance, heard him. And so did the Snake Goddess and the others. They began to panic when they saw that the black giant had seized Zheng.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The black giant also had an eye in its palm, and before long, the red light in it burst out of it.</p>
