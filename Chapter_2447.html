  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Stop."</p>

  <p>Reinhard, who was leading the way, suddenly stopped and looked at his side.</p>

  <p>Surprised, the rest still followed his order and stopped walking. Wondering at what he just felt, they followed his gaze.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in the heavy mist. It was so quiet that they could hear each other breathing. The air felt heavy.</p>

  <p>They had been down this road for some time now. Previously, they could still see some huge shadows in the mist.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, all of the shadows had disappeared, as if they had all retreated to the depths of the mist. Staring at the darkness surrounding them, the True Gods were unable to question what was causing the delay.</p>

  <p>"Why are we stopping here?"</p>

  <p>"There seems to be nothing around us!"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't see anything too."</p>

  <p>The other True Gods looked at each other in dismay. They thought it was a bad call. They were in the middle of nowhere.</p>

  <p>Frowning, Reinhard sighed. Was his perception wrong?</p>

  <p>Keeping this in mind, he flicked his fingers.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The sound of unsheathing a sword came from his sleeve.</p>

  <p>Shooting out from his sleeve, the tiny sword circled in front of his eyes.</p>

  <p>It was a short sword, almost like a dagger, only a hand long. Its body shone dimly against the mist. The exquisite detail on its grip and blade made it look like a work of art.</p>

  <p>"Heed my command and detect any dangers around us. I command you to ring once you find any!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The ringing sound of the tiny sword in front of Reinhard surprised everyone.</p>

  <p>But just like a compass, the pointed end of the blade did not stop in one direction. Instead it continuously swayed in the air, as if trying to find a target.</p>

  <p>The group were all startled by the sound and had their eyes locked onto the piece of metal floating and swaying mid-air. After a while, it stopped and pointed downwards.</p>

  <p>"Underground?"</p>

  <p>Furrowing his brows, Reinhard uttered loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>

  <p>The members of the Sword Clan exchanged confused glances with each other.</p>

  <p>This tiny sword was the Sword Clan's treasure, the Tribulation Exterminating Sword, which could tell the direction of dangers to a certain extent. And based from experience, it was never wrong.</p>

  <p>'Could they really have gone deep into the ground?'</p>

  <p>Pondering to himself, Luo Zheng's eyes flashed with confusion. Voicing out his concern, he finally asked, "Are the incarnations of fear intelligent?"</p>

  <p>This was a very important problem.</p>

  <p>Ordinary incarnations were easy to deal with. Even though some were really powerful, they were lacking intelligence, making them easy to deal with. Being such a mechanical and stupid opponent, they had many flaws and weaknesses.</p>

  <p>However, an opponent with intelligence and skills would require a lot of energy and stamina to defeat.</p>

  <p>Intelligent enemies were good at hiding their shortcomings and employing their strongest abilities. They could trick their opponents into thinking they were weak, and strike when they least expected it.</p>

  <p>"Yes! More than their physical bodies, they would have corresponding wisdom and their original memories!" Reinhard replied.</p>

  <p>"What? What do you mean by having the memories of the original bodies?"</p>

  <p>Stunned, Luo Zheng clarified.</p>

  <p>Nodding his head, Reinhard answered with a wry smile, "Very miraculous, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"But how is this even possible?" It didn't make sense. Luo Zheng tried hard to grasp what Reinhard was explaining.</p>

  <p>"That is indeed possible. If what you fear is a certain creature in the divine land, then all the memories of this creature, including its temper, disposition and habits, will all be recreated. It would be exactly the same as its original version. Our Sword Clan has long confirmed this fact," Reinhard explained calmly.</p>

  <p>Seeing the incredulous expression on Luo Zheng's face, he continued, "You should know that the debate venue was set up by an Other Shore Realm master.</p>

  <p>The creatures at the Other Shore Realm are far stronger than us. Their skills and intelligence are far beyond our imagination!"</p>

  <p>"You are right,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng agreed.</p>

  <p>It was true that he was clueless on what the capabilities of the warriors at the Other Shore Realm were.</p>

  <p>They must have surpassed the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Thinking about it, Luo Zheng realized that it was very likely that they were extraordinary creatures. If that was the case, it made sense that the skeleton was able to set such an unimaginable spell.</p>

  <p>He was about to nod his head to agree with Reinhard when suddenly...</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The sound came from underground, calling everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the tiny sword, which was floating in front of Reinhard, suddenly swerved into a certain direction!</p>

  <p>"Be ready. Something is coming! Its position is..." Reinhard advised, following the tiny sword, "At the back! From below!" Reinhard shouted in a hurry.</p>

  <p>Although his warning came beforehand, many of the True Gods were still in a maze as he only gave a rough position.</p>

  <p>"Oh no! Hurry but watch your step!"</p>

  <p>"It's coming from underground! Come and help Gage out!"</p>

  <p>The sound was getting louder every second. Everyone's eyes darted towards its direction, and they found that Gage Tang had been pulled down, with only half of his body exposed on the ground.</p>

  <p>Despite his desperate struggle, something unknown quickly pulled him back underground. His voice faded as fast as he disappeared into the hole.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Standing from afar, Duke saw this scene and quickly made his earthy yellow avatar rush out with his mind.</p>

  <p>The avatar, carrying a saber, lowered its body slightly. In a flash, it brandished a crescent shaped saber light, slashing it directly on the ground.</p>

  <p>The avatar Duke created was a Holy Being from the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>A big hole appeared on the ground instantly.</p>

  <p>Half of Gage's body had been buried in the earth. To everyone's astonishment, the slash made by the avatar cut off the lower part of Gage's body, just a little under his abdomen, without any hesitation!</p>

  <p>"Duke! Why did you attack Gage?" Donne shouted furiously. He couldn't believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>Quickly pulling Gage out from the ground, he saw that half of his body, including his legs and haunch, were cut off by the avatar controlled by Duke, making Donne even angrier.</p>

  <p>"What?" Duke asked coldly. "I didn't damage his elixir field or soul. Losing his legs is better than being dragged away to the unknown."</p>

  <p>As a True God, he knew that Gage could regenerate the other parts of his body as long as his elixir field and soul were not destroyed.</p>

  <p>Rushing over to where they stood, Reinhard raised his long sword toward the ground and picked up something in the soil. A wriggling thing that looked more like an antenna from the unknown creature had been cut off when the avatar controlled by Duke earlier saved Gage.</p>

  <p>"What creature is this? Has anyone seen anything like this before?"</p>

  <p>Reinhard asked, raising the antenna for everyone to see.</p>

  <p>He knew that the creatures that appeared in the mist were all created from their fears. Someone among them should be able to recognize it.</p>

  <p>Looking at the antenna, all the True Gods shook their heads.</p>

  <p>He held it higher with his sword, allowing Enoch to take a better look at it.</p>

  <p>The latter's face immediately turned pale as he asked cautiously, "Could, could it be a Multiple Antennae Snake?"</p>

  <p>"How could it be?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't the Multiple Antennae Snake an ancient beast? It had been extinct completely. Who the hell has seen it before?"</p>

  <p>The other True Gods all shouted doubtfully.</p>

  <p>After a short while, Enoch took a deep breath and replied, "I, I think I had seen it before."</p>

  <p>His statement triggered everyone's doubts.</p>

  <p>Seeing that nobody was willing to believe him, Enoch continued, "I've been wondering about it since I saw many antennae in the mist earlier. My clan has a secret cultivation place left behind from the ancient times. After it was restored by my father, the children of our clan are able to practice there.</p>

  <p>This secret place enables us to see the Multiple Antennae Snake from the ancient times. I was lucky since I saw it once when I was still very young.</p>

  <p>After that day, I had nightmares about it for three full years."</p>

  <p>After hearing his explanation, the other True Gods' expressions all became restless.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Why would your father repair an ancient relic? We'll all die here because of you!"</p>

  <p>"The Multiple Antennae Snake is an ancient beast. If what you're saying is true, we will be in great trouble!"</p>

  <p>"Based from the records of the ancient books, the Multiple Antennae Snake is indeed good at crawling underground. Noting that the earth here is soft soil made of the accumulated bark and tree roots of countless years, it's very suitable for it to move around."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing all this, many True Gods stared fiercely at Enoch.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't his fault. Everyone had his or her own fear. Enoch had been clear that he had seen the Multiple Antennae Snake when he was very young, and he had almost forgotten about it when he reached adulthood.</p>

  <p>However, this kind of memory was usually deeply hidden in everyone's mind, and the debate venue had finally awaken it.</p>
