  <p>
</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, at the moment, Luo Luo Zheng had over that amount of heavenly essence. Last time when he owned more than 600 drops of heavenly essence, he entrusted the auction of 50 drops to Wurth, indicating that he still had over 500 drops left with him. On another occasion, when he refined the Streamer Sword, it cost more than a hundred drops. Adding up all of these, including the bottle with a hundred drops of heavenly essence in his hand currently, Luo Luo Zheng had a total of 400 drops of heavenly essence remaining.</p>

  <p>"Since it's so popular and in demand, should the hundred drops be divided into two fifties and sold at two separate auctions or sold entirely at one auction? Which way suits you better?" Luo Luo Zheng inquired with an apparent tone of curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Well? Well, of course, the best bet is to sell it as a whole at one auction!" Owing to a sudden burst of excitement, Wurth spoke out in an abrupt high pitch, but he quickly covered his mouth and looked around carefully, turning his chubby head twice in a bid to check if someone was paying close attention to what he just said. After all, he could not expose the secret of his business, that the heavenly essence he auctioned was being procured from Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing his cautious behaviour, Luo Luo Zheng was amused as he briskly responded, "Don't worry. Nobody was paying attention to our conversation!" As Luo Zheng's strength of soul was far more powerful than that of other outer disciples of Drizzle Peak and Wurth, even if he closed his eyes, he could easily detect if anyone was paying any attention to him.</p>

  <p>"If any weapon refiner wants to upgrade a low-grade fairy weapon into a medium-grade fairy weapon, 50 drops of heavenly essence may not be enough. Hence, in their refining process, no weapon refiner will have the thought to save even a single drop of essence they have, that is to say, they will utilise all the heavenly essence into the furnace in one shot. The more amount of heavenly essence, the higher the success rate will be,"</p>

  <p>Wurth explained what he thought in detail.</p>

  <p>For example, if 50 drops of heavenly essence were mixed with a single low-grade fairy weapon for refining, the odds for its successful upgrade to a medium-grade fairy weapon was only approximately 20%, but if a hundred drops of heavenly essence were to be added, the odds of that success would witness a sharp increase to about 50%.</p>

  <p>Therefore, this basically meant, the value of a hundred drops of heavenly essence, in fact, was way more than that of 50 drops of heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>Just like the last time when Luo Luo Zheng refined the Streamer Sword, he poured all his heavenly essence into the refining process, which could be termed as the right way to refine a sword. Nevertheless, he poured the essence all over the sword instead of focusing on the primary parts, which was considered a great waste of the valuable essence. Thus, it was reasonable to believe that he should have a large amount of heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>"In that case, this time, Wurth, I am also counting on you for the auction!" Luo Luo Zheng expressed in a rather sincere tone. Soon after that, Luo Luo Zheng handed Wurth the bottle full of a hundred drops of heavenly essence.</p>

  <p>The hundred drops of heavenly essence were gathered in the small bottle, like a hundred elves, emitting a silver-white glow. It appeared so alluring. Upon seeing so much heavenly essence, Wurth too felt a little overwhelmed, as he wondered where Luo Luo Zheng got a hold of so much of it!</p>

  <p>However, he knew very clearly that it was none of his concern as it was Luo Zheng's private business. He would certainly not be nosy and petty to indulge in any gossip about it. After carefully putting it into his Space Ring, he smiled and politely said, "Luo Luo Zheng, thank you for the opportunity. I will surely live up to your expectation!"</p>

  <p>This was the second time Luo Luo Zheng had sold a hundred drops of heavenly essence, and according to Wurth's judgement, Luo Luo Zheng would have a lot more of that in hand, and he estimated that the quantity was surely over a hundred drops. With that thought, he guessed that Luo Luo Zheng had discovered a secret place, where there was a large amount of heavenly essence available for use or that he found a way to make heavenly essence!</p>

  <p>However, whether it was the former or the latter situation, it was Luo Zheng's own luck and destiny. Wurth would never interfere in those matters.</p>

  <p>Currently, Luo Luo Zheng was facing a money crunch, and at this crucial point, Wurth offered him another two hundred and fifty-two thousand cubic crystals earned from the auction, which was really a timely intervention that solved his pressing need for money.</p>

  <p>The next day, Luo Luo Zheng went to exchange 50, 000 cubic crystals for the 25, 000 points. Barely with any remaining, he rushed to the Seven Star Sword Light Platform.</p>

  <p>Similar to the Lake of the Magical Fish, Seven Star Sword Light Platform was also a special area dedicated for practising martial arts. The only difference was that Lake of the Magical Fish, which was built decades back, could only accommodate one person at a time to practice, while Seven Star Sword Light Platform could accommodate hundreds of people to practice at the same time! This was quite the advantage.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had thought that if hundreds of people could practice together at Seven Star Sword Light Platform at one time, then unlike the long waiting period in the Lake of the Magical Fish, he might not need to wait at all. Before that moment, when Luo Luo Zheng went to Lake of the Magical Fish, he often had to wait outside for several hours altogether as someone was practising inside. What was worse, sometimes, he had to wait for many more hours, because someone else had reached before him and was waiting for a longer time.</p>

  <p>The charge of Lake of the Magical Fish was rather expensive, but the practising effects were surprisingly good which justified the price, not to mention that hundreds of points were merely a drop in the bucket to those top noble clans, despite that it was an astronomical number to ordinary disciples.</p>

  <p>But when finally Luo Luo Zheng came to Seven Star Sword Light Platform, he was dumbfounded. Even here, there was a long queue of people waiting before him, and a ball park figure was that there were several hundred people waiting for their turn?</p>

  <p>"How come there are so many people here?" Luo Luo Zheng murmured to himself with increasing doubt and depression. Yet, it took him quite a few days to get here. So he still chose to wait and practice here. Watching the crowded place with a sad face, he slowly walked to the end of the queue to wait for his turn patiently.</p>

  <p>The Seven Star Sword Light Platform was built six years ago by the Cloud Sect. Back then, it was said that a clan had discovered a polar magical stone in the north, 100 feet high and about 300 feet wide. After Cloud Sect discovered the stone's existence, it managed to buy it at a mighty cost.</p>

  <p>Such a giant polar magical stone, even the great figures of Cloud Sect, could not transport all at once. Eventually, the giant stone was cut into six pieces, and each was loaded into a giant flying chariot, transported back and placed in the Seven Star Sword Light Platform.</p>

  <p>Later, the Cloud Sect magic array masters placed magic arrays inside the Seven Star Sword Light Platform. With the added power of the polar magical stones, people could practice and greatly improve their swordplay skills there!</p>

  <p>Although Seven Star Sword Light Platform could also act like the place for people to practice the use of all kinds of weapons including sword, spear, and stick, but it was gradually found that it had the best effect for improving swordplay skills. In addition to this, the number of people who practiced swordplay at the Cloud Sect was the largest. Gradually, the Seven Star Sword Light Platform basically became a special place dedicated to practice swordplay.</p>
