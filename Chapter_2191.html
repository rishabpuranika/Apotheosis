</p>

  <p>The test that took place within the Consulting God Hall of Heavenly Han House usually lasted a total of seven days.</p>

  <p>To proving godly warriors, the Heavenly Han House's test wasn't just an exam to verify their abilities, but even more so, an opportunity for cultivation.</p>

  <p>There were a few of the proving godly warriors who usually listened to the teachings of True Gods outside the Heavenly Han House. Now that they were inside the Consulting God Hall, they were capable of using what they had learned in order to comprehend the internal momentum inscribed on the Divine Dao Tablets.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that these Divine Dao Tablets were only mere imitations, being here was still a rare opportunity for such proving godly warriors to cultivate.</p>

  <p>Throughout the seven days, more and more proving godly warriors were recognized by the Divine Dao Tablets. For these proving godly warriors, they entered the most crucial stage in their entire lives after the recognition. It was then that their fate would be completely changed forever.</p>

  <p>This was because the chances of one mastering Divine Dao in the Heavenly Han House were rather high. Becoming a True God in the future was equivalent to obtaining the chance of living forever, as well as other limitless possibilities.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, things were a little different on his behalf.</p>

  <p>Over the past few days, all of the proving godly warriors present had been used to watching miracles he had created.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng tirelessly traversed through the Divine Dao Tablets, continuously absorbing their internal momentum and he was equally constantly acknowledged by the Divine Dao Tablets.</p>

  <p>Other than the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique, there were certain other Divine Dao that required special conditions and physiques for cultivation. However, despite the fact that Luo Luo Zheng had ignored these requirements, he had just as well received the acknowledgement from these Divine Dao Tablets, too.</p>

  <p>This was more than miraculous. In the eyes of the other disbelieving warriors, Luo Luo Zheng seemed to have used some sort of trick to achieve this.</p>

  <p>Such a trick was completely unheard-of though, and therefore, its possibilities really came as an astonishment to everyone.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Han House didn't interfere. Although Luo Luo Zheng had disrupted the internal momentum on the Divine Dao Tablets in a very short period of time, it hadn't caused much damage to the Divine Dao Tablets. Now, the more outstanding Luo Zheng's performance became, the more confident the Heavenly Han House would be when they recommended candidates to the Han Clan on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>It took approximately an hour to absorb the internal momentum of a Divine Dao Tablet into the Infinity Ruler. Over the course of these seven days and their nights, Luo Luo Zheng hadn't rested in the least. And yet, he had only successfully absorbed the internal momentum of two hundred and sixty Divine Dao Tablets.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng looked absolutely drained on the last day, which was to be expected, considering the amount of energy he had spent.</p>

  <p>In fact, every time he absorbed the internal momentum of a Divine Dao Tablet, he would first have to resist the attacks of the internal momentum. Luo Zheng's soul might be as strong as a True God's, but currently, his soul force was constantly being consumed. Without any rest, his soul force gradually weakened and he became very tired.</p>

  <p>When Malloy announced the end of the Heavenly Han House test, Luo Luo Zheng helplessly glanced at the remaining Divine Dao Tablets. The Divine Dao Tablets that stood in the distance were still radiating light, seemingly calling for him, but because he had to follow the rules, he had no other choice but to leave the Consulting God Hall along with the others.</p>

  <p>A small total of sixty-seven of the original one hundred thousand proving godly warriors received Divine Dao Tablets' acknowledgements.</p>

  <p>Compared to last year's number of less than twenty warriors though, this year's total was more than three times the number of last year. Even when comparing the total to the number on a bumper year, sixty-seven was still pretty impressive.</p>

  <p>Certainly, Malloy and the group of True Gods were quite satisfied with this number. And of all the warriors who had received acknowledgements, Luo Luo Zheng was the one who gave them the most confidence.</p>

  <p>Malloy felt the sudden impulse to contact the Han Clan right away and send Luo Luo Zheng to the Floating Island immediately!</p>

  <p>Every sixteen years, the main Han Clan would send someone to Heavenly Han House in order to recruit a group of warriors and bring them to the Floating Island for cultivation. It had already been fifteen years since the last time the main Han Clan had come here for recruitment.</p>

  <p>Next year, the main Han Clan would once again come to the Heavenly Han House in order to recruit warriors. Not only would they pick a portion of True Gods, they would also inspect outstanding proving godly warriors. The year before the main Han Clan came to select warriors was also the year when the Heavenly Han House held a bigger test. These proving godly warriors hoped that they would be lucky enough to be chosen by the Han Clan and enter the Floating Island, thus becoming a member of the divine land's core power and rising to prominence.</p>

  <p>That said though, the Han Clan sub-branches equally had special rights when it came to recommending warriors. If they were to meet an extremely outstanding warrior, they wouldn't have to wait the aforementioned 16 years. The only requirement was to send someone to apply to the main Han Clan, but the precondition was that the warrior really had outstanding abilities.</p>

  <p>The few proving godly warriors who had successfully passed through the Heavenly Han House's test were arranged to stay in a courtyard, while the rest were dismissed. Those who failed could only wait until next year to take the test once again.</p>

  <p>The courtyard where the select sixty-seven stayed was very elegantly constructed, with a few bridges built on top of a beautiful pond. Within the pond, a group of little fish with golden scales could be seen swimming around happily. Pink lotus flowers adorned the water and here, they would never wilt.</p>
