<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1472 Osborn </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The stars before them were a complete, albeit scaled-down version of the universe. It was, quite frankly, a magnificent sight!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't just jump into the abyss to go through all those tests just to see stars.</p>

  <p>He reached out to grab his spirit beast bag to pull out Livingston.</p>

  <p>The puppet had been forcibly stuffed into the spirit beast bag previously, so when he got out, he immediately took in his surroundings.</p>

  <p>"Huh? You've barged into Osborn's residence!" Livingston exclaimed.</p>

  <p>The puppet was someone of great origins. Both Zheng's and Xun's eyes lit up at his remark.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't had the time to bring Livingston out lately because of all the things he had to do while in the abyss. He only found an opportunity to finally seek counsel with the puppet after reaching the bottom. He figured that asking Livingston for advice would be useful in breaking through this stage.</p>

  <p>"Oops, that's not right," Livingston said with a laugh. "The entire Endless Abyss is technically Osborn's residence. But this small Milky Way was constructed by me personally. It is a complete replica of our universe down to the very last star. Whatever you see here is in sync with the sky outside. Osborn used it to cultivate his Transcendent Divine Might� Star Plucking Technique!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately shot Xun a look.</p>

  <p>The sight of this Milky Way had awed them, but Livingston's revelation had now truly put them in a state of bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Star Plucking Technique? Transcendent Divine Might?" Xun repeated in wonder.</p>

  <p>The Transcendent Divine Might was something that only a Supreme Lord could create. There might be a lot of Supreme Lords in this universe, but that number remained constant and Xun knew just about every single one of them. However, this was the first time she had heard of the Star Plucking Technique.</p>

  <p>Only two kinds of Transcendent Divine Might used the power of the stars; one was Zheng's incomplete "Stellar Body" while the other was the "Dual Forest of Stars Theurgy" cultivated by an ogre Supreme Lord. She had never heard of a third technique.</p>

  <p>"Even I do not know of this Star Plucking Technique," the cyan dragon said.</p>

  <p>Xun shot a look at the rotating stars. "The universe regards the heavens as a supreme existence. Do you know the name of the current round of heavens?"</p>

  <p>Each round of heavens had its own will and its own name.</p>

  <p>The origins of this ancient yet unknown Supreme Lord was making Xun suspicious.</p>

  <p>The universe had a constant 128 Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>The arrival of a new Supreme Lord meant the death of another. The number always had to remain at 128, no more and no less.</p>

  <p>The boundless universe had countless grand world lords at the same cultivation level as Supreme Lords. However, there were no vacancies for the role. Until a Supreme Lord died, none of them could ever hope to be promoted to the role.</p>

  <p>This was why it was so easy to record the identities of the Supreme Lords� they were mostly a constant existence in the universe. The historical records pertaining to each Supreme Lord were meticulously recorded� from their birth to their death and the moment they ascended the role.</p>

  <p>That was why it was extremely peculiar for this certain Supreme Lord to be almost virtually unknown. It could be Osborn, the one Livingston referred to, but they had never heard of Supreme Lord Osborn before.</p>

  <p>Xun's question confused Livingston even more. "The name of the current round of heavens is naturally Nature. The stars are connected and this is the Milky Way. Why do you ask this?"</p>

  <p>"Nature?" Luo Zheng repeated, his eyes widening in surprise.</p>

  <p>Xun's eyes flashed. She had already suspected it from the start, but Livingston's reply still surprised her slightly.</p>

  <p>Their reactions did not go unnoticed by Livingston. He had spent quite a lot of time sleeping within this puppet he had created. He now figured there might've been some changes to the universe he once knew before.</p>

  <p>It was only through infusing with Zheng's life vitality jades that he was able to regain consciousness. After his awakening, he estimated that he had probably been asleep for at least 300 million years.</p>

  <p>Xun's question about the name of the current round of heavens baffled him. His head even froze in place for a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that the heavens already changed?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Xun nodded in response. "It's Cosmos now," she told him.</p>

  <p>Nature had passed through a grand era and finally collapsed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, still held a Heavenly Fragment of this past era in his hands.</p>

  <p>The end of a round of heavens signaled the end of a grand era. All the living creatures in the universe were fated to die, along with the planets.</p>

  <p>It was with death that a new round of heavens began.</p>

  <p>Livingston initially thought he was only asleep for 300 million years, but in truth, the entire grand era of 3.6 billion years had already passed. He never thought it was possible for him to sleep that long.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I see. No wonder the weapons I refined had all turned into scrap metal," he remarked. "It didn't make any sense for the heavenly essence to completely disappear just like that! Now I know why. The heavens changed. The heavenly essence is naturally useless now."</p>

  <p>The heavenly essence could be created when a weapon refiner observed the Heavenly Law, and he would then seal it into a weapon.</p>

  <p>It actually meant that the weapon refiner comprehended the rules of the heavens.</p>

  <p>But once the heavens changed, then the previous round's heavenly essence would be deemed completely useless. That was why Livingston's ancient treasures had all been reduced to nothing.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect Osborn to be so capable! He actually brought me to cross over a whole grand era," Livingston said with a laugh. He looked at Luo Zheng with a trace of arrogance on his face. "No wonder you young people haven't heard of me! I'll have you know, I'm the greatest weapon refiner in the entire universe! Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes lit up at this revelation.</p>

  <p>He had thought that the puppet was merely bragging, but now he realized that he might have been telling the truth. It was highly possible that Livingston was the greatest weapon refiner to have lived in the previous round of the heavens.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but see this as a wonderful opportunity. The weapon refining workshop in the fairy palace still stood empty. If he could manage to start it up, then this puppet would be the perfect candidate to manage it. One could only imagine the kind of weapons the greatest weapon refiner could make.</p>

  <p>However, that was a discussion for later. There was still a more important matter at hand.</p>

  <p>"Was Osborn a Supreme Lord of the previous round of heavens?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Livingston nodded in confirmation before walking towards the miniature universe in front of them. He reached out to casually pick up a star and the entire galaxy revolved at a much faster speed. Luo Zheng and Xun could only watch as a path started to form right in the middle of the Milky Way.</p>

  <p>"Back then, in order to have a long lifespan, I begged Osborn to find the rarest material in the entire universe to help me create this puppet body.</p>

  <p>The price was to stay in this place and help him refine weapons for 400, 000 years. This puppet body is driven by life vitality, and I am unable to absorb vitality between heaven and earth. Osborn would send me a massive amount of life vitality jades once in a while, but suddenly, the deliveries stopped."</p>

  <p>After using up the life vitality jades, Livingston was lulled into a deep slumber and the rest was history.</p>

  <p>"I created this Milky Way. Osborn should have died long ago. I wonder what other treasures he left behind. Come with me," he said, beckoning them towards him. Luo Zheng couldn't help but notice the tinge of sadness in the puppet's tone.</p>

  <p>Billions of years had passed in a single dream. The world he once knew was no more and the friends he once had were all dead. Livingston was alive, but the world he knew was already dead.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Xun followed behind him into that ray of starlight within the rotating Milky Way.</p>
