  <p>However, when he saw Luo Luo Zheng use his basic swordsmanship, he realized that if he lowered himself to the nature level, he would never be able to defeat Luo Luo Zheng. Jacques had to abandon the plan then. Reluctantly, he admitted that Luo Luo Zheng might have more talent and potential than him.</p>

  <p>"It's not my time to use it yet," Luo Luo Zheng said as the demonic phantoms flew around him.</p>

  <p>"If you don't use it now, you will not get another chance!" Jacques was onto Luo Luo Zheng before he even finished speaking, darting over to him in moments.</p>

  <p>His white bone armor had overwhelming defensive power. Even the armor of the fairy weapon was inferior to it. His armor was made out of his own life vitality and did not burden him with weight. It was connected to his mind, so he could control it more smoothly as if it was an extension of his body.</p>

  <p>Jacques stood before him, a threatening Mu Ning emanating from him, but Luo Luo Zheng was in no hurry. Luo Luo Zheng controlled his six demonic phantoms mentally and they rushed over to Jacques at the same time.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Jacques, covered with the white bone armor, was like a human-shaped chariot that hit the six demonic phantoms.</p>

  <p>His white bone armor was tough, but the demonic phantoms were not weak either. At the first hit itself, the demonic phantoms intercepted Jacques.</p>

  <p>Jacques took a slow, deep breath and sneered. Several more patches of blood fog exploded, surrounding him. The almost-perfect white bone armor now had some new modifications. Two horns were added to it, leaving it more defensive than ever.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect your summoning to have this kind of strength. Let's see how you resist me this time!" Jacques bolted to Luo Luo Zheng once again. He was truly confident about his strength. Without using any complex techniques, he tried to smash Luo Luo Zheng, singularly relying on his white bone armor.</p>

  <p>He was right to be so self-assured. The white bone armor had been upgraded. When the demonic phantoms bumped against it for a second time, narrow cracks appeared on them, knocking them to pieces and turning them to dust, back into the demonic life vitality.</p>

  <p>"So you wanted to block me with that trick? Hah... let's see you try again." Jacques grinned victoriously as he sprinted over to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, before he could take even two steps, the six splintered demonic phantoms congealed again and dashed over to him.</p>

  <p>"Did you even watch me fight before?" Luo Luo Zheng smiled. "My demonic phantoms can't be broken so easily."</p>

  <p>Unlike in the ordinary cultivation methods, the demonic phantoms were made out of life vitality. They were avatars that Luo Luo Zheng borrowed from the heaven and the earth, but he didn't need to return them if they were broken. They could be congealed repeatedly, taking shape to fight the enemy once again.</p>

  <p>It was still early in the battle. The demonic phantoms recovering after being crushed into pieces brought Jacques much trouble.</p>

  <p>He had wasted five minutes on these phantoms already.</p>

  <p>"Jacques attacks too simply. He wants to defeat Luo Luo Zheng by just trying to knock the phantoms around?"</p>

  <p>"He is definitely more talented than that. But he likes to keep it simple and crude. Luo Luo Zheng, however, is not easy to handle. He is a very patient fighter."</p>

  <p>"He really is patient. When Jacques tried to hit at those demonic phantoms, Luo Luo Zheng acted as if he had all the time in the world to take a rest."</p>

  <p>It was an exaggeration to say that Luo Luo Zheng took a rest on the competition field. But mind-controlling the demonic phantoms was easy for him as Jacques tried to resist them over and over again...</p>

  <p>Jacques was so adamant about wanting to win the battle with his all-conquering white bone armor that Luo Luo Zheng decided to be patient. There was no time limit for battles on the competition field. Even if Jacques fought the demonic phantoms again and again for a year, Luo Luo Zheng would still wait patiently.</p>

  <p>After being at it for more than ten minutes, Jacques finally realized that he was acting like a fool. He was well-shielded with the white bone armor, but he could feel the disciples at the sidelines muttering disparagingly as if he was an idiot.</p>

  <p>It was meaningless to bother with Luo Zheng's demonic phantoms.</p>

  <p>Jacques straightened up, finally thinking clearly. He suddenly doubled up his speed. Making a detour around the demonic phantoms, he moved to attack Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You've finally stopped mucking around?" Seeing Jacques approach, Luo Luo Zheng smiled faintly. He too sped up, but not to escape. To Jacques's amazement, Luo Luo Zheng dashed into his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Am I seeing this correctly?" one of the disciples in the crowd wondered out loud. "Luo Luo Zheng plans to confront the tough armor with the strength of his body?"</p>

  <p>"Jacques is wearing the white bone armor, that means he is hidden behind a brilliant defense shield," someone said. "Nothing except a fairy weapon can break into his armor. Luo Luo Zheng is not using his sword. He wants to use his physical body. That's why he is slamming into Jacques."</p>

  <p>"Are you serious? Jacques is like a human-shaped chariot. He can crush opponents with the white bone armor alone. I accept that Luo Luo Zheng has an innate superhuman strength and that his body is tough, but how can he survive running into Jacques's shield?"</p>

  <p>Jacques too seemed stunned and curious, but then his face shifted to show glee. He had been afraid that Luo Luo Zheng would play a kind of guerrilla war with him. If Luo Luo Zheng had dodged him at first and then kept evading him, it would be difficult for Jacques to attack him. However, this guy didn't run away. Instead, he dashed at Jacques? 'Is he insane?' Jacques wondered. 'Fine, as you wish. I will disable you, so that nobody would dare compare you with me again!'</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to bump into each other, the dragon scales in Luo Zheng's mind lit up.</p>
