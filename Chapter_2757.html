<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2757 Black Eyes </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Mathew was most proud of this sword. He was certain that among all of the divine land's treasures, it would rank in the top ten in terms of strength.</p>

  <p>However, to Mathew's surprise, the moment it came into contact with the Shadow Bearing Sword, it disintegrated as if it was made of sand. 'What... is happening?' he thought bewildered. He could not believe what he was seeing.</p>

  <p>His Invisible Incantation Sword vanished into thin air, while Luo Zheng's sword landed on the ground with so much force that it caused a mild tremor!</p>

  <p>Mathew was unable to make use of the Grand Teleportation technique and being at such a close proximity to Luo Zheng, he was convinced that he would die.</p>

  <p>In a battle between powerhouses, one wrong judgment could lead to an excruciating death. Luo Zheng needed to seize this unique opportunity to defeat his opponent.</p>

  <p>When the Shadow Bearing Sword reached Mathew's head, Jayden's snake spear, which was not far away, zoomed towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Jayden was quite surprised to see that Luo Zheng was actually about to defeat Mathew.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't just stand by and watch as Mathew was beheaded by Luo Zheng. He directly attacked Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>He did not intend to kill Luo Zheng, but he wanted to obstruct him!</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>A pure and vigorous force shot out from the snake spear.</p>

  <p>As the Demi-holy Being of the Dongfang Clan, Jayden was stronger than an ordinary Demi-holy Being!</p>

  <p>In terms of fighting, the Demi-holy Beings of the Liu Clan and the Xie Clan might not be able to defeat him.</p>

  <p>However, he was only a Demi-holy Being and not a Holy Being. So he could not build the universe or revive infinitely.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brows furrowed slightly when he faced the formidable attack from Jayden.</p>

  <p>If he insisted on killing Mathew, it was likely that the snake spear would pierce his body and he would at least be seriously injured!</p>

  <p>He abruptly twisted his body to deflect!</p>

  <p>"Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body flew up and down like a piece of paper, pressing close to the snake spear. He finally swung his sword and slashed at Jayden.</p>

  <p>"Perfect timing!"</p>

  <p>With a loud growl, Jayden suddenly raised his snake spear.</p>

  <p>Layers of internal momentum appeared on the snake spear, especially on its tip. A faint blood texture was also visible.</p>

  <p>"Murdering Divine Dao!"</p>

  <p>"Flying Ghost Stab!"</p>

  <p>An extremely strong killing intent spread out and surrounded Luo Zheng completely.</p>

  <p>Then, Jayden's snake spear dashed towards Luo Zheng like a rocket. In the blink of an eye, the snake spear stabbed him nonstop and left a shadow every time.</p>

  <p>It looked like a bunch of bloody flowers blooming in his hand!</p>

  <p>But none of the spear strikes hurt Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Eight Smoky Melodies combined with the Truth of Cultivation Nature was a miraculous skill. Luo Zheng's body was able to dodge the snake spear every single time it was about to pierce him. He was saved in the nick of time, every time!</p>

  <p>"Interesting!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body movement skills were fantastic but his opponent was a top-level Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>After the attack failed, Jayden figured out another way to deal with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He calmly and deliberately drew back his snake spear.</p>

  <p>This time, his snake spear didn't stab Luo Zheng, but instead it jabbed all around with Luo Zheng in the center.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body movement skills were exquisite, but it was still only the ordinary Eight Smoky Melodies. And he had just fused it with the Truth of Divine Dao, making it a bit magical.</p>

  <p>But this body movement skill had a fatal disadvantage? it could only borrow the power of others to dodge!</p>

  <p>Once Jayden figured out this disadvantage, he changed his tactic and began slashing with the snake spear around Luo Zheng, restricting his movements to a small radius!</p>

  <p>"Mathew! This guy has nowhere to dodge. You can attack now!" Jayden said to Mathew, gesturing with his snake spear.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for Jayden's aid, Mathew might have been cut in half by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Are you only relying on the incomparable power and unpredictable body movement skill?" A contemptuous smile appeared once again on Mathew's mouth. "Among the consummate True Gods, you are indeed outstanding!</p>

  <p>But how did you think you could defeat us only by these methods?"</p>

  <p>So every time Jayden's snake spear came at Luo Zheng, his body trembled a bit, but it couldn't move out of Jayden's range of control.</p>

  <p>Even as he was busy fighting, Luo Zheng replied defiantly, "Yes, so what?"</p>

  <p>"Then you underestimate us..."</p>

  <p>Mathew raised his arm again and the golden runes that were scattered everywhere swirled around again, clinging and condensing. They once again turned into the Invisible Incantation Sword.</p>

  <p>As Mathew pointed at the golden sword with his finger, a stronger Divine Dao internal momentum emanated from it and it vibrated!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A dazzling golden light burst forth, as if a star was born out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>The dark water area lived up to its name. It was the darkest, gloomiest place ever, but at this moment, those areas within a radius of ten miles were illuminated as if it was daytime.</p>

  <p>"I also possess powerful strength, and the difference between me and the Holy Beings is that the Holy Beings have an immortal body. However, in terms of strength only, few Holy Beings can defeat me!" Mathew proclaimed coldly.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings' bodies were connected with the universes to produce immortal bodies.</p>

  <p>The Demi-holy Beings yearned for this ability all the time. No matter how powerful the Demi-holy Being was, there was only one chance for them to live. However, if a Holy Being was killed or died, they could be revived again.</p>

  <p>Their abilities decided the value of their lives!</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Mathew lifted his sword gently and the golden light shifted along the sword, as if the golden star on the sword was also under his control.</p>

  <p>"If that's all you have to rely on, then go ahead and get killed," said Mathew indifferently.</p>

  <p>Nicholas had ordered them to chase Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If he could get caught alive, it would be great. But if they failed to do that, then they were given orders to directly kill him.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Mathew didn't want to leave Luo Zheng alive. He thrust his sword at Luo Zheng without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Golden Destruction Strike!"</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The blinding golden star light went straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This sword attack is very powerful, but it can't kill me. Can I make such a judgment using the Latent token?"</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng was still chatting with No. 9527 at leisure.</p>

  <p>In addition to the Killing Intent Counterattack, he also had another Latent token in his mind? the Wind Cloud Escape.</p>

  <p>When he faced a death threat, this Latent token would move him to a safe distance to avoid danger.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was also curious to know how the Latent token could distinguish between danger and safety. Could the Latent token really make its own judgments?</p>

  <p>"I guess you can," No. 9527 replied. "It's not difficult for the Latent token to make it."</p>

  <p>Now that the Wind Cloud Escape wasn't working, Luo Zheng naturally felt that even though the dazzling star light was powerful, he might be able to withstand it!</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also raised his hand and held the Shadow Bearing Sword horizontally against his chest.</p>

  <p>The emotion in his eyes disappeared in an instant, and a cold temperament arose between his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Emotion Closing Divine Dao!"</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng issued the command, a pair of dark eyes peeped out from under the dark water, observing all of this.</p>

  <p>No matter how fierce the fight was, the eyes were abnormally calm, and remained indifferent to the entire affair.</p>

  <p>However, when Luo Zheng employed the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, the black eyes narrowed sharply in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"Emotion Closing Divine Dao... How can it be? Is this Divine Dao already allowed in the divine land?"</p>
