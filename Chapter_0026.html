  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Hum, despite being at the organ refining level, you are physically hard.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, you are going to die here today. I will refine your body when you die to compensate for my losses!" said Evil Lan. With these words, he swooped toward Luo Luo Zheng with a burst of shadows.</p>

  <p>"Ping!" The sword cut Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Another incision was seen on him. A moment later, blood gushed from Luo Zheng's wound.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bump!"</p>

  <p>Every time Evil Lan attacked him, a terrible wound could be seen on Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The situation was disheartening for Luo Luo Zheng. Although he was physically strong, he was not as fast as Evil Lan. With the advantage of speed on Evil Lan's side, Luo Luo Zheng felt that there was a very real chance that Evil Lan might kill him.</p>

  <p>In this case, he had no choice but to take a risk!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Luo Luo Zheng closed his eyes, and his arms fell to his sides. It seemed as though he had been defeated.</p>

  <p>Since he couldn't catch Evil Lan, it was useless to keep trying.</p>

  <p>"Giving up so soon, poor young man?" Evil Lan said contemptuously. Evil Lan was battle-hardened. When he saw that Luo Luo Zheng had given up resisting, he raised an eyebrow. He knew better than to drop his guard for even a second.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, he continued to slash Luo Luo Zheng at very high speed. Two more wounds were seen on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Hey, hey, let me see what else can you endure!" Evil Lan continued.</p>

  <p>His shrill laugh echoed off the walls as he lunged at Luo Luo Zheng again. This time he seemed to slash at Luo Luo Zheng one more time. Just as he neared Luo Luo Zheng, Evil Lan changed direction and went round to Luo Zheng's back. Then his hands burst with blossoming lotus fire.</p>

  <p>With another shrill laugh, Evil Lan approached Luo Luo Zheng again. This time, he aimed for Luo Zheng's head. He was going to rip Luo Zheng's head off!</p>

  <p>'The right time is coming!' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>When Evil Lan was only seconds' away, Luo Luo Zheng suddenly opened his eyes. He had been patiently waiting for this opportunity. Before Evil Lan could land his attack, Luo Luo Zheng covered his head with his arms.</p>

  <p>The moment Evil Lan touched Luo Zheng's arms, the young man grasped and squeezed Evil Lan's arms. At the same time, he firmly clasped Evil Lan's skinny arms. After that, Luo Luo Zheng shouted,"Get off my back!"</p>

  <p>"Bump!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng threw Evil Lan to the ground with all of his strength. Although the cave was made up of hard stone, it could not withstand this enormous momentum. Under the impact of the explosion, the ground was torn apart, and in the middle of the huge hole lay Evil Lan.</p>

  <p>Dazed, Evil Lan took a moment to compose himself before struggling to climb out of the hole. Luo Luo Zheng, however, simply did not give him the opportunity. 'This crazy man is very strong and fast. If I let him climb out of this hole, I may not be able to catch him again. Opportunity knocks only once! I can't give him a chance.' Luo Luo Zheng rationalized.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was like a mad beast. He squatted over Evil Lan and unleashed at least a dozen punches in quick succession. The strength of each punch thrown by Luo Luo Zheng weighed about thousands of pounds.</p>

  <p>He panted from the exertion. After wiping his brow, Luo Luo Zheng looked at Evil Lan who was lying in the rubble in the hole. Luo Luo Zheng narrowed his eyes when he felt as though Evil Lan was no longer breathing.</p>

  <p>He had beaten someone who was half-way to mastering the nature level?</p>

  <p>Considering that Luo Luo Zheng only had the strength of a person at the organ refining level, this was undoubtedly a very difficult feat.</p>

  <p>Evil Lan had depleted the fire inside his body, as he had been refining for nearly a day and a night. And then, he had been attacked by Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In this case, he had still counterattacked successfully. If Luo Luo Zheng reacted a little slower, his neck would have been broken by Evil Lan. In that case, Luo Luo Zheng would have died, not Evil Lan.</p>

  <p>Life was so unpredictable! It was impossible to figure out when and where disaster would strike.</p>

  <p>It took a moment for the development to sink in. Luo Luo Zheng had just defeated a notorious nature level master, with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng congratulated himself before calming down. He needed to check the eight living people pinned to the weapon refining furnace. When Luo Luo Zheng began walking toward them, it looked like they were dead. It almost seemed as though their flesh and blood had been sucked away from their bones.</p>

  <p>When he went to investigate the iron cages closer, Luo Luo Zheng saw that those people had been burned to death by Evil Lan's fire. Their bodies looked so horrible that Luo Luo Zheng closed his eyes and turned away. 'Poor people!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng silently mourned for the people in his heart. After composing himself, Luo Luo Zheng began wandering around the vast cave. Although he had examined the cave twice now, he saw nothing of value except some broken copper and iron.</p>

  <p>Now in the center of the cave, Luo Luo Zheng frowned as he thought about what he had found. If a general weapon refiner was wealthy, then an established weapon refiner like Evil Lan could not be so poor. There must be some treasures!</p>

  <p>After searching for a while longer, a thought occurred to Luo Luo Zheng. He rushed to the hole and dragged Evil Lan's body out. Evil Lan's body had now become a skeleton. There was not a single part of the body that was left intact.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze fell on Evil Lan's right hand. On the middle finger was a black ring.</p>

  <p>An idea spurred Luo Luo Zheng to reach for the ring from Evil Lan's middle finger.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as Luo Luo Zheng touched the ring, a sense of coolness enveloped his fingers.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, this was a space ring!.</p>
