  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Zelda, who do you think is he?" asked Luther, who held the scroll in his hand. The air between them was quiet for a while.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't seem to belong to our world," Zelda said lightly after a moment of thought.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't belong to our world?" Confusion marred Luther's face and he asked, "Is there any other world?"</p>

  <p>Zelda raised her head and looked at the foggy skies outside the thatched hut. "Yes, of course. It is said that our ancestors all came from the deep sky, an extremely high place. It is called the Source World. And we are the descendants of a group of people who have been exiled from that world," she answered.</p>

  <p>She gazed at their surroundings, only to be greeted by the sight of thick brown clouds and mists? the chaotic energy once again.</p>

  <p>"Is he? from the Source World?" Luther asked as his eyes glittered strangely.</p>

  <p>A smile made its way to Zelda's lips. "I was just guessing! You should concentrate on your practice. Besides, Luo Zheng has such powerful techniques to become a True God. If you have the chance to return to your clan in the future, maybe you can defend yourself with your strength of a True God."</p>

  <p>Luther pursed his lips and continued to study the scroll in his hand. The methods recorded in it made him itch to give it a try and want to create a Soul Sea of his own.</p>

  <p>Just then, they heard a noise outside the thatched hut. Both of them instinctively looked outside at the same time, and saw Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You're back," said Zelda with a gentle smile on her face.</p>

  <p>"How was your harvest? You haven't got any wild bones, have you?"</p>

  <p>Luther remarked. The hint of dissatisfaction on his face betrayed his attempt to keep cool. Although he was not a Wild God, he had rich experience in distinguishing the locations of wild bones. He thought that Luo Zheng would probably get nothing after he went to the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw how Luther looked at him, he didn't say anything and went straight into the thatched hut.</p>

  <p>"The shape of a wild bone is similar to an ordinary skeleton. It's indeed difficult to find it. Hundreds of people in the tribe only find a few pieces by luck within a month. There's actually no need to worry," Zelda said slowly.</p>

  <p>"I asked you to take me with you. No wonder you got no harvest,"</p>

  <p>Luther complained with a pout.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he sat down cross-legged and smiled at the two. Then, he extended his hand and waved slightly.</p>

  <p>A neat row of wild bones appeared in front of him!</p>

  <p>Both Luther's and Zelda's jaws dropped in surprise, especially Luther's.</p>

  <p>He ogled at Luo Zheng and the bones, and then counted, "One, two, three, four? Twelve! And these ones are extremely large!"</p>

  <p>Back then, he had risked his life and had almost gotten himself killed in the Immemorial Wilderness, only to find three wild bones. He didn't expect that Luo Zheng could find so many wild bones in a day, which he honestly found a bit unacceptable.</p>

  <p>Even Zelda, who had always been calm, eyed the wild bones with much eagerness as well.</p>

  <p>Although the tribe had made a few pieces of wild bones every month, it was the whole tribe's property? which was why Zelda couldn't use them without permission. Thus, she had been running low of wild bones.</p>

  <p>Luther had risked his life to get two pieces of wild bones for her. She did get mad at him for such a hazardous move, but it still made her very happy. After all, they were too precious to her.</p>

  <p>While the two's shock hadn't wavered off yet, Luo Zheng gently waved his hand again and in front of them appeared another dozen wild bones.</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>"..."</p>

  <p>Luther and Zelda couldn't even speak. Was it possible to be even more shocked than they were?</p>

  <p>Without warning, Luo Zheng moved his hand again and another dozen wild bones appeared.</p>

  <p>He kept waving his hand, and rows upon rows of wild bones were laid in front of their eyes.</p>

  <p>If Zelda and Luther were immensely surprised at the beginning, now they felt almost numb with shock.</p>

  <p>"There, there... there are eighty-nine pieces in total," Zelda whispered as she eyed the wild bones. They emitted a power that greatly attracted her to them.</p>

  <p>Even Luther stared at Luo Zheng in a daze before he asked, "Did you search through the whole Immemorial Wilderness?"</p>

  <p>The area where they stayed was the most barren spot in the Immemorial Wilderness. Numerous people had screened the area countless times, so there were only a few wild bones in the place.</p>

  <p>Once the powerful Wild Gods had deemed it no longer worth searching for wild bones, it was the tribe people's turn to look in this place.</p>

  <p>They were occasionally lucky enough to find one or two pieces of wild bones.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, found almost a hundred wild bones in a day. It was simply unbelievable!</p>

  <p>If those large sects knew about it, they would probably take the whole area back.</p>

  <p>"How did you make it?" Zelda asked. Her shock, however only lasted for a while.</p>

  <p>After all, she wasn't someone who was new and inexperienced.</p>

  <p>She wouldn't have been impressed by tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of wild bones if she was back home, let alone less than one hundred wild bones. After all, it was really nothing to the truly powerful Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>Then again, things would've been so different if a multitude of wild bones had been dug out of this barren land.</p>

  <p>"I'm lucky," Luo Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>Luther rolled his eyes at him. "Only idiots believe in luck!" he snapped.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he would be considered lucky if he had found two or three, or seven or eight wild bones. Yet, not even a child would believe that he found eighty-nine wild bones because of his good fortune.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng didn't give them a further explanation. He gently pushed twelve wild bones and gave them to Zelda. "These wild bones are for you. You also need to practice," he said.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng also badly needed wild bones to cultivate, it wasn't too hard to find them. He had just arrived in their area and thanks to Zelda, he had a temporary shelter. Thus, he would like to share the wild bones with her.</p>

  <p>"You... You're giving all of these to me?" Zelda asked excitedly. She did need wild bones to overcome her bottleneck, but she knew very well their value.</p>

  <p>She would have been very happy already if Luo Zheng gave her two or three pieces.</p>

  <p>She even thought that she didn't deserve to have twelve wild bones, but she also didn't want to refuse.</p>

  <p>On one hand, Luther had originally planned to tease Luo Zheng and ask him to send some pieces of wild bones to Zelda. When he saw how generous Luo Zheng was, he felt too embarrassed to say anything else.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have a special wild bone that I'd like you to look at," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Zelda was a little puzzled, and then asked again, "There's another piece of wild bone?"</p>

  <p>The space ring on Luo Zheng's finger glowed once more. A triangular bone that was as tall as a man, landed on the ground with such a loud thud that the entire thatched hut trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>There in front of them, stood the blood-red wild bone.</p>

  <p>This time, Zelda was completely, utterly dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>She was stunned to silence for a long while and when she finally came to her senses, she quickly urged, "Put it away! Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Zheng asked curiously. He was quite confused, but nevertheless tucked the blood-red wild bone away into the space ring.</p>

  <p>In turn, Zelda went to the thatched hut's entrance door and carefully scanned the outside. Then, she closed the door and said, "If someone else saw that wild bone, you will be in big trouble..."</p>

  <p>It was true that the tribe people relied greatly on Zelda, but it didn't mean that they were a trustworthy bunch. If they ever knew that Luo Zheng had such a wild bone, they would be more than glad to sell the news to outsiders.</p>
