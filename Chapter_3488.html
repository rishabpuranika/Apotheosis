<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's voice was not loud, but what he said came as a shock to the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>It was too much for her.</p>

  <p>While Zheng could probably fabricate a story about the second Other Shore, she believed the part about the void construction of the Truth of Three-Energy Construction.</p>

  <p>"Outside the chaos? What is outside the chaos?" The Snake Goddess stared at Zheng intently, like a child hungry for knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Well..." Zheng hesitated slightly.</p>

  <p>"Can't you tell me?" Noticing Zheng's hesitation, the Snake Goddess couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I can." Zheng smiled. King Manard didn't give Zheng too many restrictions. His only request was to help him find the humans on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Zheng thought it wouldn't hurt to inform the Snake Goddess. "The world outside the chaos is very unique. There, the shapes of all materials are different... It's hard to describe..."</p>

  <p>Zheng did his best to describe the scene engraved in his memory.</p>

  <p>Although the description was not, in his opinion, exactly accurate, the Snake Goddess still lapped up everything he said. Even Yan, who was standing next to her, listened attentively to her brother's story.</p>

  <p>By the time Zheng finished speaking, the Snake Goddess seemed to want to say something.</p>

  <p>However, a voice interrupted her. "Since you said that space is another Other Shore, can one go there with the Truth of Three-Energy Construction?"</p>

  <p>A burly figure appeared on the jadeite platform. It was Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you were eavesdropping!" Yan said accusingly.</p>

  <p>"Eavesdropping? What do you mean by that?" Fuxi chuckled. "I've been here this whole time."</p>

  <p>It was clear that Fuxi had heard every word that had come out of Zheng's mouth just now. He too was curious about that space and the world outside the chaos, so he couldn't help but reveal himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng, contrary to his sister's reaction, smiled calmly at Fuxi. "Yes. With the Truth of Three-Energy Construction, we can go there."</p>

  <p>"With the soul or body?" Fuxi asked, eyebrow raised.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that either." Zheng was baffled by this question.</p>

  <p>Since returning from that space, he had never tried going back to it.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to enter the Other Shore with the Truth of Powerful Holy Body or the corporeal body. That space, on the other hand, was an Other Shore built by King Manard, so there should be no such restriction.</p>

  <p>"So, what price do I have to pay for getting the Truth of Three-Energy Construction?" Fuxi asked, taking a step forward.</p>

  <p>He and the Snake Goddess had been searching for the humans on the Other Shore for countless years. King Manard was the first one they had ever heard of. Of course, he wanted to see him.</p>

  <p>But the Truth of Three-Energy Construction was in Zheng's hands. They naturally wouldn't force him to give it.</p>

  <p>"Price?" Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>He didn't intend to get anything by giving the Truth of Three-Energy Construction. But he had never forgotten his mission, also Chiyou's last will, to rebuild the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>He had asked Eastern Emperor Taiyi to give him a promise by offering him the Truth Enlightenment, but now, the Oneness Sky Palace was still being suppressed by the Bearing race. Especially after his identity was exposed, it was still uncertain what lengths the Bearing race would go to.</p>

  <p>With only the Oneness Sky Palace, he might find it difficult to fight against super forces such as the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race and the Sun Crow race.</p>

  <p>Since the Human Sovereign said so...</p>

  <p>"I have one request," Zheng said slowly. "I want you to help me rebuild the Nine Li race."</p>

  <p>Yan stared at her brother, dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>She had been living blissfully in the Pear Hill this whole time, but she knew her brother bore a heavy burden.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's and the Snake Goddess's expressions remained unchanged. They knew Zheng's background, and had predicted he would make such a request.</p>

  <p>Expectantly eyeing the two supreme masters before him, Zheng maintained his calm disposition. He had a feeling they would accept his request.</p>

  <p>"I can't make any promises," the Snake Goddess said bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Zheng was surprised.</p>

  <p>"Because we can't help you do what you want," answered the Snake Goddess, casting a glance downward. Unsure how to console Zheng, she couldn't look him in the eye at this time.</p>

  <p>"But..." Zheng was puzzled. "If you join forces with the Oneness Sky Palace, it's possible!"</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's anxious expression, the Snake Goddess smiled gently. "Have you ever thought about the process of rebuilding the Nine Li race? Gather all the remaining members of the Nine Li race and multiply. Then, a strong warrior from it would lead the Nine Li race to become one of the super forces in the Source World. Is that what you want?"</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at her blankly. He was speechless.</p>

  <p>"The Chaotic Source World is gone," said the Snake Goddess, her eyes shining brightly. "From here on out, it will be impossible to cultivate a warrior at the Chaotic Source Realm. You secretly took crystals of the Chaotic Source Spirits from the Chaotic Source World. After giving one portion of them to the head of the Rose Sect, you have only nine left. Do you intend to cultivate the Nine Li people with these crystals?"</p>

  <p>It was impossible to bring the crystals of Chaotic Source Spirits out of the Chaotic Source World. The Pear Hill was very clear that Zheng had taken out two thousand.</p>

  <p>Zheng fell silent, his mind whirling.</p>

  <p>He had always envisioned rebuilding the Nine Li race, but only now did he realize he never really thought about the steps to get there.</p>

  <p>Taking the threshold of the Chaotic Source Realm into consideration, there was really no way he could achieve his goal.</p>

  <p>"Snake Goddess, is there really no hope of rebuilding the Nine Li race?"</p>

  <p>Yan asked, blinking. Disappointment was written all over her face.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess walked over to Yan and threw her arms around her in a warm hug. Seeing Yan as her own daughter, she was fond of the girl. "There is hope, but your brother has mistaken the order."</p>

  <p>"What order?" Yan asked confusedly.</p>

  <p>"It's meaningless to rebuild the Nine Li race if the Finale Way is not completed," the Snake Goddess answered. "The chaos will be destroyed.</p>

  <p>And all the humans, including those from the Pear Hill, the Oneness Sky Palace and the Bearing race, will perish." Turning to face Zheng, she continued explaining to Yan, "But if your brother completes the Finale Way, it will be much easier to rebuild the Nine Li race, right?"</p>

  <p>Upon returning to Pear Hill, Fuxi had filled the Snake Goddess in on all the details about what happened at the bottom of the chaos. She was keenly aware that Zheng was selected by Gerald.</p>

  <p>Contrary to the aggrieved Fuxi at the time, the Snake Goddess's reaction was quite calm.</p>

  <p>She did not know why Zheng was chosen by Gerald, but as one of the six Chaos Ancient Gods, Gerald undoubtedly should have unique insight.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Zheng could really complete the Finale Way and become the supreme Finale Hero in the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Do you know your goal now?" Fuxi asked viciously.</p>

  <p>When he left that prison, Fuxi had felt so indignant. He thought Gerald was blind to have chosen Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, when he met Zheng again in the Chaotic Source World, Zheng had completely changed. He had rapidly improved.</p>

  <p>At least, Zheng's performance had convinced Fuxi and made him certain of what he believed in.</p>
