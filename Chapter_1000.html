<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There were only three people in front of Luo Zheng— Tianming, Patrick and Lewis. Tianming was a swordsman, and he definitely wouldn't be able to use the pair of short swords. Patrick, on the other hand, didn't use a sword at all.</p>

  <p>The only person who was suitable to use the pair of short swords was Lewis.</p>

  <p>So how could he not be excited when he saw the pair of short swords?</p>

  <p>Lewis was proudest of his movement skill. However, since his cultivation level was low, his movement skill could only be regarded as a method to run for his life if needed.</p>

  <p>Possessing a pair of short swords like this would make up for his shortcoming in attack.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled lightly and nodded towards Lewis.</p>

  <p>Lewis' hands stretched out like lightning, and even before Luo Zheng had the opportunity to give the short swords to him, Lewis had taken them away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Patrick were amused by this reaction, while Tianming cast a reproachful glance at Lewis.</p>

  <p>Patrick was the most composed out of them. He just wore a gentle smile on his face. His cultivation method was mainly focused on Buddhism.</p>

  <p>Back in the Cloud Sect, he was even more powerful than Tianming.</p>

  <p>However, the Buddhist legacy was not flourishing. The famous Enlightened Heart Temple was barely a third-grade sect. Patrick could only rely on his comprehension to cultivate and because of that, his cultivation progress became slower than Tianming's.</p>

  <p>Also because of his cultivation method, Patrick did not use a weapon.</p>

  <p>Because of that, what Luo Zheng had prepared for him was a defensive treasure, which was a low-grade sacred weapon. This defensive treasure, when paired with his Body in the Diamond-like State, would allow his defensive power to reach an extremely terrifying level.</p>

  <p>However, even if each of them had a low-grade sacred weapon, they wouldn't dare to use it in front of others.</p>

  <p>The Central Region was unlike the Sea God Continent. It lacked sacred weapons. Only warriors at the Life and Death Realm or at the late stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm were qualified to possess sacred weapons. And if they were to carry out missions with these sacred weapons, then the primary target of people with bad intentions would most likely be them.</p>

  <p>While the four of them gathered at where they were, a beautiful woman slowly descended to Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had left Mu Ning in Fire City before he went to Cloudy City. She hesitated for a long while before she finally decided to look for him.</p>

  <p>She looked soft, like a woman who had never experienced anything hard in her life. Moreover, she didn't look like a warrior at all. But then, it was true that she didn't know much about the rules in the world of warriors, and because of that, she was frequently targeted by a lot of warriors.</p>

  <p>If Mu Ning was still the old her, it would have been almost impossible for her to safely reach Cloudy City. But after she fully activated her Purple Power Body, her strength became extremely high.</p>

  <p>The warriors who had set their eyes on Mu Ning were out of luck.</p>

  <p>Originally, they thought she was a weak woman, and even if she had a cultivation at the Internal Elixir Realm, they could still deal with her easily. However, to their surprise, she could summon hundreds of huge swords at the same time, which would cut them into minced meat before they could lament their bad luck.</p>

  <p>The most exaggerated part of her story happened just the day before when she passed through Goose City.</p>

  <p>Goose City was originally a very small city. There wasn't even a single sect in its surrounding area.</p>

  <p>For the past two years, the situation in the Central Region had been very chaotic. As some independent warriors were unwilling to join any big sect or the Heavenly Evil Sect, they started occupying a few small cities and even started forming their own sects. It was just that these small sects were not recognized by the big sects in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Because these independent warriors didn't have to obey the constraints of the large sects, the majority of them weren't good people. Rather than call Goose City a city, it was more accurate to say that it had turned into a nest of bandits, a home for people who robbed warriors passing by.</p>

  <p>If this was in the past, there would naturally be a fourth-grade or even a fifth-grade sect that would come forward and exterminate them. With the strength of Cloud Hall or the Ethereal Spirit Sect, exterminating these bandits should only be a simple task. But as these large sects were now busy enough with their own affairs, they unfortunately didn't have time to do so.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning happened to need to pass by Goose City. Knowing it was a small city, she was prepared to rest for a while before continuing on her journey to Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>Just like before, wherever she went, there were people eyeing her.</p>

  <p>Throughout her journey through the city, she had already beheaded dozens of independent warriors from Goose City who were trying something with her.</p>

  <p>After killing these independent warriors, Mu Ning decided that she had to leave in a hurry. Although she had killed many people on her way here, she was still not used to this kind of massacre. Everyone said that the world of warriors was cruel, and she herself knew that, but after experiencing it for herself, she understood that this cruelty was almost unbearable.</p>

  <p>But little did Mu Ning know that she had brought herself great trouble after killing those warriors. Most of the people in this city were independent warriors. After hearing the commotion, they all rushed over, one by one. Seeing that more and more people were surrounding her, Mu Ning had no choice but to summon a million huge swords.</p>

  <p>When a single huge sword was summoned, the power was already so overwhelming. Summoning a million huge swords would be great enough to annihilate the entire city. With over a million swords suddenly slashing people down, the power was almost unimaginable.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the entire Goose City had been wiped out by the great swords she had summoned. Tens of thousands of independent warriors had also been wiped out as well.</p>

  <p>The owner of Purple Power Body truly did have the power to wipe out the world.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Mu Ning herself was frightened. After seeing what she had done, she staggered out of Goose City and sprinted towards Cloudy City. Since her flying speed was still too slow, it was only now that she was able to arrive at Cloudy City.</p>

  <p>The moment she arrived at the gates of Cloudy City, she hesitated to enter. She could not understand why every warrior had wanted to do something to her.</p>

  <p>After looking around, Mu Ning found Cloud Hall, which was floating above the city.</p>

  <p>'Luo Zheng must be in Cloud Hall right now! After all, he rushed all the way here, ' she thought. Margaret's eyes flashed as she controlled her life vitality and flew towards the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>However, just as she was flying halfway, she discovered that she seemed to have been obstructed by a transparent enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>'Is this enchanted barrier the great sect-protecting array set up by Luo Zheng?' she thought. Although Mu Ning had never left the Ethereal City before, she had heard about sect-protecting array. She knew about the various sects in the Central Region, but she lacked the necessary experience that would help her in this situation.</p>

  <p>When she thought of Luo Zheng, Mu Ning felt conflicted. Taking a deep breath, she started circling around the enchanted barrier and soon enough, she arrived at the main entrance of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>A few guards were standing at the entrance. Upon seeing that there was someone outside, one of the guards flew over and asked her in a stern voice, "Who are you? If you have nothing important to do here, hurry up and leave!"</p>

  <p>After being scolded in such a manner, Mu Ning couldn't help but feel how she had been wronged. No one, even in the Ethereal Spirit Sect, would dare to scold her like that! But ever since she left the Ethereal City, she understood that the world didn't revolve around her, and that no one would treat her like a baby anymore.</p>

  <p>She had already gone through all sorts of hardships. If she was still the same Mu Ning as before, she probably would have made the guard pay the price for how he treated her, and there would naturally be people by her side to help her out. But now, she was alone, and had nowhere to go.</p>

  <p>"I...I'm here for Luo Zheng," Mu Ning timidly replied.</p>

  <p>"Are you looking for Luo Zheng? Wait. Hasn't he disappeared for a long time?</p>

  <p>He is not here in Cloud Hall!" the guard replied.</p>

  <p>Although Cloud Hall had been in an uproar for a while, only the middle and upper echelons were involved in it. The guard was just an ordinary warrior of the Cloud Hall, and so he was completely unaware that Luo Zheng had already returned. In the past two years, there had indeed been many warriors who had come to visit Luo Zheng, including people of the Runic Tower. The guard would dismiss them with the same reason.</p>

  <p>"What? Luo Zheng is not here?" Margaret's expression changed as she frowned deeply.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng had been pursued by Eddie, he still chose to go back to Cloudy City. He had the opportunity to shake Eddie off, so no one else in the Central Region could block him. 'It is impossible that Luo Zheng hasn't returned to the Cloud Hall. This guard must be lying to me!'</p>

  <p>Mu Ning thought. Her voice suddenly turned cold as she said, "Don't lie to me. Tell Luo Zheng to come out!" In her eyes, Luo Zheng had told the guard to say that he wasn't there mainly because he didn't want to see her. But she was wrong.</p>

  <p>But, why did Mu Ning follow Luo Zheng all the way here?</p>

  <p>Although she already hated Luo Zheng to death, she was still a traditional woman. She truly believed that Luo Zheng owed her, but at the same time, she didn't know what she wanted to get from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I've already said it. Luo Zheng is missing and is not at Cloud Hall!" The guard was starting to get annoyed at Mu Ning. Even though she was at the Internal Elixir Realm, with the enchanted barrier blocking the way, he was not afraid of her at all. Even a warrior at the Life and Death Realm wouldn't be able to break the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning slowly approached the enchanted barrier. With her expression dark, she shouted, "This is the last time I'll say this. Let Luo Zheng out! Tell him to come and see me!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you crazy bitch! Go home! You're not going to see Luo Zheng here!" the guard shouted back as he turned around to return to Cloud Hall's entrance.</p>
