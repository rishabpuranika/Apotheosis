<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When Zheng and the rest looked up, their eyes fell on the four human Great Ghost Priests.</p>

  <p>At this very moment, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Fuxi were far more nervous than the others.</p>

  <p>While they had only seen the energy souls of their real selves in the past, at this moment, they had the chance to actually see their real selves in full.</p>

  <p>Had their real selves already merged with the hatred-level Treacherous Beings?</p>

  <p>Had they become Great Ghost Priests?</p>

  <p>Although they looked up with this anticipation, they were disappointed by what they saw.</p>

  <p>They saw Emperor Charm and Chiyou, but the real Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, and the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi were all absent.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng had something different in mind.</p>

  <p>Cupping his hands, he greeted with respect, "Good to see you, Primeval Lord of Heaven!"</p>

  <p>The real Primeval Lord of Heaven merely nodded nonchalantly at Zheng in return.</p>

  <p>While Zheng and the others sized up the Great Ghost Priests, the latter observed them closely as well.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi were all familiar faces to the Primeval Lord of Heaven— Zheng was the only unfamiliar face.</p>

  <p>Initially, he surmised that the group before him must have reached this point to enter the Night View Island under Fuxi and the Snake Goddess' leadership. He knew Fuxi had excellent talent and was a natural leader, while the Snake Goddess possessed extraordinary intelligence and could easily serve as a capable assistant.</p>

  <p>But looking everyone up and down, the Primeval Lord of Heaven could sense something unknown yet unique from Zheng in particular.</p>

  <p>His body seemed to have a mixed aura of bloodlines.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had spent countless years studying the bloodline powers, trying to merge them.</p>

  <p>His sensitivity to the bloodlines of Eternal Realm warriors had surpassed anyone else's.</p>

  <p>Recognizing the mixed aura of bloodlines in Zheng's body, the Primeval Lord of Heaven quickly reached a conclusion. 'Perhaps this person fused with an origin-level bloodline?' he thought.</p>

  <p>If such was the case…</p>

  <p>Then this person's bloodline would be just enough to serve as one of the wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>"Are you Zheng?" asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Earlier, when Decker reported to Emperor Charm, he had mentioned a new name to them.</p>

  <p>A total of five humans had arrived. Apart from Yasamin, the old lady with greying hair, and the three familiar faces who were replicas of their real selves, the young man must be Zheng from the earlier report, the Primeval Lord of Heaven figured.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"Okay, come up to me now."</p>

  <p>He had been living in the Ghost Mountain for many years. While he wasn't as superior as the monkeys, they still needed his help, and had to show utmost respect for his words.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven! Have you forgotten me, my old friend?" suddenly, the Eye Spirit chimed in.</p>

  <p>It was no surprise— the Primeval Lord of Heaven had already noticed the Eye Spirit's presence.</p>

  <p>But he refused to cast his eyes at the huge, floating eyeball until the latter spoke specifically to catch his attention.</p>

  <p>As he firmly stared at the Eye Spirit, a grave, resentful feeling rose within the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Ever since the 77th chaos, the human race had continued fighting against this enormous eyeball.</p>

  <p>After failing to complete the Finale Way, they had retreated into the Other Shore where they continued the running battle.</p>

  <p>Although they continued to fight, they suffered failure each and every time.</p>

  <p>Little by little, they were forced to retreat until the Ghost Mountain became their very last refuge.</p>

  <p>Only in this way had the Primeval Lord of Heaven managed to lead the group of human heroes to survive.</p>

  <p>Countless years had passed since he last saw the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>The extended span of time should have been enough for an ordinary mortal to reincarnate hundreds of millions of times— it should have been enough to blunt any deep hatred. But even now, the Primeval Lord of Heaven could still barely conceal the killing intent in his eyes. "You've been trying so hard to enter the Night View Island, haven't you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not really, you're just a group of nobodies now," said the Eye Spirit ever so casually.</p>

  <p>While he didn't mean to deliberately belittle the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others, he was, if anything, merely telling the truth.</p>

  <p>In the past, the battle between the Element Spirit Civilization and the human race was a battle between two civilizations of the chaos. It didn't involve the Treacherous Beings, nor did it involve the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>Neither of them were aware of the Four Spirits Sect's existence at the time.</p>

  <p>But now, the war between the Element Spirit Civilization and the Nihility race was different. On the surface, it was a war between the Purge Way and the Nihility Way, but in truth, it was a war between the Bird Spirit Sect and the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>In comparison to that, the human race wasn't even worth mentioning.</p>

  <p>Still, the Primeval Lord of Heaven managed to keep his cool upon hearing the Eye Spirit's words. Emperor Charm, however, couldn't suppress his anger.</p>

  <p>His eyes turned a deep golden color, as though they held fiery suns within them.</p>

  <p>Then, a powerful aura began spreading out in the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>Such was the aura of a hatred-level Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>Among the four human Great Ghost Priests, Emperor Charm had the sharpest aura.</p>

  <p>"Nobodies? What makes you say that?" he snapped back fiercely.</p>

  <p>In the face of Emperor Charm's display of strength, the corners of Claire's mouth curled up into a disdainful smile.</p>

  <p>Wearing a cunning glint in the eyeball, the Eye Spirit spoke to the Great Ghost Priests of the other races. "Since the Ghost Mountain doesn't welcome us, we'll be taking our leave now!" he said.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he turned around, ready to retreat along with Claire and the Holy Wings Armor.</p>

  <p>"Wait!"</p>

  <p>"We keep our doors open to all visitors. These humans can't represent the Ghost Mountain!"</p>

  <p>"It's up to us here!"</p>

  <p>The six Great Ghost Priests from the other races grew anxious when they saw the Eye Spirit ready to leave.</p>

  <p>After all, they had planned to stand by and watch until the cyan-skinned Great Ghost Priest proved the truth of the wolf tooth.</p>

  <p>But now, the presence of the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the other three had just further complicated the already difficult situation.</p>

  <p>The non-human Great Ghost Priests' words irritated Emperor Charm even more. Staring at one of them, he threatened coldly, "Washburn, have you already forgotten how I defeated you? You said we can't represent the Ghost Mountain. Then, what about you?"</p>

  <p>The four human Great Ghost Priests held extraordinary statuses and the greatest strength among all the priests. Washburn, the non-human Great Ghost Priest, had already been beaten by Emperor Charm seven times in the past.</p>

  <p>Noticing Emperor Charm's cold gaze, Washburn immediately grew nervous.</p>

  <p>As he was at a loss for what to say in response, another non-human Great Ghost Priest sneered and said, "Only the Ghost Master can represent the Ghost Mountain. No one else can replace him." Turning to face the Eye Spirit, he continued, "My friend, since you have the wolf teeth to wake up the Ghost Master, you are a distinguished guest of the Ghost Mountain! I believe that the Monkey Masters will wish for you to stay."</p>

  <p>"You're right. If the Monkey Masters manage to gather all the wolf teeth, I think the humans can finally stop their absurd attempts. They've tried for so long but to no avail. What a joke!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly!"</p>

  <p>As they taunted the humans, the six of them burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>Normally, they'd never have even dared to treat humans as such. But now, things were different. The passageway that led outside had finally been repaired, and the wolf teeth brought by the Eye Spirit were likely to be genuine.</p>

  <p>Even if the Eye Spirit's wolf teeth were fake, they'd be able to go and search for the lost objects themselves.</p>

  <p>After all the time spent shamefully bowing before the humans, they could finally vent their discontent.</p>

  <p>"If we wake the Ghost Master now, we'll take all humans' lives. Would you agree to that?" Claire demanded, pointing at both Zheng's and the Primeval Lord of Heaven's groups.</p>

  <p>"I believe that the Monkey Masters will agree to your small request,"</p>

  <p>Washburn nodded with a smile.</p>

  <p>When the humans heard their conversation, their expressions instantly darkened.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the Eye Spirit had been well prepared before he came to this place.</p>

  <p>While the Primeval Lord of Heaven had already fused with a hatred-level Treacherous Being, he still didn't dare underestimate the Eye Spirit.</p>

  <p>Still, never did he expect the Eye Spirit to bring the wolf teeth to the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>He was well aware that the situation was just as Washburn had said.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters bestowed a special status upon the humans in the hopes that the Primeval Lord of Heaven would manage to wake the Ghost Master, otherwise known as the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>But if the Eye Spirit awakened the Monkey Spirit King with the wolf teeth, the humans would undoubtedly become dispensable to the Monkey Masters.</p>

  <p>In such a case, the humans' value to them would shrink to nothing.</p>
