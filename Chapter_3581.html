<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The senior disciples of the Land of Sword Grief watched the arena with amusement.</p>

  <p>Zheng had challenged Cleon as soon as he reached the Land of Sword Grief.</p>

  <p>But not everyone was as powerful as Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had likewise challenged Abdul as soon as he reached the Land of Sword Grief. But judging from the aura of his Soul of Light, he hadn't even reached Stage Fourteen. He appeared to be simply arrogant.</p>

  <p>"Since it's your first time to step into the arena, I have to make some rules clear," Abdul told him, with a sneer. "You can't use the abilities of the Other Shore Tokens here. The battle is about pure strength..."</p>

  <p>The Evil God wasn't really listening to anything Abdul had to say. But he kept his temper in check and just stared at his opponent calmly.</p>

  <p>Battles usually excited the Evil God, but he had no interest in fighting a man like Abdul.</p>

  <p>"Did I make myself clear?" Abdul asked patronizingly, after running through the rules.</p>

  <p>"I have a question," the Evil God piped up.</p>

  <p>Abdul rolled his eyes. "Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"Can I use the Godly Ways here?" the Evil God asked.</p>

  <p>"Godly Ways?" Abdul was taken aback.</p>

  <p>The senior disciples were stunned into silence for a moment. They all burst out laughing in the next instant.</p>

  <p>"Does he even know what he's talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Hey, do you know what his name is on the Ranking Stone? Evil God!"</p>

  <p>"Haha! What a pompous name!"</p>

  <p>The onlookers earlier just wanted to know how much Abdul had improved, especially those ranked before him, who had felt threatened. But now, the Evil God had caught everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>Now, the audience was more interested in him.</p>

  <p>The new disciples watching, however, knew better than to consider the Evil God as just a mere oddity. They stared at him warily.</p>

  <p>They knew it was possible for him to kill Abdul instantly in a fit of anger.</p>

  <p>They wondered if he still had the same strength as before. Since Zheng dared to release him, he must even be well-prepared.</p>

  <p>The Evil God turned a deaf ear to the mockery.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you can use the Godly Ways. The arena only forbids the abilities of the Other Shore Tokens. If you want to use the Godly Ways, no one will stop you," Abdul said with a smirk.</p>

  <p>"Very well," the Evil God said with a curt nod.</p>

  <p>Abdul grinned at him cheekily. "Let's hope you learn your lesson. Next time, remember to carefully choose your opponent!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the Other Shore Token in his body began to stir. The surging Other Shore Power began to gather all over his body.</p>

  <p>Abdul didn't intend to use his full strength to teach a newcomer a lesson. He only meant to use his full strength to break through to the top ten. It would be wasted on this fellow in front of him now.</p>

  <p>"You should be glad that this is the Land of Sword Grief."</p>

  <p>Abdul launched himself at the Evil God. " After all, we're both from the Oneness Sky Palace. Don't worry. I won't disable..."</p>

  <p>The new disciples held their breath, wondering if the Evil God would use the power of the Inheritance of World. The senior disciples, meanwhile, waited for the Evil God to be sent flying through the air with broken bones and injuries all over his body.</p>

  <p>The events that unfolded, however, defied the onlookers' imagination.</p>

  <p>Abdul appeared right in front of the Evil God. Before Abdul could finish his words, a ball of energy suddenly appeared in the Evil God's hand.</p>

  <p>"Internal momentum?" Someone with sharp eyes recognized it immediately.</p>

  <p>"It seems to be a mixture of several Godly Ways, but it's not powerful," someone else said, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"But this mass of internal momentum..."</p>

  <p>Before anyone could come to a conclusion, the ball of energy exploded on Abdul.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A scorching sun bloomed in the arena.</p>

  <p>Purple energy arrows were spread within the blast, each containing overwhelming divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>Abdul never got to finish his statement. The explosion left him stunned.</p>

  <p>His flesh, blood, and bones were mutilated in the impact. The Chaotic Source Spirits in his body were suddenly drained of power. His entire body was sent flying backward, his energy continuing to be depleted.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Abdul crashed onto the side of the bronze building. He was grievously injured.</p>

  <p>It grew extremely quiet in the arena.</p>

  <p>Everyone knew the dangers of battle, but the strength gap between disciples on the first floor usually wasn't too wide. Too, all participants were protected by the Chaotic Source Spirits, so nobody expected they would be seriously injured.</p>

  <p>This was the first such serious casualty that happened in the arena.</p>

  <p>"Humph! You are as weak as an ant," the Evil God snorted. He turned and walked out of the arena.</p>

  <p>The disciples' mouths hung wide open as they watched the Evil God leave.</p>

  <p>After a long while, someone finally cried out, "Hurry up! Help Abdul!"</p>

  <p>Several senior disciples rushed over and pulled Abdul down from the wall.</p>

  <p>After someone used a skill to protect his breath of life, he was hurriedly transported away.</p>

  <p>The new disciples were left morose at the development. The Evil God was still the same. It seemed that he was controlled by Zheng, though, so he was quite restrained.</p>

  <p>If he hadn't been, Abdul would probably not be the only one injured in his attack. Everyone here would have been harmed.</p>

  <p>The Evil God walked up to Zheng. "You didn't stop me, so I went ahead and taught him a lesson."</p>

  <p>The Evil God was actually clever.</p>

  <p>He knew that Zheng wouldn't stand for him killing someone.</p>

  <p>So the Evil God left Abdul alive. At least he was punished for his arrogance.</p>

  <p>"Well done!"</p>

  <p>Zheng remarked.</p>

  <p>He had long disliked Abdul, actually. He had made such great contributions to the Land of Sword Grief, but Abdul still disliked him.</p>

  <p>Back then, his target on the first floor was Cleon, however. Abdul was not good enough to be his target.</p>

  <p>So the Evil God ended up teaching Abdul a hard lesson on his behalf.</p>

  <p>With Abdul's defeat, the Evil God rose from past one thousand to only past five hundred on the Ranking Stone.</p>

  <p>But those who had seen the Evil God's attack now understood that he was likely as powerful as Zheng. He was completely qualified to defeat all the disciples on the first floor and even the second floor.</p>

  <p>He was a ferocious fighter. Everyone's guard quietly went up. They decided to keep a low profile lest he challenge them next.</p>

  <p>After his victory, the Evil God chose to cultivate in seclusion in the cultivation room.</p>

  <p>He had just reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but his soul had yet to reach the Desire World. Only after he accomplished this could he be considered a real Chaotic Source Realm warrior.</p>
