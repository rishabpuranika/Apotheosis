<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace was among the most massive, well-equipped, and powerful of the orthodox human forces.</p>

  <p>The branches of the Oneness Sky Palace varied in strength. Some were incredibly strong, with warriors that were considered living legends by their peers. Some branches, however, were much weaker in comparison.</p>

  <p>The Sword Light Palace was perhaps the weakest of the branches of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>In contrast, over the past years some of the branches had developed so quickly that they had become at least as powerful as the Oneness Sky Palace itself. One such branch was the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace was located on Bulk Mountain, which was right next to Origin Mountain. It was said that Origin Mountain used to be the highest natural structure in the region, rising higher than Bulk Mountain; and in fact, it rose so high that it virtually blocked the sky and prevented sunlight from entering the Oneness Sky Palace. This aggravated the Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who leveled off Origin Mountain so that its height was reduced by 350, 000 feet. It was in the period after the leveling that Origin Mountain began to grow in strength and reputation.</p>

  <p>Winchell Lin was one of the most notable and outstanding warriors of Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Laura frowned, deep in thought, as memories from hundreds of years ago became clearer in her head. Finally she spoke. "I remember now. Winchell Lin isn't a Oneness Guard."</p>

  <p>As soon as Elgin and the other disciples of Sword Light Palace heard what Laura said, they were immediately disappointed, especially Elgin. He felt that the Sword Light Palace had lost all hope, and he said in an eccentric tone, "He is not even a Oneness Guard. I bet he won't be able to make it here within five years, let alone five days. When he does arrive, our flesh and bones will have turned into ashes by then. I'd rather not ask for his help!"</p>

  <p>Beldene laughed, "A person whom even Master Laura knows can't be a nobody."</p>

  <p>Laura raised her eyebrows at Elgin. She turned to Zheng and said, "Winchell Lin is not a Oneness Guard, because he is not from the main branch of the Oneness Sky Palace. Besides, with his strength, how could he possibly be a Oneness Guard?"</p>

  <p>"You mean, he's not powerful enough?" asked Ingram.</p>

  <p>Like Elgin, he looked disappointed. After all, even Ingram stood a chance of becoming a Oneness Guard if he worked hard enough. If Winchell Lin was weaker than him, then how could they count on him for any help?</p>

  <p>"That's not what I mean at all. As a matter of fact, Winchell Lin is a figure of equal status with Master Athemar. It would be far beneath his abilities to become even a five-star Oneness Guard."</p>

  <p>These words caused a strong reaction in her listeners. Ingram's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>The other disciples also looked deeply impressed.</p>

  <p>Athemar was a name they all venerated. To them, Athemar was their spiritual leader. As the founder of the Sword Light Palace, he was to be worshiped.</p>

  <p>Although Athemar had done nothing to save the Sword Light Palace in its time of peril, none of them blamed him for his inaction. It couldn't be expected that such an important figure would stay in Seven-Star City for a branch as weak as the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>Elgin murmured, "A warrior who is the equal of Athemar..."</p>

  <p>Then he scoffed. "Zheng, who are you trying to fool? Did you just give us the name of a random guy you heard of while in the Sea of Truth?"</p>

  <p>Elgin was hoping for someone to save them, but he had long been mistrustful and jealous of Zheng. His dislike of Zheng naturally led him to doubt his motives.</p>

  <p>A flash of anger appeared in Zheng's eyes. In an instant, he had grabbed Elgin by the neck with one hand, and Elgin felt the shock of a cold killing intent piercing through his body. He felt as though he had fallen into a pool of ice.</p>

  <p>His body and soul stiffened.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell do you think you are? Why would anyone bother to fool someone such as yourself? If you are determined to give up on life, then let me help you end it!" Zheng said icily. His grasp tightened.</p>

  <p>There was no question, of course, that Elgin was weaker and less talented than Zheng on every level. There was no possibility of escaping from his grip.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the other disciples would have stepped in by now. But given the stressful situation, even their two leaders? Laura and Ingram? were coolly watching the scene unfold.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning of the crisis, Elgin had been talking nonsense. He was always the first to cast doubt on an idea, the first to proclaim that the worst would happen, the first to insist that they were doomed. Everyone had grown tired of his attitude.</p>

  <p>Elgin's face grew redder and redder. Zheng was slowly suffocating him, his grip tightening on his neck as though to snap it off."</p>

  <p>"M-Master? Master Laura, please... Help me..." Elgin choked out.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe that Laura would just stand by and watch Zheng attacking him. He was the best disciple in all the cultivation palaces!</p>

  <p>Neither Laura nor Ingram moved. They looked at Zheng, wondering what he would do.</p>

  <p>Faegan, Kenelm, and the others also did not intervene. They thought that Elgin deserved it.</p>

  <p>Zheng kept tightening his grip. There was a faint sound, like a bone fracturing.</p>

  <p>Elgin, no longer able to speak, made an incoherent gasping sound.</p>

  <p>Finally, Beldene stepped forward and laid a hand on Zheng's arm. "Zheng, please go easy on Elgin. He can be difficult, but he's not a bad person. We're in great danger and we need every man available."</p>

  <p>Zheng respected Beldene, and found him in every way to be a more agreeable companion than Elgin. So he nodded.</p>

  <p>With a fierce shove, Zheng hurled Elgin onto the ground. Elgin gasped for breath and bent over, clutching his throat.</p>

  <p>He felt like his entire body had been squeezed. He collapsed on his side and lay without moving.</p>

  <p>"Watch what you say from now on," Zheng warned him.</p>

  <p>Everyone deliberately looked away from Elgin. Laura spoke up as though nothing had happened. "Zheng, I wonder... how did you meet and gain influence over someone like Winchell?"</p>

  <p>While she believed that Winchell was truly the equal of Athemar, she still felt some doubt that he would actually come and help them.</p>

  <p>Why would such a man as Winchell be persuaded to come to the Sword Light Palace?</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you all the details right now. I know that many of you are still worried, but in a few days, Winchell will arrive and all your doubts will be laid to rest," Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Zheng had never discussed with them the details of his experiences in the Sea of Truth. And he didn't plan to.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I believe you're telling us the truth. It's just that I'm not sure about Winchell himself," Laura said, slightly apologetic. "I understand,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said.</p>

  <p>For the next few days, everyone waited, feeling torn between hope that Winchell was coming, fear that he had changed his mind, and torment at their predicament.</p>

  <p>Zheng had given them hope, but it was fragile. They were very restless.</p>

  <p>The fighting seemed to have ended. More and more members of the Black Armor race had arrived. Apart from Reynald, Ibrahim of the Black Armor race was also in the place.</p>

  <p>With each day that passed, the umbrella hanging over their heads became dimmer and dimmer.</p>

  <p>The umbrella was still able to withstand the attacks from the Black Armor race, but both sides knew that the power of the Latent Theurgy wouldn't last much longer.</p>

  <p>Reynald sneered at Laura. "I thought your precious Latent Theurgy could protect you for a decent amount of time. At least ten days. But it looks like you'll be dead by tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Laura ignored him. She wore a look of complete indifference, refusing to respond to any of Reynald's taunts.</p>

  <p>"This human girl is very beautiful, isn't she, Reynald? Maybe we shouldn't kill her immediately once the Latent Theurgy is destroyed," Ibrahim said suggestively.</p>

  <p>Reynald licked his lips. "Good idea! We'll do just that."</p>

  <p>Laura maintained her indifferent demeanor. The only sign that she had heard was the faintest trace of a flush on her pale cheeks.</p>

  <p>She had already decided that once the Latent Theurgy fell, she would not choose to live and make herself vulnerable to the suffering promised by the Black Armor race. Even if she had to pay the price of burning the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a member of the Black Armor race appeared via Grand Teleportation. He spoke to Ibrahim in their strange language, apparently giving him a report of some kind.</p>
