<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2037 Rules (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I am Supreme Lord of Oracle. I am representing the human race in order to announce news. Nathan has been killed by Maha. On behalf of the human race and the Evolutionary Universe, I hope that stronger talents will come forth and stand for our revenge!"</p>

  <p>Truth be told, there was only one or two warriors in the younger generation that were stronger than Nathan. One of them was Luo Zheng, and the other was Tianming. Currently, Tianming was in closed-door seclusion, and Luo Zheng had just taken care of things with the Demon Night. There was literally nobody else they could count on.</p>

  <p>The reason she said this was in an attempt to provide comfort to the countless living beings within the Evolutionary Universe. More importantly, she tried inspiring everyone and anyone who was listening.</p>

  <p>As Supreme Lord of Oracle's cold and moving voice echoed throughout the universe, all the races and intelligent life forms across the land threw themselves into an uproar.</p>

  <p>"There's no way Nathan actually lost to that Maha!" someone exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"This Maha is truly an undefeatable existence!" someone else shouted in agreement. "Does this mean that we have to send a Supreme Lord to fight him?"</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! We want Luo Zheng to fight!"</p>

  <p>For a moment, the entire Evolutionary Universe was filled with righteous indignation as people yelled and shouted out over one another.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle's voice was heard by everyone in the universe, including Luo Zheng, of course.</p>

  <p>After making amends with the Demon Night's internal strife, Luo Zheng had come into the Lower World in order to retrieve the Great Weighty Sword.</p>

  <p>This sword could withstand Zheng's power, making it a very suitable weapon for him. However, once it flew out of his hand, nothing in nature had the capacity to bear its weight, so it seeped all the way down into the Lower World and the deepest parts of the earth. It would only stop when it came into direct contact with the boundary of the Evolutionary Universe, known as the Sighing Wall.</p>

  <p>Once the righteous sword was in his possession, Luo Zheng activated the Teleportation Token and came to the Sunflower Water World. Xun, Supreme Lord Leia and a few of the other Demon Night members had already set off for the Dead Water World to meet up with the human Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>After entering the Sunflower Water World, Luo Zheng quickly and effortlessly chose a direction to go in. With a flash of the Space Law beneath his feet, he successfully crossed hundreds of miles in seconds.</p>

  <p>If one were to observe Luo Zheng from a high vantage point, they would see him blinking like a star, repeatedly using the Grand Teleportation in order to maintain his extremely high speed as he moved toward the center of the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>'Nathan has already died, but I don't know if his corpse has been destroyed or not. Would Supreme Lord Lester's Heavenly Destiny of Revival be able to revive him?' Luo Zheng wondered. As Luo Zheng hurried on his way, he weighed the matter in his mind.</p>

  <p>Previously, Karl had been torn to shreds and nearly killed by the sorcerer race's Angel of Death. Later, however, he was saved by Supreme Lord Lester. If Luo Zheng could at least get a hold of Nathan's corpse, then he knew he had chances of saving him, even if they were slim. What he didn't know though, was what condition Nathan was in. If he had already been burned to ashes, he wouldn't know if it would be possible for Supreme Lord Lester to save him with Heavenly Destiny of Revival.</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng continued rushing along his way, he was surprised by a bolt of lightning that exploded directly before him.</p>

  <p>Not too far off, he noticed two martial artists fighting. His eyes narrowed suddenly.</p>

  <p>'One of them is a Sacred warrior, ' Luo Zheng thought, his brow creasing slightly as his body floated into the air and sped toward the two martial artists.</p>

  <p>The Sunflower Water World had already become a huge battle ring. The Sacred and human warriors would constantly challenge each other within the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng watched these two people fight, he quickly noted that the Sacred warrior had the upper hand. As for the human grand world lord, he was completely suppressed by his opponent.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>The Sacred warrior shot out a brown bolt of lightning at the human martial artist. The bolt hit the human with great unexpected force and he was instantly nailed to the ground!</p>

  <p>"Ha ha ha! Inferior races are so useless! Go to hell!" cried the Sacred warrior. Just as he was about to take his final action and end the human grand world lord's life, he summoned a golden bolt of lightning that descended from the sky high above. The human grand world lord was currently unable to move. All that was left was to close his eyes and await his death.</p>

  <p>However, the lightning bolt was miraculously stopped in midair.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a figure appeared in the air. The odd figure stretched out its hand and cut the golden lightning in half with a single motion!</p>

  <p>The thick golden lightning bolt turned into thin lightning snakes, spreading out in all directions along Zheng's arms. Luo Zheng, on the other hand, smiled faintly at his opponent and said, "Since victory and defeat have already been decided, there's no need to slaughter anyone, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Who are you? How dare you interfere with my challenge? Doing so is completely against the rules." The Sacred warrior's face became cold.</p>

  <p>There weren't any large scale battles occurring in the Sunflower Water World at the moment. The human and Sacred warriors simply hated each other. Generally speaking, the winner of the battle would kill their opponent directly on the spot.</p>

  <p>It was a two-way street. No one else could interfere, and everyone knew this very well. It was an unwritten rule. Luo Zheng interfering in the fight right after his arrival truly was against the rules.</p>
