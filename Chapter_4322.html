<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4322 The Cutoff Of Energy </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The downgrader was born anew within the black light.</p>

  <p>The symbolic six pairs of compound eyes were set ablaze by a striking purple light that flickered from time to time, which represented his confusion.</p>

  <p>When he regained his senses, he realized that the world had become nothing like he imagined it would be.</p>

  <p>From the highest-grade world all the way to this low-grade world, the only worthy adversary he had that matched his standard of strength was Clarence. Then where did these two come from?</p>

  <p>"I don't care how powerful you are. It doesn't change the fact that you're destined to get destroyed to the point of oblivion!" The downgrader scorned resentfully as his body remained camouflaged under the black light.</p>

  <p>As the battle between the Evil God and Zheng raged on, the Wall World continued to shake and expand rapidly.</p>

  <p>Within the short span of an hour, the Wall World underwent an extreme expansion from the range of ten provinces to the size equivalent to that of the Source World. As time continued to pass by, the rate of expansion grew exponentially.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The Evil God slowly grew weary with this form of hand to hand combat that ceased to reach a conclusive end.</p>

  <p>He suddenly retreated to a fair distance and soared into the sky as he leaped to an incredible height of about one hundred million feet. As he continued to ascend, his mind was a cluster of countless thoughts rushing to be heard all at the same time.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, huge runes appeared at the top of the chaos, and one hundred thousand thunder dragons manifested in the form of energy started to rain down on Zheng from those runes.</p>

  <p>Clatter, clatter, clatter...</p>

  <p>Each thunder dragon harnessed a formidable strength that was ten thousand times stronger than that of the ending needle. The energy aura that was released by these thunder dragons alone held the capability to destroy everything in the chaos.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed as they fell on the approaching calamity. He prepared himself and gave his hand a slight wave in the direction of the fairy palace. Upon this gesture, a formidable shield was constructed around the fairy palace. Without this shield, the fairy palace would have been rendered vulnerable and eventually perished if it were enveloped by the dominating aura of energy.</p>

  <p>After all the preparations were done, Zheng extended his finger towards the top of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Annihilation Coke!"</p>

  <p>Since the Evil God had utilized the Creation Coke to inject vitality into these thunder dragons, Zheng had used the Annihilation Coke to lay waste to them.</p>

  <p>Through the Annihilation Coke, he constructed countless gray needles that directed themselves towards the thunder dragons.</p>

  <p>Each needle was the size of a thumb, and they were no different from the ones used for the purpose of sewing. However, the power contained within these needles was on par with that possessed by the thunder dragons. Once these needles pierced through the bodies of the thunder dragons, they would perish in an instant. With Zheng's technique, even the threatening thunder dragons were vulnerable as though they were insignificant obstructions in his path.</p>

  <p>"Weak attacks like these are no match for me. The only way we can counter the downgrade is for you to return to my body voluntarily.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, we'll all die here, together with all the worlds, and there will be no chance to reverse the situation," Zheng spoke in a hushed voice, trying to persuade the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng said those words to the Evil God alone, his voice echoed throughout the chaos and was audible to everyone in it.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the people present in the fairy palace and those on the black ship could hear him clearly as though he was speaking to them in person.</p>

  <p>"What you have is an opportunity, and what you'll give up will turn into regret!"</p>

  <p>With Evil God's hot-headed personality, how could he just give up and let go of this opportunity that lay there in front of him? He scoffed at Zheng's words as more thunder dragons descended from the runes and marked Zheng as their target.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood in his spot and constructed just as many needles to counter the incoming thunder dragons, eventually terminating them upon contact.</p>

  <p>The repetitive battle of creation and destruction continued on for a steady period.</p>

  <p>When Zheng kept on releasing the embroidery needles time and again, he felt a strange sensation take over his existence. His eyes flashed as though something was revealed to him. After communicating briefly with Clarence, he changed his course of direction and moved to a different part of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"Where do you think you're going? Don't tell me you're trying to escape!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God stood stunned at Zheng's sudden change of action.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't quite understand what was going on in Zheng's mind, he pursued him on instinct. As he chased after Zheng, his body moved at an untraceable speed, trying to keep up with him. He didn't stop till he reached the edge of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng stopped in his tracks, he turned to face the Evil God and leaned his back against the inner wall of the chaos. The expression he wore on his face was strangely calm as he kept his gaze fixated on his opponent.</p>

  <p>"It's pointless to try and run away from me. You can't escape this place," the Evil God sneered as a spiteful smirk stretched across his face.</p>

  <p>"I only lead you here to finish you off once and for all," Zheng replied, maintaining his calm composure.</p>

  <p>As these words escaped Zheng's mouth, the Evil God let out a mocking laugh before he glanced at Zheng with intrigued eyes. "Finish me off? How interesting! I'm dying to know what kind of method you'll use this time to manage that..."</p>

  <p>Previously, Zheng had used the method of illusion to devour the Evil God, but it ended in failure. Since the Evil God was familiar with it, it could not be used a second time.</p>

  <p>They were on the same level when it came to strength and methods, so no matter what they used, the other could easily neutralize it without a hitch.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you right now!"</p>

  <p>With a single wave of Zheng's hand, all the energy lying dormant in the void was extracted in one fell swoop.</p>

  <p>Masses of energy currents were now under the direct control of Zheng.</p>

  <p>These energy currents manifested themselves into vicious golden dragons that charged their way to surround the Evil God from all directions. These golden dragons were inexplicably large in size, with their number reaching up to a million!</p>

  <p>"So you plan to use the Creation Coke to kill me? How pathetic!"</p>

  <p>With a scornful expression painted across his face, the Evil God prepared himself to use the Annihilation Coke to counter the forthcoming attack.</p>

  <p>The confrontation between the two continued. However, during this round, their roles were reversed. Zheng was the one on the offense while the Evil God was pitted against him in defense.</p>

  <p>Just as the Evil God proceeded to use the Annihilation Coke, his demeanor underwent a drastic switch.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" the Evil God roared in confusion as he stared his hands down before glancing in Zheng's direction.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng smirked as he tilted his head and watched the Evil God's frantic state with amusement.</p>

  <p>Back then, when Zheng was preoccupied with crafting embroidery needles of the Annihilation Coke to clash against the Evil God's thunder dragons, he noticed some tiny holes in the energy.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the energy existed in two forms; invisible and visible.</p>

  <p>The visible energy consisted of energy bodies like the thunder dragons and the embroidery needles, as well as all the solidified materials of energy. On the contrary, the invisible energy existed in the void, which could be referred to as dark energy. The dark energy flowed in abundance quietly along with the void like water.</p>

  <p>When the Evil God used the Creation Coke without pause to create the thunder dragons, he had exhausted the dark energy in the area to a certain extent. As a result, an imbalance of energy distribution formed around this area. Therefore, the surrounding energy was pulled towards here to cover up for the insufficiency.</p>

  <p>But the dark energy constantly flowed at a certain speed.</p>

  <p>When the speed of the flow wasn't fast enough, a zone devoid of energy would form in the energy depression momentarily.</p>

  <p>This place was the real void, where even the dark energy ceased to exist!</p>

  <p>Although such a "hole" only remained in existence for a short while and would later be evened out by the dark energy in the surroundings, it provided Zheng with an opportunity to drive the Evil God into a corner.</p>

  <p>Zheng had consumed the maximum amount of energy present in the surroundings and created a million golden dragons. He didn't intend to kill the Evil God with these dragons, but he only wanted him to fall into an area without energy, which would then incapacitate him.</p>

  <p>Within the boundaries of this void zone, there was no dark energy for the Evil God to use, and the source of the dark energy was completely cut off, rendering him powerless.</p>

  <p>Even if the Evil God couldn't make use of the external energy, he still had high reserves of energy stored away in his body. As soon as he realized something was wrong, he immediately employed the spatial transference.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As a result, the figure of the Evil God began to blur out. Just as he was about to escape from this area, a stable space appeared where he stood.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Caught off guard from its sudden appearance, he crashed into the square space causing his body to stagger back a few steps. The spatial transference failed as he was interrupted midway.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! Once again!" the Evil God roared as he felt his growing anxiety consume his body and cloud his judgments. Without wasting another moment, he gritted his teeth and employed all of his energy to use the spatial transference a second time.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The limited strength he had left in him was insufficient to shake the square space.</p>

  <p>"Don't even try, as no amount of energy will break you out of there. You won't be able to move from here," Zheng said as he slowly descended towards the Evil God with his arms crossed above his chest.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of the flowing energy to deal with the Evil God was a technique even Clarence couldn't think of, but it proved to be effective in the end.</p>

  <p>The Evil God hung his head loosely from his neck as a shadow hovered over his face and hid his expressions. He remained silent for a while as he took his time to process the situation. Suddenly, he raised his head, and a mischievous smile stretched across his face as he laughed while staring Zheng dead in the eye. "Hahaha! You got me. I'll admit that it is pretty unexpected of you to pull a method like that. You almost managed to defeat me. You've always been the only person I admire for as long as I can remember. However, unfortunately..."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Zheng retorted immediately to ask what he meant.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately for you, I lost a finger..." the Evil God said with his signature smile overflowing with malice. He raised his hand that was missing his index finger and waved it near Zheng's face mockingly. Immediately after, his body collapsed on its own.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in another void of the chaos, an index finger rapidly regenerated and slowly formed human features. Within a few moments, it grew from a finger to a hand, an arm, a body, a head until it evolved into a complete human being with all limbs attached.</p>

  <p>Another perfect Evil God was reborn.</p>
