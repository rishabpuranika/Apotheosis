<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rolled his eyes at the group of ogres who were like small mountains.</p>

  <p>These guys went all out to force him to fight. He could only shake his head, thinking how shameless they were.</p>

  <p>They were just ogre war fighters. Why did they want to get themselves killed in this way?</p>

  <p>He indifferently looked around at the ogre war fighters who all looked fierce. Since they wanted to give him the Lucky Light, he found no reason to reject them. He was intending to accept their challenge.</p>

  <p>Just then, a blue-black ogre appeared behind the war fighters.</p>

  <p>Though the ogre was smaller in size than his clansmen, he possessed commanding presence. His eyes shined with a cold light and were abnormally sharp. When his gaze swept across, it even gave off the feeling of a sharp knife cutting through the faces.</p>

  <p>He was only a war general, but with his sharp and imposing demeanor, he could easily make others feel suppressed with such great pressure. Even Luo Luo Zheng didn't escape from sensing that kind of feeling as he let out a slight trace of surprise.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way," the war general said coldly.</p>

  <p>As the ogres who tightly blocked the road saw the war general behind them, fear and reverence appeared on their faces.</p>

  <p>"It's Elder Boris! Get out of the way!"</p>

  <p>"Don't push me! Greetings, Elder Boris."</p>

  <p>The ogres quickly dispersed, opening up a path for Boris. In no time, Luo Luo Zheng found himself facing the thin war general. He was glad that he already knew his name Boris from the ogres.</p>

  <p>Boris walked ahead, fixing his cold gaze on Luo Luo Zheng. "You are a human, but you are not an ordinary war fighter."</p>

  <p>"What does that have to do with you?" Luo Luo Zheng stared at Boris and asked, not afraid at all.</p>

  <p>"Not only do the ogres want your life, the Giants, the Orcs, and?" Boris's gaze fell on Phoebe, who was standing behind Luo Luo Zheng, and he continued with a slight tinge of surprise, "And the Demon Night also wants your life. We have dozens of ways to kill you, but I think the best way is to kill you in the arena. I'm waiting for you on the tenth floor. I hope you don't run away or stay here all the time."</p>

  <p>Hearing what Boris spouted, Luo Luo Zheng chuckled to himself. When his smile faded, he calmly responded, "My only purpose of coming to the Tower of Sin is, of course, to enter the higher floors. As for at which floor you are waiting for me, it has nothing to do with me. And there is no need to pointedly tell me that because you are not that strong enough to impress me."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's words made the faces of all the ogres change drastically.</p>

  <p>It was true that Boris was only a war general, but his status among the ogres was even higher than that of many war lords.</p>

  <p>The ogres possessed two sacred places on the Sea God Continent, the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place. Boris happened to be the most powerful talent in the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>But it didn't mean that he was not up to par with another talent in the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>With this attribute, many of the ogres showed great respect for and thought highly of him. With Boris's talent, it wouldn't be long before he reached the top of the Tower of Sin and helped the ogres obtain a new seat.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of many ogres, that Boris personally came here and declared war on Luo Luo Zheng was simply making a mountain out of a molehill. Why did he have to break a butterfly on a wheel? Not to mention a young human war fighter, Boris didn't need to fight with human war generals personally. They would do it on his behalf.</p>

  <p>The ogres turned suspicious about this.</p>

  <p>So they definitely deduced that when Boris personally declared war on Luo Luo Zheng, this meant the latter was someone not to be trifled with. They tentatively assumed that Luo Zheng's strength must be exceptional! From the looks of it, this human war fighter was not someone they could deal with that easily!</p>

  <p>What they never expected was that Luo Luo Zheng was even more arrogant than they had imagined. It was as if he looked down on their Elder Boris.</p>

  <p>A large majority of the ogres had angry expressions on their faces. They couldn't hide their disdain towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Human boy, you?" Before the ogres started to curse Luo Luo Zheng, Boris raised his hand to silence them.</p>

  <p>Then he eyed Luo Luo Zheng and stated indifferently, "Impressive. Only a few humans have such spirit. I'm looking forward to fighting with you more and more."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he turned around and was about to leave. But before he left, he seemed to have thought of something and addressed his clansmen around, "Don't waste your lives to challenge Luo Luo Zheng. Just let him freely advance."</p>

  <p>As an ogre, Boris was very familiar with his fellows. Even if they knew that they couldn't defeat Luo Luo Zheng, they couldn't help provoking Luo Luo Zheng at the risk of their lives. And this was the last thing he would want to happen.</p>

  <p>Judging from the information that Boris had learned, it was impossible for a war fighter to defeat Luo Luo Zheng. If a war fighter rashly stepped onto the arena to fight Luo Luo Zheng, he would be killed without doubt.</p>

  <p>"But Elder Boris..." An ogre had an unconvinced expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"Hmm?" Boris's forehead creased.</p>

  <p>That ogre war fighter's body shook, and he replied with a trembling voice,</p>

  <p>"I-I'm sorry ?"</p>

  <p>Boris shook his head, turned around and left.</p>

  <p>The ogres were still glaring at Luo Luo Zheng with anger as they stood their ground.</p>

  <p>However, they didn't dare to block Luo Zheng's way anymore because of the order from Boris.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng's face was as nonchalant as before. After Boris left, he too walked out with great strides, seemingly not caring about the death stares of the ogres.</p>

  <p>Phoebe followed him closely behind, because she was afraid that Luo Luo Zheng would run away.</p>

  <p>"What does free advancement mean?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Phoebe was already prepared to answer this question. With a faint smile, two perfect dimples appeared on her face. "Advancing to the next floor of the Tower of Sin requires points, but some creatures are too strong after entering the Tower of Sin, which will lead to a default victory."</p>

  <p>"Default victory?"</p>

  <p>"Right. Since their strength is too strong, no one dares to challenge them.</p>

  <p>Thus they won't be able to obtain points. You must note that 100 points are required to exchange for the qualifications to enter the next floor," Phoebe continued. "That's why there are rules for free advancement. If a creature gets three default victories in three days, then someone will record it, and he can get the qualifications to enter the next floor without needing points."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded and exclaimed, "So that's how it works."</p>

  <p>Many races worked together to make the rules, so the rules must be reasonable. If a strong warrior of a certain race entered the Tower of Sin to train, but no other races dared to fight him because he was too powerful, then the former might not be able to advance to the next floor all his life.</p>

  <p>To advance freely was naturally enough to make up for this deficiency.</p>

  <p>Phoebe and Luo Luo Zheng continued their pace, but as they walked past the arena, Luo Luo Zheng viewed that there were still intense battles going on.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin did not have any distinction between day and night. To many creatures, life was quite monotonous. It only revolved with life, death, battles, and training.</p>

  <p>Because of the intense and extreme pressure, many special services were created around the Tower of Sin. All sorts of strange and exotic things in the Sea God Continent could be found here. Not only could warriors buy things with their points, but supreme life vitality crystals could also be used here.</p>

  <p>After passing the arena, Luo Luo Zheng walked out of the Tower of Sin. He raised his head and looked at the sky filled with stars. It was the full moon.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked back at Phoebe, who followed him closely behind. Since she was smartly sensitive, with just a glance, she instantly understood what Luo Luo Zheng meant. She revealed an elegant smile and kept her distance. Right now, he needed to practice.</p>

  <p>Phoebe had given him a lot of help, but she couldn't always follow him for the sake of his sword spirit, Lily. She was not inclined to know everything about Luo Luo Zheng, but the information about her queen was too important, so she kept on following him.</p>

  <p>After keeping a certain distance from Phoebe, Luo Luo Zheng found a secluded spot.</p>

  <p>He sat down cross-legged. He then raised his head to look at the sky. The sky was filled with stars, which were embedded in the night sky, connecting with each other, forming a silver pillar.</p>

  <p>"Can we start now?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Not bad. This is a very suitable place to cultivate the Stellar Body," the red dragon responded.</p>

  <p>As soon as the red dragon's voice fell, countless profound characters and information appeared in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>"Although the second half of the Stellar Body is lost, the first half has recorded its general principles. As it says, the first step is to activate the star power. As the saying goes, everything is difficult at the beginning.</p>

  <p>Activating the first star power is the most difficult. You don't have to succeed the first time, but you can try it first," the red dragon said faintly.</p>

  <p>It was not so easy to cultivate Transcendent Divine Might.</p>

  <p>At the time, when the red dragon grasped the Stellar Body, his cultivation had already reached a point that was difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to understand.</p>

  <p>However, it had taken him a full five years to comprehend the Stellar Body.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not say anything as he sat on the ground, quietly digesting the information in his mind.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, the stars in the sky had already quietly shifted their positions to a certain distance. Only then did Luo Luo Zheng abruptly open his eyes. A sharp light shone out from his eyes as he looked towards the sky.</p>
