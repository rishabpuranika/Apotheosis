<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2815 The Oneness Sky Palace </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A milky white bright moon hung over the top of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Looking down from the sky road above, one could see tens of thousands of mountains penetrating into the clouds.</p>

  <p>Every mountain was likened to a towering sharp sword. On the tip of each mountain were significant words engraved on it.</p>

  <p>Together, these words would be read as 'Truth of Eternal Sword Intent'.</p>

  <p>Every year in the early spring, the inner disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace would have the opportunity to observe from the sky road above. It was the day they would study and comprehend the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent.</p>

  <p>While they observed, the masters would give enlightenment and teach them about its main points.</p>

  <p>The disciples depended on their abilities to grasp the teachings. Those with talent and great luck would be able to come out on top in this period of time.</p>

  <p>Once an inner disciple had fully grasped the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, and at the same time had successfully stepped into the Sea of Truth, they would certainly get the attention of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Currently at this moment, over 400, 000 inner disciples were still trying their hardest to understand the words.</p>

  <p>They were focused on their own ways to study the words as they persisted to hold on. Some were chanting and some stood with their eyes open wide.</p>

  <p>"Plop!"</p>

  <p>"Plop!"</p>

  <p>Understanding the Truth of Godly Way by force would put a lot of pressure on the soul.</p>

  <p>Although the inner disciples had become consummate True Gods and had the Soul of Light, they still couldn't bear the pressure of the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. As a result, their bodies gave way as they rolled their eyes and fainted on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Some Taoist priests in cyan robes flew and came over. They carried the fainted inner disciples out of the ring.</p>

  <p>At the front end of the sky road, there were sixteen inner disciples who were quietly seated.</p>

  <p>They had successfully built their Truth Boats and sailed on the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Unlike the over 400, 000 inner disciples, they had taken a big step forward.</p>

  <p>They were considered as an inspiration as other inner disciples constantly looked at them from time to time, their eyes full of admiration.</p>

  <p>"Alas. I have been here for 36 years. In the very first year when Stanley and Terence set foot on the sky road, they went to the Sea of Truth. But for us, it appears as distant as ever." A middle-aged man wearing a scarf sighed as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"There are some people that we can't compare with. Stanley is talented, and Terence is out of the ordinary. We have to work harder," another man said helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how far they can reach when they go to the sea for the first time.</p>

  <p>It will take at least three to five days..." Before the middle-aged man could finish his words, he heard a sudden plop. Terence, who was seated on the front, fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Questions had arose. Many people were originally paying attention to Terence, and upon seeing this scene, they immediately screamed.</p>

  <p>"What happened? Terence has failed?"</p>

  <p>"He has just entered the Sea of Truth. It's impossible."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>On the high platform behind the sky road, an old man with white beard also saw what happened. He frowned slightly, flew up, and landed beside Terence.</p>

  <p>He slightly shook the horsetail whisk in his hand, and then he put his hand on Terence's chest. He closed his eyes and thought for a while. With a slight pull of his old finger, Terence screamed and woke up.</p>

  <p>"You guys just entered the Sea of Truth. Why did you use the Illusion Breaking Rune? What happened?" the old man asked with concern.</p>

  <p>He was the one who gave the Illusion Breaking Runes to the disciples before they went to the sea. It was a rule to follow in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>It was already known that the journey to the Sea of Truth was not calm and peaceful. Sometimes they would encounter big storms or even maelstroms.</p>

  <p>If the disciples couldn't withdraw from the Sea of Truth in time before their Truth Boats were destroyed, their souls would be scattered into pieces as soon as they fell into the water.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Breaking Rune would be needed at this time. If they crushed it, their souls would be pulled back to reality from the sea. At this critical moment, the Illusion Breaking Rune was a life-saving straw.</p>

  <p>As soon as Terence woke up and saw the old man, he cried out in pain,</p>

  <p>"Master, we met a monster!"</p>

  <p>The old man was slightly stunned. He asked, "What monster? Did you make a mistake?"</p>

  <p>For a moment, he doubted. It was normal for some disciples who had just entered the Sea of Truth to have illusions because their souls couldn't withstand the pressure from the sea.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely no!" Terence insisted in an angry tone.</p>

  <p>"I saw him with my own eyes. He didn't have a Truth Boat. He just wandered in the Sea of Truth. I wanted to check his strength, but I didn't expect him to smash my Truth Boat. Therefore, I had no choice but to use the Illusion Breaking Rune," he continued and narrated what happened.</p>

  <p>"He didn't have a Truth Boat?" The old man's eyes narrowed, and asked,</p>

  <p>"He just wandered in the Sea of Truth with his soul?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Terence answered with certainty.</p>

  <p>The old man paused for a moment before he spoke with a cold smile,</p>

  <p>"Terence, although you have a powerful background, it means nothing in the Oneness Sky Palace. I guide you in cultivation because you have outstanding talent. Why do you lie to me?"</p>

  <p>Hearing what the old man said, Terence got anxious. "Master, I'm not lying to you! I'm not the only one who saw that man. Sophia and Stanley also saw him. If you don't believe me, you can ask them after they leave the Sea of Truth. If I tell a lie, I'm willing to receive any punishment from the Oneness Sky Palace!"</p>

  <p>The old man was taken aback at how Terence acted in certainty. He was a little bit confused after hearing what he said.</p>

  <p>It was indeed not an easy task to cross the Sea of Truth. He knew that it was a long and difficult process.</p>

  <p>Why was the Sea of Truth so dangerous? It was because all the souls could be engulfed by it. Even the old man's soul was no exception. It was common sense, so he didn't trust Terence no matter what he said.</p>

  <p>"Okay. Let's wait for their return."</p>

  <p>Back in the Sea of Truth, Stanley and the others were still watching the scene, cursing Terence in their hearts.</p>

  <p>If Zheng vented his anger on them, he would destroy their Truth Boats.</p>

  <p>It might be troublesome but since they had already mastered the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, it was not difficult for them to condense other Truth Boats.</p>

  <p>None of them dared and wanted to provoke Zheng, so they all kept their silence.</p>

  <p>"I didn't make things difficult for you, but he gave me problems. I have every reason to smash his boat, right?" Zheng flatly said as he turned his attention to the group. He was still soaked in the sea.</p>

  <p>The group heard him but didn't respond. Stanley heaved a sigh of relief, and then hurriedly bowed to Zheng. "Yes, sir. Terence shouldn't have been so reckless. His boat was smashed. He deserved it!"</p>

  <p>"Right. Terence is usually a rude man. He deserved the punishment from you!" Sophia chimed in.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng could not see the faces of these people, he could roughly sense that they should also be consummate True Gods. Feeling their sincerity in treating him respectfully, he couldn't help a suppressed giggle.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 told him a reminder to not expose himself. In order to do so, he didn't want to talk to them too much, so he waved his hand and said, "Okay, you can go now."</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, Stanley and the others felt relieved as they were not to be implicated any more.</p>

  <p>Every one of them hurriedly sat cross-legged and meditated. They urged their Truth Boats to move on the Sea of Truth. Their journey continued.</p>
