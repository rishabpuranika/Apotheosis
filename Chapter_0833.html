  <p>
</p>

  <p>A hint of a smile worked its way onto Zheng's face upon hearing the words spoken by Teresa. The woman appeared to be indignant as she stubbornly refused to accept her previous defeat.</p>

  <p>Zheng would gladly give her a chance to challenge him if he encountered her on the third or fourth floor of the tower.</p>

  <p>As Zheng stood on the stage and waited for a long time, it was to his relief that no one had come up to challenge him. In this particular circumstance, it meant that Zheng could spend the whole day leisurely and get the default victory today due to the fact that he did not have to battle or challenge anyone.</p>

  <p>One full day later, Zheng found himself stepping once more onto the arena. It did not take too long this time before he successfully got the qualification to advance to the third floor, seeing as he had not fought with any brave challengers on the arena for the third time in a row. Anticipating the next floor, Zheng was prepared to participate in the battles happening on the third floor.</p>

  <p>A discernible fact about the Tower of Sin was that there were many war fighters dispersed on the first floor up to the fifth floor. However, it was apparent that the number of war generals evidently increased if one happened to ascend floor by floor. Moreover, the fifth floor and the subsequent higher floors were only swarmed with war generals, not a single war fighter in sight.</p>

  <p>Due to the news spreading about Zheng's arrival, there was palpable tension hanging in the air, as well as a slight commotion from the warriors situated on the first floor up to the fifth floor. The warriors who were currently challenging on the third floor were not fools, and they all instantly moved out of the way when they laid their eyes upon Zheng as every single one of them knew of his reputation. Only a very few of the braver creatures on the floor attempted to challenge Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Zheng continuously climbed up to the higher floors, he drew more and more attention to himself. The living creatures, most especially the human warriors were clearly intrigued by his presence. Many human war generals on the higher floors personally came down from their floors to witness Zheng's battles, albeit only a few war fighters dared to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the few battles he had gone through were exceedingly short, as those who ventured to stand on the arena were instantly defeated by Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was a shame, as no one thus could really see an exciting fighting scene, or truly witness how powerful the young man really was.</p>

  <p>Located on the west side of the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin was a huge room. From what the living creatures had heard, this particular area had always been occupied by the ogre, and the members of other races were not allowed to approach the place.</p>

  <p>In the Tower of Sin, all of its areas were considered as public spaces that anyone qualified could occupy. However, the truth was that the area controlled by the ogre was the largest, and ultimately off-limits.</p>

  <p>At one point, the ogre originally desired to monopolize the entirety of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, the ogres had nearly succeeded in achieving their mission and even managed to throw others out of the Tower of Sin. The desperate attempt to dominate the place also led them to prevent other creatures from entering it, which was an extremely controversial matter at the time.</p>

  <p>In those days, the ogre had occupied over sixty seats in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>As the race with the most powerful force in the Tower of Sin, the ogre back then had the ultimate authority of suddenly issuing an order which contained the elimination of all the living beings from other races out of the Tower of Sin. The worst part of the mandate was that every single creature who refused to leave was killed inside the tower mercilessly.</p>

  <p>The ogres were triumphant in carrying out their plan during that period of time. Other than the ogres, no living creatures from other races remained in the tower for the fear of being executed. Thus, all of them had been expelled against their will.</p>

  <p>During that withering month, only the ogres were able to freely enter and use the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>However, this move of the ogre was a great nuisance, as their arrogance in owning the place was based solely on their strength, much to everyone else's disdain.</p>

  <p>In the Sea God Continent, no one dared to challenge the might of the ogres as they were the most flourishing race and the only ones who had possessed two sacred places. It was hopeless for the other races even if they revolted against the vastly powerful ogres, due to the ill-fated notion that the ogres could still remain unbeatable against their attempt. But if they all cooperated together to attack the ogres, they could be very powerful.</p>

  <p>Despite the discouraging odds, it had been immensely difficult for the ogres to resist the Demon Night sacred place's members. Only if the members of the Dread Ogre Sacred Place and the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place had joined forces, they would be able to grab a fighting chance against the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Back then, all the races unwaveringly united and had almost succeeded in attacking and suppressing the two sacred places of the ogre.</p>

  <p>All of the sacred places established on the Sea God Continent heavily relied on the Tower of Sin. This was because if they had lost the opportunity to utilize the Tower of Sin as a place for the strong warriors to cultivate, it would have a devastating impact to the continuation of the sacred places of their respective races.</p>

  <p>If they failed to train their younger generation, it would be as dangerous as losing their foundation. Moreover, the implications of such a loss bore consequences for all because if the ogres gradually became stronger in the future while the other races remained stagnant, they would eventually be wiped out from the continent. Due to the threatening possibility of that future, those races stood up for themselves and tried their best to fight against the imposing race instead of helplessly waiting for the ogres to drive them out of the continent.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the allied forces of various races make their way determinedly and passionately to the ogre's sacred places, the ogres finally understood that they had crossed the line and done some reckless things they wished that they should not have done in the first place.</p>

  <p>Without any effective methods to resist the siege and the penetrating attacks of the other living creatures, the ogres begrudgingly opened the door of the Tower of Sin once again to the public. Moreover, they reluctantly gave up on some seats.</p>

  <p>After the conclusion of the revolution against the ogre race, it appeared to be true that the distribution of power within the Tower of Sin was a microcosm of the entire Sea God Continent. However, the state of the human beings was drastically low as they were easily intimidated by the other more formidable races. As such, they did not have a high position in the Tower of Sin. On the other hand, the Demon Night was a very powerful and unbeatable race; no one dared to look down upon their skills in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Although the ogre gave up on monopolizing the Tower of Sin, it was still a staggering fact that a significantly large portion of the tower was controlled by this race.</p>

  <p>The decorations in this spacious room looked incredibly sparse and rough, a far cry from being considered as delicate or elegant. Scattered around the room were several ogres, with some of them sitting on the ground and some lying down haphazardly. The ogres seemed to be in the middle of a crucial discussion.</p>
