<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3905 The Problem Of The Ancestry-level Bloodline</b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Dark Haze Peak was a place of cultivation in the Li Shan mountain. The pool looked small, but was in fact ten thousand feet deep.</p>

  <p>A drop of the ancestry-level blood could instantly cause the water in the pool to evaporate. The heat emanating off of it was not to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The blood at the bottom of the pool began to lengthen before Luo Zheng's eyes. It was ten feet long before it stopped. It then drilled into the Dark Haze Peak.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Cracks sounded from within the peak as the blood began to cut the peak.</p>

  <p>It had gone rogue just because Luo Zheng hadn't accepted it. And at the rate it was going, it looked like it was threatening Luo Zheng by saying that it would destroy everything if he didn't accept it.</p>

  <p>"Alas..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was rendered speechless. He was no longer treating it as a drop of blood, but as a living being.</p>

  <p>A while later, a neat cut appeared on one side of the Dark Haze Peak.</p>

  <p>If given enough time, this drop of blood could hack the Dark Haze Peak to dust.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no choice but to stretch out his right hand, in order to summon it back.</p>

  <p>He then felt a strange fluctuation of the ancestry-level bloodline in his body, as if it was releasing a signal to make that drop of blood return to him.</p>

  <p>That drop of blood seemed to have ears. At the summons from the bloodline in Luo Zheng's body, it quickly rushed back and drilled into his finger.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had originally planned to accept this drop of blood, but his face darkened as he felt the difference of the ancestry-level bloodline in his body. He flicked his finger once again, sending the drop of blood flying outwards.</p>

  <p>How could he allow his blood to master his own body?</p>

  <p>He had already sensed back in the square that the process of his fusion with the bloodline was slightly different from that of others.</p>

  <p>According to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, once the bloodline was successfully absorbed, it would become a part of him.</p>

  <p>He might not be proficient in using the token bestowed by the bloodline in the beginning. But he would become more and more skillful as time passed and with constant use.</p>

  <p>The bloodline was part of the body. It wouldn't cause trouble without reason.</p>

  <p>But the bloodline in Luo Zheng's body was acting strangely.</p>

  <p>He didn't know how to use the ancestry-level bloodline. When he had emerged from the Eternal Scroll Painting, the ancestry-level bloodline had displayed several theurgies according to the situations on its own.</p>

  <p>In a nutshell, the ancestry-level bloodline was like a puppeteer while Luo Zheng was just a puppet.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to obtain the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>But how could he become its puppet?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng would not allow this to happen!</p>

  <p>The drop of blood suddenly changed form.</p>

  <p>It was only the size of a bean, but in this moment, it turned into a monster's head. It even had a mouth and a vocal organ and was wailing in protest.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt his body spiral out of control.</p>

  <p>It felt like someone else was holding him in his body. He pounced towards the drop of blood, his body stiff.</p>

  <p>No matter how he tried to summon his strength and activate the Other Shore Tokens, he was unable to change anything.</p>

  <p>He trembled and stretched out a hand to the drop of blood. The monster-like blood finally returned to normal. It got in through his fingertip. It was only then that the force that controlled his body disappeared and his body finally returned to normal.</p>

  <p>Once the violent conflict between the two forces disappeared, Luo Zheng felt pain in his body. He lost his strength and fell to the ground. He asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven while panting, "This blood..."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was also rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>He had felt that something was wrong when the ancestry-level bloodline began to make all sorts of responses.</p>

  <p>Since the ancestry-level bloodline was extraordinary and beyond his realm of knowledge, he thought that perhaps this was its own ability and didn't think further about it.</p>

  <p>But now, it seemed that the ancestry-level bloodline had its own consciousness and was about to disobey every one of Luo Zheng's orders.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you haven't really refined the ancestry-level bloodline yet," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>He was worried, now that he knew the background of the ancestry-level bloodline in the Eternal Divine Courtyard.</p>

  <p>An origin-level bloodline alone was extremely powerful. What would the ancestry-level bloodline that no one had ever completely obtained be like?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also realized the seriousness of the problem. "What should we do?"</p>

  <p>It was true that the bloodline was powerful, but it wouldn't be worth it if he became a puppet of this bloodline.</p>

  <p>"You must find a way to refine it and erase its consciousness. Let me help you," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't know how intelligent the ancestry-level bloodline was, so he didn't say anything. He merely sat cross-legged and conjured an incarnation in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, there were still a lot of forces that Luo Zheng could rely on in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Under the arrangements that the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the others had made, a red net array was formed in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had to refine the ancestry-level bloodline completely to erase its consciousness.</p>

  <p>A full six days passed in his inner world.</p>

  <p>When, in his excitement, he moved the net array out of his elixir field and activated it, the bloodline in his body began to fluctuate.</p>

  <p>The net array collapsed and disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>"?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Snake Goddess, and the other human heroes were dumbstruck.</p>

  <p>"It has been eroded by a completely opposite energy," the Snake Goddess said awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Things aren't as simple as we think," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, shaking his head. The ancestry-level bloodline could dissolve any kind of energy, and Luo Zheng probably wouldn't be able to refine it by himself. "It looks like we'll have to turn to external forces."</p>

  <p>"External forces?" Luo Zheng repeated thoughtfully. "You mean Gerald's power?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, nodding.</p>

  <p>Gerald had mastered the life truth, while Judson had mastered the creation truth.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't hesitate. Now that he was facing a formidable enemy, a war would break out at any time. And before that happened, he had to solve this hidden trouble in his body. Gerald was trustworthy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng went to visit Gerald and told him about the bloodline. Gerald was surprised at the weirdness of the story but thought it was understandable.</p>

  <p>The bloodline that Luo Zheng had obtained was too powerful.</p>

  <p>As the Son of Truth who was in charge of the life truth, Gerald was familiar with bloodlines. He thought for a while before turning towards Luo Zheng and taking action.</p>

  <p>He punctured Luo Zheng's back. When the truth energy was injected into his body, it disappeared without a trace, just like the net array.</p>

  <p>Although Gerald knew the characteristics of Luo Zheng's bloodline, he was still a little unconvinced. He didn't believe that he couldn't suppress the bloodline.</p>

  <p>The truth energy was again infused and dispersed into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Gerald became tired but the ancestry-level bloodline in Luo Zheng's body remained the same.</p>

  <p>The bloodline remained unaffected, seemingly invincible.</p>
