<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The entire divine land was in a panic.</p>

  <p>Darkness was not a big obstacle to a True God. When one's eyes were unable to see anything, they could use their spiritual sense to perceive instead.</p>

  <p>However, this kind of darkness had never happened before. No one knew what this kind of darkness meant. Speculations ran rampant, and ignorance fueled the panic people felt.</p>

  <p>"Is it doomsday?"</p>

  <p>"Is the divine land about to be destroyed?"</p>

  <p>"How long will this darkness last? Will it last forever?"</p>

  <p>Most of the divine citizens from the remote mountain villages and the True Gods of the central divine cities gathered under the cover of darkness. They wondered, discussed, and guessed about the nature of the darkness.</p>

  <p>Zheng also couldn't see anything with his eyes. Even if he activated his magic vision, it still had no effect.</p>

  <p>This was because Pascal blocked all the sources of light. If Zheng wanted to see in the darkness with his magic vision, he still needed the help of faint beams of light.</p>

  <p>At that moment he was trapped in darkness. With a deep inhale, he released his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Tianming, Sword Chen, many Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods also released their spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, waves of soul force spread throughout the plain.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Pascal held a black ball in his hand. It was releasing a very powerful aura.</p>

  <p>This aura was very similar to the Destructive Godly Way's aura, albeit much, much stronger.</p>

  <p>He raised the black ball high and said darkly, "It's over..."</p>

  <p>Hardly had his voice faded away when Zheng, Tianming and Sword Chen noticed that the same destructive aura was coming from above their heads.</p>

  <p>With a sweep of their spiritual sense, they realized that there was a black ball above each of their heads.</p>

  <p>"Don't let them touch you!"</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Tianming and Sword Chen promptly flew backward and away from the black balls.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng jumped lightly from side to side. He turned into a sharp arrow and swiftly retreated.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh.</p>

  <p>Black spears shot down from each ball. As each spear touched the ground, they suddenly released terrifying energy and annihilated every area they touched.</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to run away, as the black spears fell like a violent storm around him. The areas he passed were destroyed upon contact with the spears.</p>

  <p>Tianming and Sword Chen also dodged as Zheng did. They couldn't stop for even a second, as their lives were on the line. The black balls above their heads followed their every move. They continuously produced black arrows that struck almost at their heels, as they hurried away.</p>

  <p>"The areas he can affect are limited. We should separate!" Zheng shouted in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Tianming and Sword Chen immediately moved faster in response. Sword Chen dashed toward the side of the valley.</p>

  <p>"Fleeing? Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Pascal stood in the air with a mocking expression on his face. With no warnings, he spread the scope of his attack all over the plain. He watched in glee as the people panicked.</p>

  <p>The other Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods had long realized that they could not participate in a battle of this level. For fear of being accidentally injured, they all retreated to the edge of the valley.</p>

  <p>However, Pascal took one long look at them as if in deep thought.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a wicked smile spread on his face.</p>

  <p>Black balls appeared one by one over these warriors' heads!</p>

  <p>"What's this?" Some of them noticed the black balls above their heads.</p>

  <p>They cried out in alarm when they realized that they were being targeted too.</p>

  <p>"Run!" "This guy is insane!"</p>

  <p>"Does this guy want to kill everyone?"</p>

  <p>The Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods panicked, and they ran as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>A consummate True God reacted just a bit slowly, and a black spear pierced him through the shoulder. A pained shout escaped him, as the spear nailed him to the ground. Suddenly, the black spear melted and oozed out of him.</p>

  <p>It left his body destroyed and lifeless.</p>

  <p>Everyone realized the very real danger they were in and started to run away faster.</p>

  <p>Of course, Alfredo and Leland were running as well.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh.</p>

  <p>Alfredo's face was full of grief and indignation as he ran. He drew an arc along the ground at an extremely fast speed and left the black spears behind him. When he approached Pascal, he roared at him, "Pas...Holy Emperor!</p>

  <p>Do you also want to kill me?"</p>

  <p>An indifferent expression appeared on Pascal's face. He thought for a short moment, and then the black light ball above Alfredo's head disappeared.</p>

  <p>Samuel didn't care about the lives of these people, but he decided not to kill Alfredo since he had been loyal to him all this time.</p>

  <p>Alfredo heaved a sigh of relief when the black ball above him disappeared.</p>

  <p>From afar, screams resounded constantly. More and more people were stabbed by long spears and killed.</p>

  <p>"Holy Emperor, are you going to kill everyone?" Alfredo cupped his hands in front of Pascal.</p>

  <p>Before this, Samuel had doubts about letting others know his control over Pascal, but now he didn't care about it anymore. Under Samuel's control, Pascal said indifferently, "After all of these warriors are killed, no one will compete against you for the title of Holy Being. Wouldn't you like that?"</p>

  <p>When Alfredo heard that, his heart skipped a beat. He was displeased earlier because he was almost killed. But now, he didn't feel furious anymore. He put on a flattering smile on his face and said, "Thank you, Holy Emperor. If the Han Clan has one more Holy Being, our clan would be more powerful."</p>

  <p>Pascal gave a faint smile and nodded his head.</p>

  <p>Samuel had seen the strength of the Other Shore Realm warriors, and honestly, he did not take the Holy Beings seriously.</p>

  <p>Leyton had said that the Holy Beings were just True Gods who owned the Rebirth Land, which was their universe and gave the Holy Beings more power. This made the Holy Beings much more powerful than the consummate True Gods. However, in essence, they still relied on the power of the Godly Way.</p>

  <p>In this sense, only the Other Shore Realm warriors were the real masters.</p>

  <p>"These warriors run here and there like rats, so how can you kill them?"</p>

  <p>Alfredo asked.</p>

  <p>"Run? Didn't you notice?" Pascal raised an eyebrow at Alfredo. He only smirked when Alfredo looked confused, but he didn't elaborate.</p>

  <p>When he realized he wouldn't get any answers, Alfredo spread his spiritual sense into the darkness again. He could feel the destructive aura everywhere in the plain.</p>

  <p>It appeared that most of the long spears from the black balls didn't hit their targets. But as they melted, they spread in all directions rapidly, like ink over clear water.</p>

  <p>The longer they spent running around, the more black energy spread throughout the whole plain.</p>

  <p>Sooner or later, it would cover everything. By then, these people would have no way to escape.</p>

  <p>Some warriors had stopped running by this time. They, too, had realized what was happening.</p>

  <p>Zheng circled the plain. When he came back, he found that the long spears behind him had blended into the ground, radiating an aura of destruction.</p>

  <p>This aura continued to spread. It wouldn't be long before the whole plain and valley were filled up with the aura!</p>

  <p>"Tianming, we can't go on like this," Zheng uttered worriedly.</p>

  <p>Tianming, who was standing in the distance, agreed and said, "If we fly, we can dodge the black energy. However, after this place is filled with that energy, Samuel would definitely take further action. All the people in the Mountain of Holy Beings would be slaughtered!"</p>

  <p>"We need to stop him before that happens," Zheng said as he ran madly.</p>

  <p>"Pascal has a soul weapon. If I can break that, I can rid Pascal completely of Samuel's control."</p>

  <p>When he heard this, Tianming raised his eyebrows in confusion.</p>
