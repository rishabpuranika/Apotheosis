<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pearce and Auden had set a high expectation for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Such an unrealistic expectation became the key to breaking the dilemma.</p>

  <p>However, things suddenly turned to a direction that the two of them found hard to accept. Did Zheng really rush into the raging flames and commit suicide?</p>

  <p>There was nothing Pearce could do or say, except for the shocked twitch of his face.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Auden was very much taken aback as well.</p>

  <p>Both of them didn't know much about Zheng. They had met Zheng for the first time in the Supreme Dragon Hall, and their impressions of him weren't so great. They thought that Zheng was extremely arrogant and even dared to refuse the marriage that Eastern Emperor Taiyi had arranged for him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Athemar and Goran knew Zheng much better.</p>

  <p>For instance, Athemar knew that Zheng wasn't afraid of the unearthly fire, but even Athemar himself didn't dare to touch the flames that the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows spat out. If that was the case, would Zheng truly be safe?</p>

  <p>But of course, Zheng was not a brainless person. Perhaps he was quite confident in his abilities, which was why he charged straight like that.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>Zheng and his Corpse Spirit Sun Crow were bathed together in the blue flames, and as time passed, the distance between them and the other crows became closer.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a consciousness floated in Zheng's mind. "Emperor Charm!</p>

  <p>Is it okay?"</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm's shadow nodded in response and then his eyes flashed a ray of green light.</p>

  <p>To take control of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows was a piece of cake for him.</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the connections with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows kept appearing in Zheng's mind!</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Elizabeth was agitated.</p>

  <p>The remaining Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were originally under her control, but now they quickly disappeared from her mind one after another!</p>

  <p>"He is still alive!" she shouted angrily in despair.</p>

  <p>After a while, all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows were finally under Zheng's control except for the one she sat on.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>With just a thought, Zheng made the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows stop spurting blue flames. His pure golden body came into everyone's sight once again.</p>

  <p>Below them was Sinclair, who looked up dumbfoundedly at the scene in the sky. He couldn't believe what just happened!</p>

  <p>Of course, he didn't know about the true fight between the Sun Crow race and the Oneness Sky Palace. He simply thought that the Sun Crow race's strongest weapons were the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, and Zheng alone had subdued such a formidable force...</p>

  <p>He had fought against the entire Sun Crow race alone.</p>

  <p>That kind of thing was more of an illusion than a dream!</p>

  <p>"Nice to meet you again," Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Elizabeth felt resentful and miserable. Her shoulders trembled slightly. She only wanted to tear Zheng apart alive.</p>

  <p>"Hiss, hiss, hiss..."</p>

  <p>Just then, wisps of thin flames gently lit up along her body.</p>

  <p>She slightly shook her right hand, and then all the silky flames went up along her arms. The flames began to weave together like thin threads until they turned into a long, fiery spear.</p>

  <p>"You are indeed an opponent that deserves my admiration," Elizabeth said as she held onto the flaming spear. "I can give you a chance to challenge me, or even kill me. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Her voice had a trace of magic, which lured Zheng to agree to the duel.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's cultivation level was lower than hers, he now controlled over a hundred Corpse Spirit Sun Crows!</p>

  <p>In terms of combat strength, a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow was actually on par with Elizabeth. Thus, he had a great advantage this time.</p>

  <p>Now, Elizabeth had no choice.</p>

  <p>It was Emperor Charm who had ordered to break through the Sky Net with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>The Oneness Sky Palace's two strongest and most troublesome fighters, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Yasamin, were still under control on the Other Shore, but it seemed that even without them, the Oneness Sky Palace was still powerful after all.</p>

  <p>They would attract the siege of the seven mountains if they broke through the Sky Net first. The Sun Crow race would wait for the leaders and strong warriors of the seven mountains to be exhausted and defeated if they did get out of the Sky Net, before anything else.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had appeared so suddenly and took all the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows!</p>

  <p>Since everything had escalated to this point, Elizabeth could only deal with Zheng first.</p>

  <p>"Challenge you and kill you?" Zheng asked as he sat on the back of a Sun Crow. The other Sun Crows turned around and faced Elizabeth. If he ever thought about attacking her, they naturally would capture her.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You've improved your strength every time I see you. Now it's time for you to fight me. What do you think?" said Elizabeth in a hazy voice.</p>

  <p>"I'm interested," Zheng answered attentively.</p>

  <p>The corners of Elizabeth's lips curled and she straightened her chest. Only by defeating Zheng on her own could the plan go smoothly.</p>

  <p>The moment she thought that she now had her chance, Zheng exclaimed, "I changed my mind now!"</p>

  <p>"Swoosh..."</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow that he sat on flew towards the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>After that, the other Corpse Spirit Sun Crows suddenly opened their mouths and spat out blue flames towards Elizabeth. Then, they spread their wings and followed behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Pearce saw what happened, he was overjoyed.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Turn off the Sky Net's restriction and let those Corpse Spirit Sun Crows in!" he ordered. Generally speaking, the huge Sky Net only allowed the people of the Oneness Sky Palace to come in and out.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows couldn't enter it, even though they were under Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Oneness Sky Palace had intervened, and the Sky Net was quickly adjusted.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape? It's not that easy!" Elizabeth hissed.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>She immediately made her Corpse Spirit Sun Crow avoid the blue flames and chase after Zheng.</p>

  <p>The pair of fire wings on her back flapped, and then she dashed forward together with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. Her speed was more than twice as high as Zheng's!</p>

  <p>As long as she could successfully catch him, she could intercept these Corpse Spirit Sun Crows.</p>

  <p>That was the only thought that ran through her mind.</p>

  <p>As soon as she got closer to him, she jumped up from the back of the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow. The tip of the flaming spear in her hand spun at high speed and let out an ear-piercing sound.</p>

  <p>The spear contained a terrifying number of divine megatons of power. It was so intense that under its immense pressure, the space that touched the tip of the spear formed a dark dot.</p>

  <p>"This spear strike would definitely kill you!"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth had channeled all her grief and remorse into her spear strike, so much that she had completely forgotten about the order to capture Zheng alive.</p>

  <p>Yet, she saw that Zheng only looked back at her with scornful eyes.</p>

  <p>It could be that she was afraid of him mocking her, so when she met his gaze, she felt an inexplicable rush of panic.</p>

  <p>'Why does he look at me like that?</p>

  <p>Did I miss anything?!</p>

  <p>Whatever!'</p>

  <p>She discarded all her thoughts, and proceeded to throw the spear of flames in her hand.</p>

  <p>However, at this moment, the eyes of the last Corpse Spirit Sun Crow that Zheng did not take away lit up like emeralds.</p>

  <p>Its torso flipped in the air. Then it fiercely flapped its wings and hit Elizabeth's body.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The wings slammed her hard, and she fell from the sky.</p>
