<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 949 At The Foot Of The Tower </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Maurice let out a long sigh. He wasn't that old. According to the calendar of the Sea God Continent, he was only about sixty years old, which was extremely young for a martial artist.</p>

  <p>However, with this sigh, he seemed to have become much older.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at Maurice and said coldly, "You haven't answered me yet. Do you have a bad memory?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's words, many of the ogre top-level war lords revealed expressions of fear.</p>

  <p>Before, Luo Luo Zheng had said that he would kill any ogre he saw in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Was he really going to fulfill this promise?</p>

  <p>Maurice hesitated for a moment before saying, "We'll leave now."</p>

  <p>"Leave?" As Luo Luo Zheng pointed at the corpses on the ground, a cold smile appeared on his face. "You want to leave after killing top-level war lords of our human race?"</p>

  <p>Maurice snorted, "What else do you want? Even if you control the Tower of Sin, you can't afford to offend the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng burst out into a fit of violent laughter, but there wasn't the slightest trace of a smile in his eyes; there was only the intent to kill. "The Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place? Do you think I'm afraid of them?"</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to make his move, Esther stopped him. "Luo Luo Zheng, how about we let them go?"</p>

  <p>The top-level war lords in front of them could be considered the backbone of the ogres. They would become war sages and even Soul Sea Realm masters in the future. If Luo Luo Zheng killed them all, it would be a heavy blow to their sacred places.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this was tantamount to offending the ogres. Esther took the overall situation into consideration. If Luo Luo Zheng really forced the ogres in the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place into a corner, then there was a high chance that the Purple Heart Sacred Place of the humans would be razed to the ground.</p>

  <p>"I know what you're thinking," Luo Luo Zheng said to Esther. "But today, all the ogres have to die!"</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he jumped down from the stairs and sped toward Maurice.</p>

  <p>"You dare?" An ogre top-level war lord could no longer hold back and rushed toward Luo Luo Zheng. As he charged forward, the forceful energy within his body erupted.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng waved his finger gently, and an invisible force instantly enveloped his opponent. Then, everyone heard the sound of cloth tearing.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh!"</p>

  <p>The ogre top-level war lord was soon torn into pieces, his brown blood splashing all over the ground.</p>

  <p>"I'll offer your bodies to the Tower of Sin as sacrifices!" Luo Zheng's face was ferocious and his entire body was brimming with a strong malicious Mu Ning, as if he was a god of death that had descended into the world.</p>

  <p>As Maurice realized that Luo Luo Zheng had really meant his words, his expression changed. He turned to his clansmen. "Retreat! Leave the Tower of Sin!"</p>

  <p>Knowing they were in danger, many of the ogre top-level war lords rushed at lightning speed to the rear where there was a staircase to the 14th floor.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, they had arrived at the entrance of the staircase.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng wasn't going to let them go just like that. A crack appeared on the ceiling above him and he jumped into it, blocking the entrance to the 14th floor. He wasn't going to let a single one of these ogres escape!</p>

  <p>The ogre top-level war lords had just climbed up to the 14th floor from the top of the tower and seen Luo Luo Zheng blocking their way at the entrance. They looked at him in fear as if he was a humanoid devil.</p>

  <p>"Let's fight him! After all, he's just a war general!"</p>

  <p>"Kill him! No matter what, we will die!" Several ogre top-level war lords roared.</p>

  <p>Their towering bodies looked like small mountains as they swarmed forward.</p>

  <p>Once again, Luo Luo Zheng gently lifted his finger, tearing the ogres into pieces with an invisible force. Their corpses were scattered all over the steps of the Tower of Sin, and Luo Luo Zheng confidently walked up those blood-stained steps.</p>

  <p>"Devil! He's a devil!" Realizing that they were far from being a match for Luo Luo Zheng, the ogre top-level war lords desperately tried to retreat, running back toward the top of the tower. However, Luo Luo Zheng didn't give them a chance to leave. He chased after them and activated the power of the weapon spirit inside the Tower of Sin, swiftly strangling all the top-level war lords.</p>

  <p>"Ahhhh!"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>The screams of all the top-level war lords rang out, and the corpses splattered everywhere. It was as if the steps had turned into a terrifying scene of carnage.</p>

  <p>Most of the war lords on the 14th floor were used to bloody scenes, but after they witnessed this scene, their faces went pale with shock. In the past, they'd envied the ogres very much and even regretted not being ogres.</p>

  <p>However, they couldn't do anything to change their identities. All they could do was resenting the fact that their races weren't strong enough.</p>

  <p>But now, for the first time, they felt glad that they weren't ogres; otherwise, they would have met a cruel end just like these ogres.</p>

  <p>Taking one step at a time, Luo Luo Zheng slowly made his way to the top of the tower where Maurice had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Has he entered one of the small worlds?" Luo Luo Zheng swept the area with his gaze but he couldn't find Maurice. There were 128 small worlds at the top of the tower, so Luo Luo Zheng wondered whether Maurice had escaped into one of them.</p>

  <p>Yolande shook her head and pointed to the top of the stairs. "Maurice rushed out of there."</p>

  <p>"What? He rushed out of there?" A trace of surprise flashed across Luo Zheng's face. "Isn't he afraid that the Dark Nether Death Light will directly shoot him to death?"</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Luo Zheng didn't give up on the chase. Since the ogres could make breakthroughs in the Tower of Sin and become war sages, their secret must be hidden at the bottom of the tower. As for what the secret was, Luo Luo Zheng had no idea, but he knew that Maurice wouldn't kill himself just like that.</p>

  <p>Thus, Luo Luo Zheng channeled his life vitality into the pendant on his chest, and an orange protective barrier appeared around him. Then, he walked up the stairs and entered the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>Yolande, Esther, Fabian, and Jarrod all followed him. Xun also appeared beside Luo Luo Zheng. Luo Luo Zheng was invincible in the Tower of Sin, but outside the tower, it wouldn't be easy for him to fight Maurice alone. If Maurice really had a way to protect himself from death, Luo Luo Zheng would be in trouble.</p>

  <p>Outside of the top of the tower, a thick Dark Nether Death Light spread out.</p>

  <p>This fatal light could shatter the life vitality that protected warriors in just a few seconds before killing them all.</p>

  <p>After reaching the top of the tower, Luo Luo Zheng flew around with a trace of suspicion on his face. He still hadn't found any trace of Maurice.</p>

  <p>But Maurice couldn't be too far away. He wouldn't be able to resist the effect of the Dark Nether Death Light at all. With that thought, Luo Luo Zheng closed his eyes and gradually released his senses to slowly investigate his surroundings.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, he sneered. He took out a top-grade sacred long sword from his space ring and slowly approached in a certain direction.</p>

  <p>Fabian, Esther, and the others exchanged glances. Had Luo Luo Zheng really discovered something?</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, a burly figure appeared from the side of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Maurice had been hiding there.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, since you want to die, die with me!" Maurice roared.</p>

  <p>There was a dazzling flash of light above his head. Maurice had unexpectedly chosen to burn his spiritual altars!</p>

  <p>A martial artist that cultivated the life vitality system could cause his belly to explode and fight to the death with his opponent. A body refiner, on the other hand, could burn his own spiritual altars. If he chose to do so, the power of the forceful energy released would be appalling.</p>

  <p>However, this choice was irreversible. Once the spiritual altar was burned, it couldn't be rebuilt.</p>

  <p>As a body refiner, Maurice had already had three spiritual altars. The power released by the burning of the spiritual altars was truly great. Although Luo Luo Zheng continued to look indifferent, Esther and the rest all had a drastic change in expression.</p>

  <p>"Attack him!"</p>

  <p>Esther, Fabian, Jarrod, Yolande, and Xun launched an attack at the same time.</p>

  <p>Esther's strength alone was on par with Maurice's, but since Maurice had chosen to burn his spiritual altars, his Mu Ning and strength had increased exponentially. He was now so powerful that he could singlehandedly resist all of their attacks.</p>

  <p>"Don't kid yourselves! You can't resist me!" As Maurice roared, a dense stream of fist radiance shot out from his hand. It was as if no one could stop him!</p>
