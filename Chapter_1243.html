  <p>
</p>

  <p>What was amazing was that the eight puppets were all true to life. Every single one of them was the exact replica of the people in the group.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sized up the puppets. Finally, his gaze landed on the puppet that resembled him. He was shocked and disappointed. "Why is my puppet weaker than all of yours?"</p>

  <p>The materials used to make these puppets were very complicated. The strength of the seven puppets of the seven Celestial Position masters was equivalent to that of a Life and Death Realm warrior. However, Luo Zheng's puppet's strength was equivalent to that of a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>Woody retorted, "Isn't that accurate? After all, you are still a lot weaker than us!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng rolled his eyes. He didn't want to waste time arguing with this fellow.</p>

  <p>Max spoke up, "Anyway, it's all done. Now we can control these puppets and enter the Cursed Land."</p>

  <p>Everyone nodded their heads. They had been waiting for some days and now they were eager to enter the Tower of Crystal. Everyone poured a part of their souls into their corresponding puppets. One after another, the puppets opened their eyes and came to life.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was lost at this point. He didn't know how to "split his soul", so he wasn't able to pour a part of it into his puppet.</p>

  <p>While his soul was very close to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm, he hadn't actually stepped into the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>So he hadn't practiced the soul-splitting technique. He could only control the shape of his own soul for now.</p>

  <p>Splitting the soul involved peeling off a part of one's soul to form a single entity, which was completely independent.</p>

  <p>Xun's soul was actually a fragment. Her physical body and main soul had already perished, thus that soul fragment was now her only remaining soul.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng just didn't know what to do! Woody flashed a mocking smile, enjoying Luo Zheng's obvious discomfort. Thankfully Dorothea offered to help.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, let me help you. First, detach part of your soul from your body," she explained.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did as Dorothea instructed. He squeezed out a portion of his soul from the spot between his eyebrows. Then, the flower in Dorothea's right eye turned slightly, and an invisible force gently floated out. Luo Luo Zheng felt the light pull of this force, and a wisp of his soul separated from the main soul.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Luo Zheng was able to control this portion of his soul. He poured it into his own puppet and brought it to life.</p>

  <p>The eight of them sat down on the floor solemnly, while the eight puppets hopped onto the Eight-diagram Wheel. They didn't waste any more time and immediately took off to the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>The puppets would not be effected by the Cursed Land. The Eight-diagram Wheel didn't pause and directly entered the area. Soon, a huge tower appeared in front of everyone's eyes. It was the Tower of Sin, also the Tower of Crystal called by the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>"That's it," said Max's puppet excitedly, "It really is the Tower of Crystal!"</p>

  <p>"It seems that the Tower of Crystal hasn't been fully unfolded yet,"</p>

  <p>Delroy observed.</p>

  <p>Max nodded and said, "Yes, it isn't fully developed!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face was full of curiosity, as he asked, "Fully developed? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Max smiled and replied, "You'll understand soon."</p>

  <p>Whoosh?</p>

  <p>Hank's puppet was controlling the Eight-diagram Wheel. He quickly landed it at the entrance of the first floor of the Tower of Crystal.</p>

  <p>Many creatures from the different races of the Sea God Continent stared at this mysterious sight of the Eight-diagram Wheel with the puppets on it.</p>

  <p>Nobody on the Sea God Continent was skilled in making puppets. They did not see any signs of life in these puppets. Everyone was intrigued and immediately launched into a frenzied discussion about this alien phenomenon.</p>

  <p>"What are these things? They don't seem to be humans!"</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng! Oh no! One of them looks like Luo Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Has he returned to the Sea God Continent? Look closely, these fellows seem to be made from Mica gold... But what exactly are they?"</p>

  <p>Max ignored all the creatures who were watching them and walked directly towards the Tower of Crystal. At the sight of these Celestial Position warriors, the two Giants guarding the entrance quickly pulled open the gates. Even though they were puppets, they had strength comparable to the Life and Death Realm and they were controlled by Spirit Supreme Realm masters. No one in the Tower of Sin could be their match.</p>

  <p>As they entered and started climbing up the floors, they attracted the attention of countless creatures inside.</p>

  <p>One floor, two floors, three floors, four floors...</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng started climbing up from the ground floor, familiar scenes from the tower came into his view, triggering many past memories. He never thought he would actually return to the Tower of Sin, and in such a form.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng lamented the days gone by.</p>

  <p>Looking at his aggrieved expression, Woody laughed maliciously and remarked, "Your lie is about to be exposed, but why do I feel so sad?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled wryly and retorted, "Someone's about to swallow his own weapon. I am also feeling very sad."</p>

  <p>Woody was startled at his confidence. Could it be that he had really obtained the golden Celestial Position title from the Talent Tablet?</p>

  <p>Impossible! Woody shook his head, his face filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>As for the others, they didn't bother worrying about it at this point. The truth would unveil itself. After reaching the tenth floor, everything would become clear.</p>

  <p>The ongoing battle on the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin was still as intense as ever!</p>

  <p>As soon as the group reached the tenth floor, they saw a group of people surrounding the Talent Tablet. It seemed that someone had entered the Tablet to take the test.</p>

  <p>Max took a few steps but suddenly stopped and craned his neck to see above the heads of the creatures of various races. He stared at the wall in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's name was right on the top, above the first row. There was no need to squeeze into the crowd to read it. This was the reason for Max's abrupt halt.</p>

  <p>Delroy had also paused. These puppets created by Hank were ingenious.</p>

  <p>Their expressions were vivid and lifelike. Delroy's gaze was complicated and he seemed to be deep in thought!</p>

  <p>Dorothea's eyes were shining bright. She chuckled softly and said,</p>

  <p>"Looks like my hunch was right!"</p>

  <p>The others were all silent. Woody's expression was the most exaggerated.</p>

  <p>His mouth was wide open and his face turned dull; he didn't know what to think at this moment.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had obtained the golden Celestial Position title from the Talent Tablet back then, many races from the Sea God Continent were shocked. However, they didn't know what the golden Celestial Position was.</p>

  <p>Amber was the most powerful talent of the Sea God Continent throughout history. And even she could only be ranked on the second row, which was probably equivalent to the second grade. However, Luo Luo Zheng was ranked above the first grade, meaning his talent was at least two grades higher than Amber's!</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Celestial Position had more clarity on the rankings of the Talent Tablet than anyone else.</p>

  <p>The ranking system consisted of three tiers, represented by three colors? golden, silver, bronze. There were various titles under each color.</p>

  <p>Although there wasn't much of a difference between two titles of the same color, there was a huge gap between the lowest title and highest one.</p>

  <p>Celestial Position was the topmost title!</p>

  <p>"Golden Celestial Position. Wow! It really is that position! Ever since Aliza became the Supreme Lord four hundred thousand years ago, there hasn't been anyone who has obtained the golden Celestial Position title,"</p>

  <p>Max muttered.</p>

  <p>Four hundred thousand years might sound like a long time, but actually it was a very short time frame, if one considered the intervals between the appearances of two golden Celestial Position titles.</p>

  <p>Judging from the measure of time, an era lasted for 3.6 billion years, and during this era, only six warriors had obtained the title of golden Celestial Position. The warrior who had obtained the golden Celestial Position before Aliza obtained it tens of millions of years ago, or even hundreds of millions of years ago. This time span was beyond imagination.</p>

  <p>Dorothea's face wore a smug expression now. She hadn't done anything to harm Luo Luo Zheng before, which was indeed the right decision on her part. She giggled and said to Woody, "Didn't someone make a bet with me?"</p>

  <p>Woody looked pale. He was a serious man. His puppet didn't have blood vessels, so it couldn't blush in embarrassment. However, his real form, which was controlling the puppet in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, had turned red in the face. Of course, he was not really going to swallow the Black Nether Saber. But he didn't know what to say to save his face.</p>

  <p>Max didn't care about this silly bet between Woody and Dorothea. He suddenly remembered something very important.</p>
