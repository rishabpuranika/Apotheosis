<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3489 Peculiar Seeds </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The first time that Luo Zheng had heard of the Finale Hero, it was from Fuxi's mouth.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had been in his lunatic phase at the time and Luo Zheng had had no idea what it had meant. No. 9527 hadn't explained it to him either.</p>

  <p>It was not until Qiu Yinhe had told him about the Finale Way while in the Mountain Viewing Province, that he had finally understood what it was about.</p>

  <p>But there were things in the world that he'd find difficult to take on as goals even if he understood what they were.</p>

  <p>There had been a number of civilizations that had pursued the Finale Way in the past. But it was a goal that even a whole civilization had failed to achieve despite summoning all their powers. Luo Zheng had never dreamed that his strength could be on par with that of a whole civilization.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a soul fluctuation emanated from the sclerite in Luo Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 had suddenly turned into a human figure and was now standing beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess didn't flinch when the human-shaped soul appeared so suddenly.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had already sensed its existence, and Fuxi had communicated with No. 9527 at the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 folded its hands in respect towards Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was usually pretty casual when communicating with Luo Zheng. But it regarded the top masters in the Source World as its peers. It hadn't cared about its manners even when it had met Chiyou in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"We meet again," said Fuxi as he returned No. 9527's salute. "I didn't expect you to still be in this man's body."</p>

  <p>"I will accompany and assist him as he grows in his strength. I won't leave until he becomes strong enough," No. 9527 answered.</p>

  <p>When a soul fragment was separated from the main soul for too long, the connection between it and its master grew more distant with time.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, No. 9527 had only assisted Luo Zheng when it thought it was necessary.</p>

  <p>But as they began to communicate more deeply with each other, No. 9527 gradually formed its own self-consciousness and began to have its own characters. It began to care more about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It looks like you've done a good job of assisting him," Fuxi said, voice dripping with jealousy. He had attributed Luo Zheng's rapid progress in cultivation to No. 9527's assistance.</p>

  <p>"My help didn't really matter. Luo Zheng was able to achieve all of this with his own efforts," No. 9527 said, shaking its head. "I actually wanted to ask for something from you. For Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>"Ask for something?" Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess looked askance at No. 9527. "What do you want from us?"</p>

  <p>"A Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed," No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>Yan's and Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed at this.</p>

  <p>The two of them had been born from the blood sealed within this kind of seeds, but they didn't exactly know what it was. What was No. 9527 doing by asking for it?</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed mischievously. She said, "The Blood-storing Tree hasn't bloomed for a long time. Even the last Six-Pattern Blood-storing Fruit has hung on the tree for a long time. The entire Li Shan mountain has only one Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. Why do you think you can ask for it?"</p>

  <p>There was only one Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree in the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>"Because Luo Zheng needs it. And he can exchange the Truth of Three-Energy Construction for it," No. 9527 said calmly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was confused "Of what use is the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed to me?"</p>

  <p>No. 9527 looked at Luo Zheng, a faint smile playing on its face. "You had previously thought of using the Blood Upgrading Pill of the Origin Mountain to upgrade my master's blood in your body. Rumors in the Taiyi Heaven Palace have it that the Blood Upgrading Pill has magical power, but it is impossible to upgrade my master's blood using the pill."</p>

  <p>"Can the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed upgrade your master's blood?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"In the whole chaos, only the seeds from this tree can perfectly copy bloodlines. Am I right?" No. 9527 said, smiling as it faced Fuxi and the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>When the Li Shan mountain had risen, this tree had started to break free from ground and grown on the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds that grew on the tree were rare treasures in the Source World.</p>

  <p>A Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed could pass down a bloodline perfectly.</p>

  <p>Many powerful masters in the Source World had their own bloodlines, but their descendants were often unable to completely inherit their bloodlines.</p>

  <p>There were a few special elixirs like the Blood Upgrading Pill of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and the Heavenly Blood Pill of the Divine Farmer race that could upgrade their bloodlines. But the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed remained the most magical of them all.</p>

  <p>Such seeds could completely pass down the bloodline one carried.</p>

  <p id="top_9">Since ancient times, there had been many powerful masters who had come to the Li Shan mountain to ask for the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds.</p>

  <p>Even King Ieuan of the Ear Mice had brought a huge amount of resources here in exchange for a Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. No superpower could reject the wealth that the Ear Mice offered for their resources.</p>

  <p>But the Li Shan mountain had refused them.</p>

  <p>They had never given their treasures to anyone else.</p>

  <p>The two Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds that had been used on Yan and Luo Zheng were exceptions. It was the only time that the seeds had been used on outsiders.</p>

  <p>A glimmer of hesitation appeared on the Snake Goddess's face. "Excuse me. Let me discuss this with Fuxi," she said.</p>

  <p>With a slight wave of her hand, the two of them disappeared from before Luo Zheng and Yan.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was stunned. It hadn't expected the Snake Goddess to be so cautious about its request. It was just a seed that could pass down the bloodline!</p>

  <p>Once the Snake Goddess had pulled Fuxi to a space where Luo Zheng couldn't hear them, she said, "What do you think, Fuxi?"</p>

  <p>Fuxi acted like he didn't really care. "He had used one before. What's the big deal if we give him another one?"</p>

  <p>"But it will be the last Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed. Do you think there's something important hidden in it?" The Snake Goddess looked hesitant.</p>

  <p>The Li Shan mountain cherished the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds so much because there were secrets hidden in them.</p>

  <p>This Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree had been born at almost the same time as Fuxi and the Snake Goddess. It was a tree that the human race had originally planted on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree would bloom once every thirty million years. Another thirty million years later, the tree would bear a fruit. And another thirty million years later, the fruit would mature. This fruit would have a Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed within it.</p>

  <p>To perfectly pass down bloodlines was just one of the functions of the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds.</p>

  <p>What made the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds really important were the things that were hidden inside them.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had discovered the Grand World Cultivation Method from one of the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds.</p>

  <p>The crystals produced by the Chaotic Source Spirits after they came to the Source World could help the warriors at the Other Shore Realm step into the Chaotic Source Realm. This secret had also been carried by a Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess believed that this Six-Pattern Blood-storing Tree was a method the human race on the Other Shore used to communicate with her.</p>

  <p>They sealed what they needed her to know into the tree and in this way, passed it to her.</p>

  <p>This was why the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds were never given to outsiders.</p>

  <p>At the time, a Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed that had been placed in Yan's body had copied the bloodline of the Snake Goddess. And then an Energy Shaft formed in her body.</p>

  <p>"Don't you know how many Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seeds we have devoured over the years?" Fuxi shook his head and said, "The information that some of the seeds contained is ridiculous. Apart from the one that Yan inherited, all others are basically useless. And you're still expecting the last one to produce a miracle?"</p>
