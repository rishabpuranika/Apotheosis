<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4167 The Trouble Of The Li Shan mountain </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once he had taken over the Source World, the Evil God had grown complacent, seeing he was in a most advantageous position.</p>

  <p>However, he never expected that the chaos would undergo tremendous change so soon.</p>

  <p>The millions of heads that were nibbling at the Source World were like leeches that latched onto the Evil God's body, sucking at his life force. If he didn't get rid of these things soon, he would be in trouble.</p>

  <p>The only solution he could think of was to mobilize the major forces in the Source World to join forces with his tens of thousands of avatars.</p>

  <p>Together, they'd launch a massive attack.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure whether he'd be able to get rid of the heads this way, but at this point, he had no other choice.</p>

  <p>Wherever there were chaos clouds, the heads would appear.</p>

  <p>From the depths of the chaos, some of the weaker races and forces were devoured by these heads.</p>

  <p>Even the famous top ten beasts in the chaos were in grave danger.</p>

  <p>At first, they traveled about the chaos quickly, fighting off these crazy enemies.</p>

  <p>However, after a while, they started to grow desperate.</p>

  <p>No matter where they went, these strange heads loomed everywhere. It seemed they occupied the entire chaos!</p>

  <p>Why was this happening? How many heads were there?</p>

  <p>No one could answer these questions.</p>

  <p>Not long after the heads showed up, the Li Shan mountain, which was flying at a high speed, also encountered them.</p>

  <p>Kendrick was the first to sense the existence of the heads, because some of the heads had crashed into his enchanted barrier, immediately alerting him to their presence.</p>

  <p>Ordinary creatures would've instantly shattered into pieces at such a violent impact. After all, the entire Li Shan mountain was moving at an incredibly high speed.</p>

  <p>Not only did those heads emerge from the blow unscathed, they opened their wide mouths to reveal rows of sharp teeth and chomped down on the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>To Kendrick's surprise, the heads seemed to be eating the enchanted barrier. This meant that these vicious heads were capable of devouring both substances and energies!</p>

  <p>"Judson, Gerald, some strange things have appeared in the chaos,"</p>

  <p>Kendrick alerted them.</p>

  <p>"We see them," Gerald said calmly from the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the chaos clouds in the distance began to surge. Countless heads emerged from the chaos clouds, all rushing towards the flying Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>"Will it be easy to deal with them?" Judson asked.</p>

  <p>"They can devour the enchanted barrier," answered Kendrick, frowning unhappily. "But it shouldn't be too hard to kill them." dozens of big and small rings suddenly appeared on the enchanted barrier on the east side of the Li Shan mountain. These rings shrank towards the heads, and then transparent swords appeared on the surface of the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>The transparent swords smashed the heads into pieces swiftly.</p>

  <p>"They have been disposed of," reported Kendrick.</p>

  <p>"Is it just this area that's problematic, or is the entire chaos filled with these things?" Gerald asked, his voice hinting at concern. "There seems to be too many of these heads."</p>

  <p>"Are they related to that terrifying energy?" Judson asked.</p>

  <p>"Who knows? Anyway, we have to be careful."</p>

  <p>Even as Kendrick spoke, the Li Shan mountain was rushing towards a large group of heads.</p>

  <p>Moments earlier, it was just a large chaos cloud. Now, it turned into thousands upon thousands of strange heads, and the Li Shan mountain was heading straight for them!</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>As soon as the heads smashed into the enchanted barrier, they sank their teeth into it and chomped on it like crazy.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell! Trillions of enchanted barrier swords!"</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier began to shake violently, as countless swords pierced through the surface of the enchanted barrier and shot towards the heads.</p>

  <p>However, more and more heads kept bumping into the enchanted barrier around the Li Shan mountain. No matter how many they killed, more took their places.</p>

  <p>"Trillions of enchanted barrier swords!"</p>

  <p>"Trillions of enchanted barrier swords!"</p>

  <p>Kendrick gritted his teeth. The situation was looking grim, but he kept on attacking the heads.</p>

  <p>Even the truth power of the Chaos Ancient God was limited. On one hand, these heads would absorb Kendrick's power, and on the other hand, using trillions of enchanted barrier swords would cost a lot of truth power.</p>

  <p>After a few more rounds, Kendrick had exhausted a lot of truth power, but the number of heads did not decrease. Instead, more and more heads appeared. Only then did he realize exactly how serious the situation was.</p>

  <p>"Gerald, Judson, you need to help me."</p>

  <p>"Judging from what we're seeing right now, we will need backup," Gerald said as he eyed the countless strange heads eating the enchanted barrier.</p>

  <p>Soon, the Eternal Realm warriors of the Li Shan mountain were gathered on the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others saw these heads, they were also extremely confused and shocked.</p>

  <p>"These heads... Where are they from?"</p>

  <p>"Why is the chaos suddenly so terrifying?"</p>

  <p>"Can you hold them off, Master Kendrick?"</p>

  <p>Kendrick replied impatiently, "No, I can't!"</p>

  <p>At this point, there were about forty thousand heads lying on the enchanted barrier of the Li Shan mountain. Kendrick's truth power was nearly completely exhausted. Once the enchanted barrier collapsed, it would be a catastrophe.</p>

  <p>"Then, we shall fight." the Snake Goddess said decisively.</p>

  <p>Then, she dragged her shadow to the surface of the enchanted barrier. The shadow that was attached to her body stretched out her hands, and tens of thousands of energy beams shot across the surface of the enchanted barrier, slicing through the heads as they went.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and Ying also quickly joined in on the action.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Blood-controlling Method, their current combined strength was definitely a force to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>With all these Eternal Realm warriors fighting side by side, all of the heads that were lying on the surface of the enchanted barrier were killed.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't long before the Li Shan mountain bumped into more heads.</p>

  <p>Some even had the audacity to chomp on Luo Zheng, the Snake Goddess and the others, trying to devour them.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and his companions swiftly got rid of the heads, but when they turned around, they frowned slightly. Even more heads had latched onto the enchanted barrier, their sharp teeth biting at it viciously.</p>

  <p>"Kill all of them!" The Snake Goddess's face crumpled with rage, and a malicious aura emanated from her body.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm warriors and the Chaos Ancient Gods continued to launch attacks on the strange heads.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng suddenly stopped. The voice of the ancestry-level bloodline from his inner world was trying to tell him something.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, it's useless for you to do this."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately stopped in his tracks. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"These things are all over the entire chaos, and there are trillions of them.</p>

  <p>How could you possibly kill them all? You will only be devoured by them, little by little, until your numbers dwindle," the ancestry-level bloodline said.</p>

  <p>"They're all over the entire chaos?" Luo Zheng asked, his expression horrified.</p>

  <p>"In a sense, these heads are your food, so there is no need for you to kill them," the ancestry-level bloodline added.</p>

  <p>"My food?" Luo Zheng's mind was whirling.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline continued, "The downgrading has begun again. Their first step is to turn the chaos into their own world."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"The more heads are devoured, the bigger the primitive land will become, until the primitive land fills the entire chaos. This is a game that only a primitive land can play," the ancestry-level bloodline said seriously.</p>

  <p>"Primitive land as big as the chaos..." A trace of fear appeared in Luo Zheng's eyes, but at the same time, he was a little confused. "Why do they do this?</p>

  <p>What does this have to do with the downgrading?"</p>
