<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All the creatures hiding throughout the Blood Swamp were shocked by the Worm Lizard's death.</p>

  <p>Despite being the dominant creature of the Blood Swamp, the Worm Lizard had easily been shredded from the inside out. This was incomprehensible to the other creatures.</p>

  <p>However, these creatures were only momentarily stunned before they swarmed into the nest of the Worm Lizard.</p>

  <p>The Worm Lizard was ginormous, and its flesh and blood contained precious substances.</p>

  <p>After devouring them, these creatures would be greatly fortified.</p>

  <p>How could they miss out on such a rare opportunity?</p>

  <p>As the blood surged wildly in the pool, the dead Worm Lizard's bones and flesh were rapidly devoured until nothing was left...</p>

  <p>Splatter...</p>

  <p>After vanquishing the Worm Lizard, Zheng's body kept charging at a huge velocity.</p>

  <p>"Alright, this Treacherous Being is extremely powerful. At least, I don't have to worry about any threats to my body." Zheng sighed.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the Treacherous Being possessed strange magical powers.</p>

  <p>It had displayed these powers on the Whining Road when it had managed to resist Fuxi's and the Snake Goddess's attacks.</p>

  <p>Now that the Treacherous Being had attached itself to Zheng's body, it had transferred the same strange power to his body. This was how it had destroyed the Worm Lizard.</p>

  <p>"When it leaves the Blood Swamp, we will be able to guess at its intended direction," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. He had no other option except to wait and see.</p>

  <p>"Here's something strange," the Primeval Lord of Heaven continued. "Why didn't your bloodline conflict with the Treacherous Being in your body?"</p>

  <p>Although the ancestry-level bloodline Zheng had been endowed with was beyond his control, it had often saved him at critical moments in the past.</p>

  <p>"Maybe the bloodline can't act against the Treacherous Being..." Zheng guessed.</p>

  <p>There could be no doubt that the ancestry-level bloodline had its own intentions. At the very least, it had displayed a reluctance to fall into the hands of the Nihility race and the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>However, when the Treacherous Being invaded Zheng's body, the ancestry-level bloodline showed no reaction to it at all.</p>

  <p>"But that's impossible!" The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline filled every cell of Zheng's body, and its presence had to have overlapped with that of the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>It was miraculous that there was no conflict between the two.</p>

  <p>"Then what else?" Zheng appeared bewildered. He was stumped for any other theory to explain it.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven thought for a long while as he considered all possibilities. His eyes suddenly lit up as a realization struck. "Your bloodline hasn't rejected the Treacherous Being. Then there is a likelihood that it is related to the Treacherous Being, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"The ancestry-level bloodline is related to the Treacherous Being..." Zheng suddenly cocked an eyebrow. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, does that mean that the Treacherous Beings are not native to the chaos, but they are creatures from the Abstruse Energy World? Or do you mean that they originate from the Four Spirits Sect?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"But the Four Spirits Sect consists of human spirits, monkey spirits, snake spirits, and bird spirits. There is no creatures like the Treacherous Beings among them," Zheng said doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Beings are not normal creatures. They possess different forms and float aimlessly throughout the year in the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>They seem to be a special kind of spirit, or rather...a special kind of soul," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had once conducted a study of the Treacherous Beings. As with most such forces, his study had ended in failure.</p>

  <p>The Treacherous Beings were lethal. Sometimes they appeared quite docile, but at other times they became extremely violent.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for the forces in the Three Purities Stage to control them by any means, so there was nothing to do except to steer clear of them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, no one knew how they came into being or how they had disappeared. Even though they had wanted to study them, they had no idea where to begin.</p>

  <p>Even so, conjectures abounded about the Treacherous Beings' origin.</p>

  <p>Since the Three Purities Stage was closely located to the Abstruse Energy World, most would always associate the mysterious beings and events in the Three Purities Stage with the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Many people viewed the Treacherous Beings as souls of the Instant Civilization. As to why these souls couldn't communicate with them or why they acted so unpredictably, there was no explanation for this either.</p>

  <p>"That is feasible. However, I was just wondering where this Treacherous Being will lead me to..." Zheng sighed with resignation.</p>

  <p>After the Blood Swamp's expansion, it now occupied a massive area and seemed almost endless.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's body crashed ahead at full speed under the Treacherous Being's control, a great number of Soul Leeches were scorched to death along the way. He broke into the nests of six or seven more Worm Lizards, slaughtering them all.</p>

  <p>After an entire day?</p>

  <p>He reached the northern edge of the Blood Swamp.</p>

  <p>The blood in the swamp was getting visibly shallower, while the temperature cooled.</p>

  <p>The Soul Leeches liked a warm environment, so there were less of these creatures in this area of the swamp. Therefore, the Worm Lizards that relied on the Soul Leeches during their hunting couldn't survive in this area either.</p>

  <p>What replaced them in the food chain was an even more ferocious creature, the Swamp Prawn.</p>

  <p>The Swamp Prawns possessed an astonishingly hard outer shell and congregated in large numbers. They usually hunted in packs and could instantly devour their prey.</p>

  <p>An important aspect of the Swamp Prawns was that they were not afraid of death. No matter the superior strength of their prey, they would bite it hard, regardless of their own injuries or possible death.</p>

  <p>But this time, they faced a prey that they couldn't tackle at all.</p>

  <p>The red Swamp Prawns pounced on Zheng in groups, but the Treacherous Being maneuvered Zheng's body, making him run wildly while swinging his arms like windmills at the same time.</p>

  <p>This might have appeared comical, but the damage dealt by his arms was formidable.</p>

  <p>Any Swamp Prawns coming in reach of his arms were instantly shredded, without exception.</p>

  <p>The Swamp Prawns were the most plentiful creatures in the Blood Swamp.</p>

  <p>There were forty to fifty thousand of them in total, and even the powerful Worm Lizards were considered their prey.</p>

  <p>However, with their failed hunt of Zheng, many of their members were slaughtered and their numbers were greatly reduced!</p>

  <p>After vanquishing the Swamp Prawns, Zheng encountered a group of scavenging black wolves.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's body was launched into a fight against the black wolves, he heard the Wing King's voice echoing from the Civilization Artifact of the Regal Jade Civilization. The Wing King and the others had left the Whining Road and entered the Supreme Pure Realm. Zheng quickly told him his current location. After confirming Zheng's location, the Wing King and the others began to soar above the Blood Swamp, chasing after Zheng.</p>

  <p>Once he had gotten rid of the black wolves, Zheng's body finally left the Blood Swamp and moved onto a barren hill.</p>

  <p>After directing his body to stand on top of the hill, the Treacherous Being suddenly seemed to have lost its way. It turned Zheng's body to look north, west, and then east by turns, as if trying to confirm where it was.</p>

  <p>"The west is the Soul-diffusing Highland, and the north is the Myriad Pagoda Mountains, while the east is the Freezing Wilderness. I am unsure of which direction the Treacherous Being will choose," the Primeval Lord of Heaven murmured.</p>

  <p>"Where are you being trapped?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The north," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied. "Beyond the Myriad Pagoda Mountains..."</p>

  <p>Had Zheng's body not been controlled by the Treacherous Being, he and the others would have successfully entered the Supreme Pure Realm together.</p>

  <p>Then, they would, of course, have gone north to rescue the real Primeval Lord of Heaven and his companions.</p>

  <p>But now, his first priority was to escape the Treacherous Being's control.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the hill beneath Zheng's feet began to violently tremble.</p>

  <p>With a great rumble, a gigantic turtle head suddenly popped out from the front of the hill, craning around to bite at Zheng.</p>

  <p>This was no "hill," instead it seemed to be a huge turtle!</p>

  <p>Before the turtle could injure Zheng, he stomped heavily on it, cracking its shell open instantly. In that moment, its head exploded into a spray of blood before it could clamp its jaws on Zheng.</p>

  <p>Then the Treacherous Being steered Zheng's body to fly away. It seemed to finally have determined where to go. It was heading towards the Myriad Pagoda Mountains in the north.</p>
