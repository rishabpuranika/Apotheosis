<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Loud footsteps ran through the jagged, rocky surface. The hairs on Zheng's back stood on their ends when he sensed danger behind him.</p>

  <p>He continued to run away from the imminent peril, but it turned out to be useless. He knew where the danger came from, but he simply couldn't get rid of it!</p>

  <p>He finally thought that since he couldn't get away, he'd have to turn back and fight!</p>

  <p>With that in mind, Zheng jumped up and turned around in the air. He saw that Aldrich had gotten close to his back and several bone spikes from his body got closer as well. The nearest one was only several feet away from his nose.</p>

  <p>"Get it off!" a sudden scream was heard.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>A five-clawed black dragon had abruptly emerged above Zheng's head and gave a loud roar. Its great, slender body directly swooped downwards from the sky.</p>

  <p>Before, Aldrich was able to dodge that black dragon's attack, but the dragon didn't disappear. Now, Zheng had it under his control and commanded it to stay parallel above him all the time.</p>

  <p>After all, Zheng's personal skills were quite useless. There was nothing he could do for now except control this huge black dragon to defend himself against the enemy.</p>

  <p>Now, if Aldrich really decided to risk everything and wanted to kill him, he could end up dead even if Aldrich was under the attack of the huge five-clawed dragon.</p>

  <p>If Aldrich decided not to, he could have a chance of survival.</p>

  <p>However, Aldrich didn't want to resign himself to not fighting back. He saw his opponent was close at hand and he could kill Zheng immediately, but the damned five-clawed black dragon in the sky quickly rushed down.</p>

  <p>"Hah, do you think that you can run away?" Aldrich said disapprovingly.</p>

  <p>He flapped his large, scaly wings and maneuvered strangely to the side.</p>

  <p>He seemed to wait for the black dragon to turn away before he attacked Zheng again.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, that didn't turn out to be the case for Aldrich.</p>

  <p>Across him, a smile playfully danced on Zheng's lips as he slightly waved his index finger. The black dragon then rushed down and suddenly changed its direction, then flew towards him. When it got nearer, it unexpectedly swallowed Zheng in whole!</p>

  <p>The huge five-clawed black dragon was made from Zheng's demonic life energy, so when he was inside the dragon's body, he didn't get hurt, but was able to control the dragon to wrap him up.</p>

  <p>Apparently, Aldrich never thought that Zheng would use this skill. For one second Aldrich was already determined to take his life, but now he was completely hidden deep inside the body of the black dragon. Aldrich couldn't do anything to him anymore.</p>

  <p>"Quack…" Aldrich screeched. dozens of livid bone spikes suddenly came out from his body.</p>

  <p>The bone spikes hurled themselves towards the black dragon's body. The sharp ends penetrated it through, but Aldrich couldn't find Zheng. He could only shoot randomly without an aim.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng silently lay on the bottom of the black dragon and remained perfectly still. Bone spikes continued to fly back and forth above his head. He was calm on the outside, but he really felt scared. He had to depend on luck this time.</p>

  <p>After a while, luck was on his side after all as not one bone spike hit him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Aldrich couldn't do anything to Zheng. He opened his mouth which revealed rows and rows of sharp teeth, then a deep howl resonated from within him. His scaly wings flapped and lifted him up to leave. He was heavily injured, and if something went wrong he would die in this place.</p>

  <p>Just when Aldrich was about to flee, a blood-colored enchanted barrier suddenly appeared behind him.</p>

  <p>"Blood Prison Enchantment!"</p>

  <p>"Life-breaking Enchantment!"</p>

  <p>"Nine-edged Enchantment!"</p>

  <p>It turned out to be Yolande, who finally showed her trump card!</p>

  <p>In fact, she had prepared for this for a long time. It took her quite a while until she perfected all of the three enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>If Aldrich had escaped in the beginning. Yolande probably couldn't stop that. Aldrich's real strength was still much more powerful than Yolande's, after all. Even if he was seriously injured, he somehow managed to run away.</p>

  <p>However, because Zheng irritated Aldrich and he chased him, Yolande had a chance to use the secret skill to recover a part of the life vitality and also, launch three kinds of powerful enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>Now, any of the three enchanted barriers was extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>The peripheral vision of Aldrich still showed him that and he suddenly dashed to the edge. The first enchanted barrier was smashed, but the second layer had blocked him. The blood prison enchantment was immediately restored to its original state as well and had restricted Aldrich in its grip once again.</p>

  <p>If only Aldrich was at his peak condition, even the three enchanted barriers would be no match against him. They were lucky that he was severely wounded now and couldn't break free.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, control your five-clawed black dragon to rush into the enchanted barriers!" a low voice was suddenly heard. It was Yolande, who floated in the sky not too far away.</p>

  <p>To be honest, Zheng actually didn't want to follow Yolande. He had no reason to listen to her at all, but after having thought about it for a while, he finally realized it was a chance to kill the demon king and as a human, he didn't find any reason to let that go.</p>

  <p>In that case, Zheng slightly shook his finger. The black dragon started to move again and directly lunged at Aldrich.</p>

  <p>As the black dragon hurled itself forward, Yolande controlled the three enchanted barriers. A hole appeared on each of them, and the black dragon passed through the holes.</p>

  <p>Like a mouse trapped in a cage, Aldrich dashed from left to right in the small and narrow passage of the enchanted barriers. He couldn't break them but his eyes darted to the huge, five-clawed black dragon under Zheng's control rushing towards him.</p>

  <p>When he realized that there was no way for him to escape death, Aldrich reluctantly soared into the sky and said, "Humans, you will pay a huge price sooner or later. Ah…!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Just as the dragon had neared Aldrich, the demon king's body exploded into flames when he committed suicide by using his demonic core.</p>

  <p>The scene of a demon king committing this type of explosion suicide was horrible to see.</p>

  <p>The dark energy from the explosion started to rise up gradually at crazily high speed and expand throughout the area. Yolande's three enchanted barriers had only restricted it for a while, before it suddenly burst out in a resounding wave with a loud, booming sound.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>After Aldrich had done the suicide, the light curtain under Zheng's feet suddenly disappeared. He couldn't fly, and the resulting impact from the explosion pushed him to the ground.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Yolande was pushed back by the impact wave as well and her body was driven backward at a long distance. Her emotionless eyes caught a glimpse of Zheng who fell to the ground. Her snow-white figure suddenly flashed and rushed hurriedly towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>When she had reached him, she gently waved a small hand above his body. Six more transparent enchanted barriers flew above to cover Zheng and formed a square enchanted box to lock him in.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the transparent enchanted box around him, and he didn't know if he should laugh or cry.</p>

  <p>He was locked in this way when he went up, and when he came down, he was locked again--but it was better now. He didn't need to squat unfairly this time…</p>

  <p>After a short while, Yolande finally controlled the enchanted box and fell on the ground gracefully beside Zheng.</p>

  <p>Among the dark, thick cumulus clouds in the sky, the remaining ordinary demon king and Oceiros witnessed Aldrich's successful suicide attempt.</p>

  <p>Once they had realized that the general trend of attacking the city was gone, they flapped their huge leathery wings and called their troops back.</p>

  <p>They formed themselves into a black line and swiftly retreated right after.</p>

  <p>Spencer and the other powerful men of Illuminating Soul Realm saw that the demon kings had retreated and knew that the humans had won the battle. They sighed with utter relief, and their forces flew back consecutively to White Emperor City.</p>

  <p>The flames from the war in White Emperor City began to die down at the same time. The demon soldiers and generals attacking the city retreated, and the imperial army chased them away.</p>

  <p>"Hey, when will you let me go out?" Zheng asked. He knocked at the transparent enchanted box and waited for Yolande's answer.</p>

  <p>In turn, Yolanda placed her hands behind and faced Zheng. Her face wore an indifferent expression as she said, "Why should I let you go out?"</p>

  <p>At her response, Zheng's eyebrows knitted together in fury.</p>

  <p>"I, I have saved your life anyway!" Zheng shouted angrily.</p>

  <p>However, Yolande simply blinked at him. "If you didn't save me, you would die--so it is not that you saved my life but you saved yourself," she said.</p>

  <p>"..." Zheng could not respond to that. After he thought about it for a while, he stated, "Even so, you don't need to lock me up all the time!"</p>

  <p>"After sending you to the Military Office, I can let you go," Yolande replied.</p>

  <p>When he heard Yolande's last words, Zheng felt relieved. Under this situation, the Military Office of the imperial army wouldn't get him in trouble. While he did kill a counselor of the army from Zhuge family, he had also helped the army slay a demon king just now. That was a huge deal, so he believed that even Hugh wouldn't bother him again.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, the powerful men of Illuminating Soul Realm finally descended from the sky one by one. Lennie and Spencer walked towards Yolande as soon as they landed.</p>

  <p>When he saw Zheng was still bound by the enchanted box, Spencer's eyes stared at Yolande. "Yolande, be quick and let Zheng come out. Why do you have to lock him up till now?" he said.</p>

  <p>But, Yolande only shook her head. "I will let him come out after giving him to the Military Office!" she firmly said.</p>

  <p>The others, including Lennie and Hugh, had heard what Yolande said and stroked their temples in exasperation. This girl was truly extremely stubborn! Even under such dire circumstances, she still insisted on sending Zheng to the Military Office!</p>

  <p>Now, Lennie was not pleased by her decision.</p>

  <p>"Yolande, you can't send him to the Military Office!" he said.</p>

  <p>The girl's steely gaze turned to look at him.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she simply asked.</p>

  <p>"Because he has done a meritorious deed just now. He is a hero and has saved our White Emperor City!" he explained.</p>

  <p>The powerful men of Illuminating Soul Realm, including Lennie and Spencer wouldn't usually get into a conflict with Yolande at ordinary times.</p>

  <p>They had defended White Emperor City for a long time, and clearly knew about Yolande's character and attitude.</p>

  <p>However, today would be different -- Lennie told himself that he wouldn't make any compromise.</p>
