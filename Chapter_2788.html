<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2788 Taking Actions </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings stared and observed the woman's expression, trying to find out whether she was telling the truth.</p>

  <p>But in the end, they realized that they could only sense resentment coming from her. They couldn't detect any other disguised intentions no matter from which angle or point of view they checked.</p>

  <p>"Shall we go down now?"</p>

  <p>"What if it's a trap?"</p>

  <p>"We have come this far, and I won't return even if it is a trap!"</p>

  <p>Discussions of agreement and contradictions among the Holy Beings and the Demi-holy Beings began to arise. Although the consummate True Gods also tried to join the discussion, their opinions were almost ignored.</p>

  <p>"Let's go down!"</p>

  <p>Nicholas suddenly intervened, and halted the other Holy Beings just as they were discussing fiercely.</p>

  <p>Ever since the beginning of their journey, he tried to avoid all of the unnecessary fights. No matter if it was the fiends or even the mysterious woman, he had been trying not to offend anyone trivial on the way.</p>

  <p>Now that he had finally found the supreme treasure of belief that could control the Abyss Demon Region, he naturally wouldn't let the opportunity go.</p>

  <p>He had his own observations and judging from the woman's actions, and he eventually figured something out.</p>

  <p>The woman had stayed around for so many years but was not able to obtain the supreme treasure of belief. It surely proved that it was extremely difficult to do so.</p>

  <p>He realized that the woman's main intention by leading the Holy Beings into the ice palace was to simply create their replicas.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter what kind of method she had used to copy them. Her plan was to rely on the replicas of the Holy Beings to help her. Was her real target the True Demon Body too?</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings stopped discussing upon hearing Nicholas making the decision. They did not dare say anything against him.</p>

  <p>Nicholas plainly cast a meaningful glance at the woman and then jumped down.</p>

  <p>The rest of the Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings, and consummate True Gods also followed and jumped down from the above.</p>

  <p>As the woman had removed the black mist covering the area below them, there had been no obstacles on their way down.</p>

  <p>She continued to be seated on the edge of the ice as she looked down at the group's departure. With pursed lips, she reached out her arm and gently pressed the ice. Her whole body spread into the darkness silently. The replicas of the Holy Beings hidden behind her had also quietly flown away with her.</p>

  <p>The black mist was powerful enough to block the energy waves as it shrouded the ice palace.</p>

  <p>However, the vibration caused by the Holy Beings fighting was still scattered along the walls, pillars, and the ground of the ice palace spreading to all directions.</p>

  <p>The vibration contained a very subtle ripple as it spread and had gradually reached Zheng's location. He was able to perceive it as he was staying close to the ice.</p>

  <p>"Some people are fighting," Zheng muttered in the dark.</p>

  <p>"I can also sense it," followed by the copied Zheng just right across him.</p>

  <p>Zheng's complete replica was almost perfect, fully copying the same sensibility, which was the reason he was also capable to detect the vibration.</p>

  <p>Hearing his words, Zheng said, "Since you have copied everything of me, you should have the same memory as mine."</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Zheng's replica laughed in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Then why do you still have to be obedient to that woman?" Zheng asked staring at the darkness despite of not seeing anything.</p>

  <p>"Because I'm not the real you after all. I was created by her." Zheng's replica responded as a matter of fact.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head in the dark. He knew that this was not the real reason and there was still a hidden intention behind the woman's action.</p>

  <p>It was still a wonder how the woman had the ability to clone him and make a replica. Could she perform that skill freely?</p>

  <p>Was it related to the Sea of Meditation? Then what was the purpose of the black mist covering the whole ice palace all of a sudden?</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng's mind was in a mess, a subtle sound suddenly came from above him!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Zheng's replica, who had been sitting opposite to him, suddenly stood up and jumped up. At the same time, he drew his sword and swiftly slashed upwards!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A sharp sword radiance shot upwards.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>As the attack moved upwards, a strong internal momentum from above shot down as well. Another sword radiance descended against the attack.</p>

  <p>Ding!</p>

  <p>As the two beams of sword radiance clashed against each other, Zheng's eyes suddenly flashed with realization. He immediately jumped up, and harshly shouted, "Stop!"</p>

  <p>He moved in as fast as he could, and blocked the attacks from his replica and from Sword Chen coming from above.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was immediately taken aback by this weird scene in front of him.</p>

  <p>He had been lurking in the Sea of Meditation for countless years, but had never met the mysterious woman in the past. He was never aware of what was going on in the ice palace.</p>

  <p>Looking at the scene before him, astonishment was obvious on his face. He had been searching for Zheng through his long sword inserted in the Sea of Meditation until this very moment he finally succeeded. He managed to find him but was taken aback only to see another Zheng. He was looking at two figures of Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?"</p>

  <p>It was impossible for him to tell the difference between the two Zhengs.</p>

  <p>He immediately used his spiritual sense to scan them, and found that their aura and appearance were all the same.</p>

  <p>The only difference was that the Zheng, who had attacked him, seemed to have been injured and his aura was a little weaker.</p>

  <p>"He's just a replica," Zheng spoke, pointing at his replica behind him.</p>

  <p>"A replica?"</p>

  <p>Sword Chen's eyes narrowed with confusion.</p>

  <p>The replicas created by some powerful warriors could perfectly resemble the real people, but the real masters could usually discern the fake one at a glance. Sword Chen originally had the confidence to do so.</p>

  <p>But he was proven wrong at this situation. He could not even see through this replica in front of him at all.</p>

  <p>Just then...</p>

  <p>His train of thought was broken as he suddenly sensed several powerful auras in the distance!</p>

  <p>The black mist around them rolled away, and an illuminating flame lit up the space.</p>

  <p>As the flame grew, several people emerged and walked out from it. The surroundings became clear as the darkness slowly dissipated. They looked at the figures closely as their visions became clear. They were Clark, Nicholas and other Holy Beings. At that point of realization, the looks on Zheng's and Sword Chen's faces suddenly changed dramatically!</p>

  <p>They realized that the encounter with the Holy Beings at this place had given them no way to escape.</p>

  <p>Both of their faces darkened at the sight of the group who had emerged from the flame. The intense silence was then broken as a woman's silvery laughter sounded.</p>

  <p>"Did I scare you?"</p>

  <p>The mysterious woman asked as she slowly walked out from behind the Holy Beings, her gaze fixated at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was still in confusion and failed to figure out the situation, but the silence of the Holy Beings made him feel quite strange.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned and observed the Holy Beings for a while before he asked,</p>

  <p>"Are these Holy Beings also replicas?"</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh."</p>

  <p>The woman made a leap and flew towards him.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was still on full alert. He pointed his sword at the woman.</p>

  <p>For some reason, he had felt that this woman's aura was quite similar to that of the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>He was given a surprise as the woman was not afraid of his sword at all.</p>

  <p>She stretched out her slender fingers and gently brushed on the sword.</p>

  <p>Under the light of the flame, he found out that some black energies were wildly twirling on his sword!</p>

  <p>"What a strong force of primitive fear!"</p>

  <p>He cried out in exclamation staring at his long sword with an incredible look on his face.</p>

  <p>He had carefully placed one hundred and twenty-eight long swords at the bottom of the Sea of Meditation. His strength could be increased greatly with the help of the force of primitive fear.</p>

  <p>With this additional power, he was able to fight against Samuel as a Demi-holy Being.</p>

  <p>Now when the woman gave a gentle stroke to his sword, the force of primitive fear that gathered on his sword was over ten times more than what he had collected!</p>

  <p>Who the hell was this woman?</p>

  <p>And what did Zheng mean by saying those words just now? Could it be that the Holy Beings in front of them were also replicas created by her?</p>
