<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2868 The Choice Of The Moon Clan </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What's at the end of the maze?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Mike shook his head and said, "I don't know. I've never been to that maze."</p>

  <p>"Does Mother know anything about it?" Luo Zheng tried again.</p>

  <p>Mike smiled and explained, "The Nine Li race doesn't have a thorough understanding of the divine land, so your mother doesn't know much about it either. But Bromley believes that the key to controlling the divine land lies in that maze."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised his eyebrows at that.</p>

  <p>The divine land was independent ever since it was set free by Chiyou. If they could reign over the divine land in place of Chiyou, then neither the union of the powerful clans nor the Other Shore Realm enemies would be a problem for them anymore.</p>

  <p>This sure clarified some things but Luo Zheng still couldn't figure out one thing.</p>

  <p>A world in the universe would eventually develop its own will as time passed by.</p>

  <p>The divine land had been out of Chiyou's control for a long time now but it didn't seem to have developed its own will yet. Luo Zheng couldn't fathom the reason behind this.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was deep in thought when he suddenly heard Augustus's voice coming from the outer hall, "Some Holy Beings have come into the Swirl Forest."</p>

  <p>"Holy Beings?" Mike's face darkened at this information.</p>

  <p>"Who are these people?" Hallet asked.</p>

  <p>"It's Moon from the Moon Sect and Woodruff from the War God Hall,"</p>

  <p>Augustus replied.</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Mike walked out quickly and ordered, "Let them in!"</p>

  <p>Moon and Woodruff were surprised when they saw Mike. His revival from the universe was known only to the Holy Being of the Bai Clan, while the rest knew nothing about it.</p>

  <p>However, they soon recovered from their confusion. After all, the Dongfang Clan had lost its past glory. Now, although the Floating Island of the Dongfang Clan still remained above the Time Sea, the clan was doomed to decline. As a result, they could no longer imprison Mike.</p>

  <p>"Long time no see, Moon and Woodruff," Mike greeted them amicably with a smile.</p>

  <p>Moon saluted to him and said, "Congratulations! I didn't know that you've already returned. I am so glad to see you again!"</p>

  <p>Back when the Luo Clan was in trouble, both the Sword Clan and the Moon Clan had chosen to be silent spectators instead of offering to help.</p>

  <p>After all, at that time, the Dongfang Clan was quite prosperous, so the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan didn't have the resources to protect anybody other than themselves.</p>

  <p>They were meeting Mike today after that episode, so there was a trace of apology in Moon's tone.</p>

  <p>As for Mike, he didn't mind that too much. In fact, if he was the leader of the Moon Clan, he would have done the same.</p>

  <p>"So what brings you here today?" Mike asked.</p>

  <p>Moon looked at Hallet and sighed. "Some days ago, Hallet visited our clan to discuss an alliance. We had decided to wait and see the Sword Clan's attitude. But now, the situation seems to have changed."</p>

  <p>Sensing that there was an undertone in his words, Mike asked, "What exactly happened on the Floating Islands?"</p>

  <p>"Samuel has gone too far. He wants to rule over the entirety of the Time Sea! He is relentless in his pursuit." Woodruff said angrily before Moon could get a word out.</p>

  <p>"The entire Time Sea?" Mike was confounded. "That's an impossible mission for him to undertake alone. Could it be that?"</p>

  <p>"Samuel set all the Yellow Emperor Guards free," Moon explained with a sad sigh. "Having gained the support of those Yellow Emperor Guards, how could the other Holy Beings go against him?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Hallet, Harold and the rest became gloomy.</p>

  <p>"It all happened too soon, didn't it?" Harold frowned and said.</p>

  <p>"Samuel has just taken control of the Abyss Demon Region, but he released the Yellow Emperor Guards so soon. We never expected it," Hallet commented, still appearing to be in a daze.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was clear that since Samuel could gain access to all of Nicholas's memories, he would definitely replace him in a plot. It was not difficult for Samuel to do this in a short time. After all, he knew everything that Nicholas knew.</p>

  <p>"One of the Yellow Emperor Guards, called Leyton, killed Gibson and said that he has the means to kill every Holy Being with no chance of them being reborn ever again," remarked Moon calmly.</p>

  <p>He described what he had seen in the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Samuel required you to reply within a month? And all the Holy Beings have to join them? He..." Mike said bitterly.</p>

  <p>"He has gone too far now!" Woodruff was furious!</p>

  <p>"Then what do you plan to do about this?" Mike asked Moon with a look of determination in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards released from the Mixed Element Seals were merciless. This would mark a watershed in the divine land's history.</p>

  <p>If the Holy Beings enlisted in the alliance, irrespective of being reluctant or willing, it would mean that they were against the Nine Li race and would become their potential opponents.</p>

  <p>"I don't care what you think, Moon. I swear that our War God Hall will never join them!" Woodruff said firmly.</p>

  <p>Seeing Woodruff incensed like this, Moon smiled wryly. "I didn't say that the Moon Clan will necessarily join them. We still have to discuss this with Vanessa, don't we?"</p>

  <p>"She won't listen to you," Woodruff said shortly.</p>

  <p>Vanessa was the head of the Mysterious Soul Building.</p>

  <p>Moon looked calm on the surface, but he was under great pressure inside.</p>

  <p>Faced with a group of invincible opponents, surrendering seemed to be the only way for him. However, the Moon Clan was an alliance of three forces.</p>

  <p>They had agreed long ago not to join any more forces.</p>

  <p>"To think of it, leaving the Time Sea doesn't seem to be a bad thing," Mike suddenly said.</p>

  <p>Moon shook his head. "I don't think so. If Samuel could fully control the Time Sea, it would mean that we would also have to give up the entire divine land soon. In time, there will be no room for us to live. Moreover, I don't think that he will spare us if we don't obey him."</p>

  <p>"If he doesn't let us go, we will prove to him that defeating us is no easy feat!" Woodruff said angrily.</p>

  <p>Moon glanced at him indifferently and asked, "Do you think you're a match for those Yellow Emperor Guards?"</p>

  <p>His words rendered Woodruff speechless.</p>

  <p>Strength was everything in the divine land. Since Samuel was now backed by the Yellow Emperor Guards, the rest of the Holy Beings were destined to be slaughtered if they chose not to submit to him.</p>

  <p>"Actually, we only need to wait for another three years. We'll see the results by then," Mike said suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Three years?" Moon repeated in surprise. "Is it possible that you have figured out a way to deal with them?"</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of the alliance were aware of the Other Shore Realm warriors from outside the divine land, but the other large clans still didn't know of their existence.</p>

  <p>Mike didn't get straight to the point and tell Moon everything. Instead, he said, "We do have a way of defeating them. As for what kind of method we will use, we won't be able to inform you until the intention of the Moon Clan is clear to us."</p>

  <p>If the Moon Clan decided to join the alliance of the clans, they would also be treated as the enemy.</p>

  <p>"Mike, don't worry. I have already made my decision. It's out of the question for me to join the alliance of the clans and to surrender to Samuel,"</p>

  <p>Woodruff answered firmly.</p>

  <p>Despite his sincerity, Mike still cupped his hands and said, "Please visit the Swirl Forest again after the Moon Clan makes a final decision. I'll give you the answer then."</p>
