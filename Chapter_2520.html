<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As he fell rapidly into the void, the bones of the beasts at the bottom of the chaos became larger and larger in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>Cracks kept appearing in the purple light circle that enveloped Luo Zheng and eventually, it completely disappeared. It was as if Luo Zheng was sitting in a box without a lid as he fell down.</p>

  <p>'It may take a long time for me to fall to the bottom at this speed, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>The divine land itself was quite close to the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>However, calculated in the measurement of the divine land, it still felt like quite a long distance for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>A month later, Luo Zheng had finally reached the same height as those beast bones in the void.</p>

  <p>But these enormous beast bones were incredibly tall!</p>

  <p>Another ten days had passed slowly.</p>

  <p>When he was about one hundred thousand feet away from the ground, Luo Zheng jumped out, flew in the air and began to float down like a leaf.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was like a speck of dust in this mammoth world. He descended quietly without drawing any attention.</p>

  <p>"So this is the bottom of the chaos!"</p>

  <p>The ground under Luo Zheng's feet was like a vast bed of snow. The world in front of him was pristine white.</p>

  <p>This whiteness was not due to snow; it was littered with skeletons. This was a wasteland of bones!</p>

  <p>All kinds of bones were strewn everywhere: arms, ribs, lamellar bones as well as bones of various strange shapes.</p>

  <p>Some of the bones were the size of a palm, while others were tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of feet long.</p>

  <p>No matter how huge the bones were, they couldn't compare with the huge beast bones, which were as long as the divine land. They stood like many mountains in the distance that no one could conquer.</p>

  <p>"These bones must have all come from extraordinary creatures." Luo Zheng bent down and picked up a piece of bone.</p>

  <p>If the bodies of the True Gods dropped into the chaos, they would get corroded to nothingness by the chaotic energy. So these bones certainly didn't belong to the True Gods.</p>

  <p>These bones might have been at the bottom of the chaos for countless years. They were actually all intact under the cover of the chaotic energy, so perhaps only the bodies of extraordinary creatures could have withstood the erosion of the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>But so many extraordinary creatures had died here.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze once again fell on the giant beast bones that shot up towards the sky in the distance. He could still see the red beam of light from where he stood.</p>

  <p>Harold had said that the red beam of light belonged to the Out-of-Land Fiends, but he didn't know what kind of race they were.</p>

  <p>While he was deep in thought, he suddenly heard a rustling sound.</p>

  <p>He turned his head and saw seven or eight scantily-clad human-shaped creatures wandering among the bones.</p>

  <p>"Humans?" Luo Zheng said aloud and frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>They indeed looked like humans in appearance, but they were crawling on the ground on their hands and feet. Their empty eyes glistened with greed, and occasionally they bared their sharp white teeth.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, hoo!"</p>

  <p>One of them hid under a large bulk of bone and jumped up like a nimble ape and raced towards Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned with this sneak attack. He turned around and flailed out backwards, grabbing hold of the creature's head and twisted it gently.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack! Crack!"</p>

  <p>As a result, the creature's body was twisted into a pretzel by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It is not a human being, but a humanoid beast."</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng spoke, he threw the pretzel-shaped corpse on the ground. A wise human wouldn't dare to attack him in haste. A human would have at least weighed the difference in strength between the two sides before advancing.</p>

  <p>When the other humanoids saw this, the malicious light in their eyes immediately disappeared. They all fled in different directions on their hands and feet.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't chase after them. It was pointless to kill these unintelligent creatures.</p>

  <p>"The red beam of light at the top of the beast bone is draped around the entire divine land. Since I've fallen to the bottom of the chaos, I can go check it out myself!" After taking this decision, Luo Zheng flew forward.</p>

  <p>It was just as he thought? the bottom of the chaos was indeed desolate.</p>

  <p>For three days in a row, Luo Zheng encountered the unintelligent humanoids every now and then. These humanoids couldn't fly and lived like beasts on the wasteland of bones.</p>

  <p>When they saw Luo Zheng flying overhead, they would occasionally look up and roar, as if they were expressing their displeasure.</p>

  <p>On the fourth day, Luo Zheng saw over a hundred humanoids in scanty clothes scrambling on their hands and feet towards something.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" His curiosity was piqued.</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed slightly.</p>

  <p>He noticed a person sprinting in front of the humanoids.</p>

  <p>It was a young man, who could be a real human being, wearing a pale yellow beast leather covering. He ran in a panic, taking any path he could without really thinking about what could be ahead of him.</p>

  <p id="top_12">Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was flying in a straight line, suddenly changed his direction and started descending in a spiral formation towards the young man.</p>

  <p>The young man looked desperate.</p>

  <p>He was lucky enough to find three wild bones! It seemed like a risk worth taking for the sake of three wild bones.</p>

  <p>On the way back, his luck seemed to have run out and he encountered hundreds of Wights.</p>

  <p>The young man believed that he would die here today. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine that his savior would suddenly fall from the sky.</p>

  <p>Astonished as he was, he didn't stop running. All he wanted now was to survive so he ran for his life.</p>

  <p>But he heard a muffled sound behind him, and invisible fluctuations were surging in the air.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang, bang!</p>

  <p>The young man turned around and saw that seven or eight Wights were lying on the ground, their bodies twisted. They were dead.</p>

  <p>Shocked by this scene, the remaining Wights halted mid-pursuit and then scattered helter skelter.</p>

  <p>These Wights were not entirely stupid, but their IQ was very low. Seeing Luo Zheng kill their mates with ease, they knew that they could not afford to offend or take him on.</p>

  <p>Seeing the crowd of Wights dispersing, the young man breathed a sigh of relief. He then turned to Luo Zheng and stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>When he saw Luo Zheng ambling over, he took out a wild bone from his waist, knelt down on the ground, and held it up above his head as an offering.</p>

  <p>He said loudly, "This is what I collected from the wilderness. Please accept it as a token of thanks, sir!"</p>

  <p>At first, Luo Zheng was puzzled about the young man's actions.</p>

  <p>But when he heard the boy speaking the same language as him, he became less wary.</p>

  <p>Anyway, humans were present at the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>The language of the divine land was inherited from the Source World, so the creatures at the bottom of the chaos must surely have some connection with the Source World.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze was fixed on the wild bone. From its appearance, the bone was no different than an ordinary one, but he could sense extraordinary power radiating from the bone.</p>

  <p>"What kind of a bone is this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>A strange expression appeared on the young man's face, as if it was hard for him to fathom the fact that Luo Zheng didn't know about this bone.</p>

  <p>But he still replied earnestly, "This is a wild bone, sir! I just dug it out of this wilderness."</p>
