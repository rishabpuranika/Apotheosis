<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nathan casually struck the ogre martial artist with the most ordinary palm print.</p>

  <p>Once he'd made the palm print, he turned around and left without taking another look.</p>

  <p>There were countless different kinds of palm prints in the universe such as the Blessed Buddha Land's Anti-Demon Palm Print, the Immeasurable Palm Print, the Diamond Palm Print, and so on.</p>

  <p>So it was surprising that the palm print that Nathan had used was the most ordinary and unremarkable one. It was condensed from the life vitality within one's body and could be released by any martial artist.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan was still Nathan.</p>

  <p>Although he had used the most ordinary palm print, his palm print still contained the Mu Ning of a great way!</p>

  <p>When the ogre martial artist saw the palm print hovering over his head, he naturally wanted to dodge. But before he could take a step forward, he realized that he had fallen into a trance, unable to move and unable to resist.</p>

  <p>This was the power of the way.</p>

  <p>The 3000 Godly Ways were 3000 great ways.</p>

  <p>Each way had a different set.</p>

  <p>The Godly Way that Nathan practiced was a well-kept secret.</p>

  <p>This was because the Xuanyuan Clan that Nathan belonged to was a very unique clan. Out of the four great clans of the Thoughtless Minds, the Xuanyuan Clan was the most powerful one. In the other three clans, which included Lucille's Clan and Janet's Clan, Godly Geniuses had been rare and even didn't appear in some generations.</p>

  <p>In other words, the other three great clans only had ace talents and no Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>But in the Xuanyuan Clan, Godly Geniuses kept coming into being.</p>

  <p>What was more, each Godly Genius of the Xuanyuan Clan was born with a different Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Obtaining a Godly Way, such as the Ji Clan's Five Elements Godly Way, was considered an amazing thing as it rarely happened in other clans.</p>

  <p>But every time a Godly Genius was born in the Xuanyuan Clan, they would train in a different Godly Way. The various beings in the universe could never understand why and never would, as the Xuanyuan Clan had always regarded their Godly Ways as the greatest secrets of the clan and would never reveal them to the outside world.</p>

  <p>Originally, many people had wanted to force Nathan to make a move and see what kind of Godly Way he cultivated.</p>

  <p>But as his palm print came down, although it obviously contained the power of the great way, they could only tell it was the simplest life vitality palm print; it was truly impossible to distinguish his Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The big palm print covered the sky above the ogre martial artist and slammed into him.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Nathan had already returned to his own stone. It seemed as if he did not care about the result, but the truth was, he was just that confident that the ogre ace talent would not be able to dodge his palm print.</p>

  <p>He had instantly killed an ace talent like it was child's play.</p>

  <p>This was the strength of a Godly Genius. This was Nathan's strength.</p>

  <p>This scene stunned the other ogre warriors.</p>

  <p>Many ogre martial artists were also gathered in the outside world, watching this scene through the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>When they saw their ace talent provoke and defeat the human warriors again and again, they felt satisfied in their hearts.</p>

  <p>The world of chaos was often accompanied by the rise and fall of great races.</p>

  <p>The chaotic battle was not only a battle for the position of the leader of the universe, but also for the rise and fortune of an entire race and clan.</p>

  <p>If an ogre ace talent emerged as the champion in the Illusion Battlefield, he would most likely be able to reverse the fate decided by the heavens and lead the ogres to a flourishing future!</p>

  <p>The ogre warriors were violent and bloodthirsty, and at the same time, they held pride and glory in the highest regard, so they would never be willing to be inferior to others.</p>

  <p>After being suppressed by the humans all these years, the entire ogre race was filled with severe hostility. If they had the opportunity to turn the situation around, they would definitely counterattack. So now, they all had their eyes glued to the Illusion Space as their ace talent faced off against yet another human warrior, and they were eager to see him emerge victorious once again.</p>

  <p>However, the casual palm print from Nathan left them all completely stunned.</p>

  <p>Norvin, the ogre ace talent that Nathan was battling against, was the third-ranked ogre ace talent. Yet, in Nathan's eyes, he seemed to be only worth this ordinary slap.</p>

  <p>The gap in their strengths was too wide for the audience watching to accept.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng, who was standing on a black stone, was surprised, and his eyes flickered slightly.</p>

  <p>'This is the power of a Godly Genius!' he sighed in his heart.</p>

  <p>He had to admit that even he couldn't do what Nathan had just done.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng used his full strength, he might be able to kill the ogre ace talent with a single slap.</p>

  <p>However, it would be impossible for him to be so relaxed while doing it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Nathan's posture had been so relaxed that it seemed that his palm print was nothing but a casual gesture.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Luo Zheng was clear that it would have been impossible for Nathan to defeat the ogre ace talent that easily with strength alone. Even if there was a huge gap between them, their strengths didn't vary to that extent.</p>

  <p>The key was still in the Mu Ning of the great way contained in the palm print.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng looked over, he could feel an indescribable Mu Ning emitting from it. However, he was unable to determine what kind of Godly Way it was.</p>

  <p>Soon, the next round of battle began.</p>

  <p>Stones fell one by one once again.</p>

  <p>However, many of the discussions of the warriors in the outside world were still focused on Nathan. There were even many who concluded that there was no need to continue with the battle in the Illusion Battlefield as Nathan was definitely the victor.</p>

  <p>No one would have thought that after another three rounds, the ogre warrior called Norvin would be selected to fight again.</p>

  <p>Among the 300 warriors in the arena, most of them hadn't fought a single battle.</p>

  <p>For example, Luo Zheng, Lucille, and Lawson hadn't fought at all.</p>

  <p>But this ogre ace talent called Norvin had been selected for the third time!</p>

  <p>No one knew the mysterious girl's selection method. Perhaps she had her own motives for arranging the battles this way.</p>

  <p>When the ogre warrior had been suppressed by Nathan's big palm print, his heart had been filled with fear, but more than that, he'd seen it as a great humiliation.</p>

  <p>He had known that he would definitely lose to Nathan, but he had never thought that he would not be able to withstand even a single blow from him.</p>

  <p>The ogre martial artists regarded defeat as the greatest humiliation. So now that Norvin had been called to fight again, he was eager to wash away this shame.</p>

  <p>This time, a beautiful hand in the sky placed him down on the board, and then once again picked another human warrior.</p>

  <p>This human warrior wielded a dark-colored sword. It was the ace talent who had died once before because of Luo Zheng� Lone, the Otherworldly Swordsman.</p>

  <p>"This time, my opponent is finally somewhat normal!" A dark and cold expression appeared on Norvin's face. He was no match for Nathan, but he was not afraid of ordinary human ace talents.</p>

  <p>Lone had only earned fame recently, and that too only within the Thoughtless Minds. Other races and forces were not familiar with him, not to mention that he had lost five million Illusion Points because of Luo Zheng. And with his own twelve million Illusion Points, his ranking was not high at the first stage.</p>

  <p>As a result, he was inconspicuous.</p>

  <p>Only those who were from the Thoughtless Minds knew...</p>

  <p>Although Lone was an ace talent now, he definitely had the terrifying power to fight a Godly Genius himself!</p>

  <p>A cold smile appeared on Norvin's face. He wanted to return the humiliation he had suffered to this ace talent in front of him.</p>

  <p>As the two stones were relatively close to each other this time around, Norvin was the first to make a move when Lone was just placed down on the board.</p>

  <p>He immediately struck with his strongest move.</p>

  <p>"Immeasurable dark power!"</p>

  <p>The supreme divine weapon in his hands was a giant drum, and within the drum was a heart, a powerful heart that had been beating for tens of thousands of years.</p>

  <p>However, just as he revealed his strength, Lone expressionlessly slashed out.</p>

  <p>This sword strike was similar to Nathan's palm print, in that it was just as simple and just as unstoppable.</p>

  <p>When Norvin saw the incoming attack and felt the hidden might within it, he couldn't help but curse in a low voice, "Damn it!"</p>
