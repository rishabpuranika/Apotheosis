  <p>
</p>

  <p>Maha was previously lying on his chair. However, he immediately jumped upon hearing that so many warriors accepted the challenge.</p>

  <p>Two beautiful female servants walked out from behind his chair and draped a large, silver cloak over him. Maha gave the Supreme Lords a cold smile. "I'll be going to the Sunflower Water World soon. Everyone, please prepare well."</p>

  <p>This was an extremely advantageous outcome for the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Since the world lords of the Evolutionary Universe dared to accept the challenge then Maha would do his best to eliminate all of them.</p>

  <p>He also did not fear any of the Supreme Lords. The Sacred race was not afraid of all-out war!</p>

  <p>There was also an underlying scheme Maha was brewing by going to the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>Killing all the powerful warriors also meant destroying the morale of the entire universe, thus, suppressing its momentum.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe making their move was exactly what the Sacred race wanted to see.</p>

  <p>Many of the world lords quickly mobilized towards the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Xenia and Karl, both Godly Geniuses, also made their return.</p>

  <p>Nathan and Lucille were rescued by the Humanity Alliance after falling into the Fiery Rock World and returned to the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Healum was able to calculate their position. He displayed the Space Lock to connect to Yolande whom he then projected into the Fiery Rock World. She created quite a ruckus that enabled Supreme Lord Healum to take the two Godly Geniuses away before the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race arrived.</p>

  <p>The ability to deduce directions by means of the heavens was an extremely useful advantage to the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe. This was a consequence the Sacred race had to come to terms with by battling in the enemy territory.</p>

  <p>Several days later, the Supreme Lords of the three great human forces gathered on top of Breaking Cloud Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords were all wise and naturally understood Maha's motives. They gathered here first to try to figure out how to deal with this situation.</p>

  <p>Understandably, the atmosphere around them was extremely heavy.</p>

  <p>"It's not the right time... Maha has given us quite a difficult problem."</p>

  <p>Master Feng, the head of the Celestial Position race, sat on the seat of honor but there was an evident trace of fatigue on his face.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle stood in front of Master Feng. She wore a cyan long dress today that perfectly emphasized her perfect figure. She too wore a look of helplessness on her face. "If the decisive battle starts earlier, what would be our chances of winning?"</p>

  <p>The eyes of Supreme Lord of Original Sin and Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment flickered as they looked at Master Feng.</p>

  <p>There was a bit of hesitation before he answered. "Twenty percent... Our chance at victory is too small."</p>

  <p>However, these Supreme Lords had many tricks up their sleeves.</p>

  <p>The Gods Killing Sword Array the Celestial Position had designed and created, for one, simply waited for Margaret to control once she returned.</p>

  <p>The Thoughtless Minds also had the Star Destroying Array.</p>

  <p>The Blessed Buddha Land also had the Grand Buddha Pagoda.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle also cultivated the Self-destruction Technique.</p>

  <p>What was more, Master Feng had the Evolution Lotus Flower that could grant him extreme strength for a short period of time. Such strength could qualify him to injure or even kill a True God!</p>

  <p>The Evolutionary Universe's foundation was also quite strong.</p>

  <p>Mike had already predicted all this and invested everything he had in this grand era.</p>

  <p>However, despite all these trump cards, their chances of winning remained slim.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A ray of light shot out from the sky.</p>

  <p>That ray of light was a warrior who stopped just a hundred miles away from the Breaking Cloud Mountain because it was at this point that an invisible light curtain blocked his way.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Mirage's eyes froze for a moment before he waved his hand and opened a small hole on the curtain, allowing the warrior to enter.</p>

  <p>The warrior was none other than Zheng who had been summoned to this gathering by the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>Zheng quickly landed on the summit and bowed to the Supreme Lords, greeting them with great respect.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Oracle smiled. "Zheng, it's been three years. I heard your strength has greatly increased."</p>

  <p>They had already been informed of Zheng's performance by Master Feng.</p>

  <p>This piece of news was probably the only consolation they had been given after things had become dire.</p>

  <p>It was natural for them to hope for Zheng's growth. They all counted on him to slaughter all Sacred warriors that had infiltrated their universe.</p>

  <p>However, despite Zheng's growth being worthy of admiration, it was still not enough.</p>

  <p>"You flatter me," he said.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin simply glanced at him. "There's no need for modesty Zheng. I want to hear your opinion regarding Maha's challenge."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows rose at his straightforwardness but he simply gave an equally straightforward answer. "Ignore him!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Supreme Lord of Original Sin asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>A smile appeared on Zheng's face. "Since Maha is willing to waste his time in the Sunflower Water World, then let him. We can do something else!"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Supreme Lord of Original Sin asked again, clearly intrigued by Zheng's answer.</p>

  <p>They had all been focused onto the Sacred race that they didn't have the time to think of other matters.</p>

  <p>"Let's suppress the Demon Night first!" Zheng declared in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>His words earned him a lot of curious looks from the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night couldn't be underestimated but given their position of being held back by the ogre race, they didn't think that the race really could contribute much impact to the current situation.</p>

  <p>However, since it was Zheng who mentioned it, then there was probably some logic to it.</p>

  <p>"Since Maha wanted to fight in the Sunflower Water World, then there must be Supreme Lords lurking around. Their goal is to force all of us to accept their challenge. We can take advantage of this opportunity to deal with the Demon Night and free the ogres from the battle."</p>

  <p>A faint smile crossed Supreme Lord of Original Sin's features. "That is not a good idea. We don't need to fear the Demon Night. You don't seem to know what Master Feng's Heavenly Destiny is."</p>

  <p>"He's told me," Zheng flatly replied.</p>

  <p>"Then since you've heard about it, you should know that if this momentum is taken away, we will lose something we greatly rely on,"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord of Original Sin shot back.</p>

  <p>Determination flashed in Zheng's eyes. "Even if this momentum is seized, I will help Master Feng take it back!"</p>

  <p>"How?" Supreme Lord of Oracle asked.</p>

  <p>"If Maha kills our warriors in Sunflower Water World, what would the result be?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"The morale and the momentum would be greatly reduced," Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment answered.</p>

  <p>"All Supreme Lords are almighty. During the battle, the side that burns with righteous indignation is bound to win! Even if Maha suppresses the morale of the universe, it will still be useless because as long as there is hope, then our morale will rise again!"</p>

  <p>Zheng paused before continuing. "Let me bring our warriors hope. I will kill Maha!"</p>

  <p>"This strategy..." Supreme Lord of Original Sin hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>Zheng's idea was a bit risky after all.</p>

  <p>"This is practically a desperate choice." Supreme Lord of Oracle sighed lightly.</p>

  <p>They would first let the Sacred race suppress all living creatures in this universe. In this oppressive environment, the warriors would turn into rebels armed with indignation and desperate courage. It was resistance against the set order of violence and oppression that fueled a warrior's determination!</p>

  <p>When that happened, all of the trillion creatures would fight for their lives. Once the momentum rebounded, then it would yield a terrifying result.</p>

  <p>However, if they did commence with this plan, they might have to sacrifice a few world lords who would go against Maha in the Sunflower Water World.</p>

  <p>"Can anyone propose a better choice?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords all stayed silent.</p>

  <p>It seemed there was no other choice.</p>

  <p>Procrastination was only equal to suicide in their case.</p>

  <p>"According to Zheng's idea, if we take the risk, we can increase the chances of winning by ten percent," Master Feng declared.</p>

  <p>The worry was still evident in the Supreme Lords' faces, but this plan was their only choice. They could only hope that this was also the right one.</p>

  <p>One could either rely on their strength when faced against a powerful opponent or choose to be cunning and take advantage of the situation to win.</p>

  <p>"If all of you accept my suggestion, then we will have to move fast.</p>

  <p>Before the Sacred race can make their move, we must defeat the Demon Night!" Zheng declared with conviction.</p>
