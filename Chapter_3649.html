<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the battle raged, many Taiyi Guards and Taiyi Generals in the twelve passes could only watch in awe.</p>

  <p>They wouldn't dare get caught in a battle of this level.</p>

  <p>But they were snapped out of their stupor when the ink blobs appeared.</p>

  <p>Their blood ran cold at the sight.</p>

  <p>"Activate the array!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone, withdraw and head to the pass!"</p>

  <p>"We can't fight that thing!"</p>

  <p>Countless Taiyi Guards and warriors of the Other Shore Realm stampeded into the passes.</p>

  <p>Every time a world descended, the rules were changed.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, no other world had been unleashed but those by the leader of the Bright Mountain and by Springer.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! dozens of ink blobs appeared above the Heavenly Wind Pass, floating in the air. As one, they rushed downward, wrapping themselves around the five-star Taiyi Guards before they could enter the protective array.</p>

  <p>As soon as the ink touched them, the Taiyi Guards' skin turned black and started to crack like charcoal. They became another manner of creature altogether. Now hollow-eyed monsters, they turned around and wildly pounced on their former colleagues.</p>

  <p>"Woo...woo..." one of the black monsters howled as it scrambled toward the Evil God.</p>

  <p>When the black monster was about two dozen feet away, light flashed in the Evil God's hand. He tossed a diamond-shaped token formed by the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The diamond-shaped token exploded on the black monster's head, smashing it into pieces.</p>

  <p>The Evil God snorted, "You asked for it."</p>

  <p>Nothing could have survived that blast.</p>

  <p>However, the black monster somehow began to get up again, its head having reformed.</p>

  <p>"A monster created in this world becomes immortal in this world, huh?" the Evil God murmured to himself, thinking aloud.</p>

  <p>The blast drew the attention of more black monsters. They all began heading toward the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God glanced at the Heavenly Wind Pass not far away. He deliberated if he had enough time to make it there.</p>

  <p>Deciding he did, he was taken aback when he turned in that direction.</p>

  <p>It had taken him only a second to decide, but the path was now cut off by a large number of black monsters, swarming toward him. The Evil God had no choice but to run. But an idea was starting to form in his mind.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Generals who were able to make it to the Heavenly Wind Pass observed the situation from afar.</p>

  <p>"It seems the Taiyi General called the Evil God can't make it, after all."</p>

  <p>"Should we help him?"</p>

  <p>"No. Leave him alone."</p>

  <p>The Evil God had displayed his powerful strength at the Heavenly Wind Pass, but he was still generally disliked. The Taiyi Generals had fought on the battlefields for many years but somehow feared the Evil God, so they were hesitant to come to his rescue.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God, at this moment, had other things in mind. As an Inner-world Generating Avatar, the Evil God couldn't even think of opposing Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But he could distance himself from Luo Zheng using these black monsters and the chaos of battle as an excuse.</p>

  <p>Thus far, Luo Zheng had showed he could freely control the Evil God. If he so wanted, he could freeze the Evil God on the spot, making him unable to move. However, the Evil God was convinced there must be a limit to that control. There must be some range beyond which the controller would no longer be able to reach the Inner-world Generating Avatar.</p>

  <p>The Evil God now saw a chance to test that theory.</p>

  <p>"Wha...wha..."</p>

  <p>The black monsters chased after the Evil God as fast as they could. The Evil God was as light as a swallow as he sped onward, flying close to the ground.</p>

  <p>After reaching certain distances, he would draw some Jun of force from the Civilization Artifact of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization in Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>He could only do this as an Inner-world Generating Avatar under Luo Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>The Evil God theorized that once he was no longer able to extract the force, then it must follow that he was out of Luo Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng was crouching down on the back of a Corpse Spirit Sun Crow, taking a break. Controlling so many Corpse Spirit Jin Wu was not an easy task.</p>

  <p>After fighting with Phoenix for a while, Luo Zheng decided to return control of the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu to Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>The creatures seemed more agile in his hands, anyway.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>Phoenix suddenly lobbed a ball of blazing flame at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The flame was so strong that even Qiu Yinhe might not have been able to survive it. But surrounded by Corpse Spirit Jin Wu, the flame didn't reach Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>In Phoenix's anger, it seemed she forgot Luo Zheng was unaffected by the flames.</p>

  <p>At this moment, something caught Luo Zheng's attention in his mind.</p>

  <p>It was the Evil God, running eastward at full speed.</p>

  <p>In a flash, he entered the Evil God's mind.</p>

  <p>Through the Evil God's eyes, he saw the dozens of twisted black monsters chasing after him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng figured these black monsters probably appeared from a summoned world.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng read the Evil God's memories. He discovered that the Evil God had been drawing some Jun of force from his inner world as he was being chased. This struck Luo Zheng as somewhat strange.</p>

  <p>"Stop running. Kill those black monsters and come back to me."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's orders took over the Evil God's mind.</p>

  <p>The Evil God stiffened on the spot. He gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p>This had been his only chance to escape!</p>

  <p>But he wasn't able to disobey Luo Zheng at all.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Evil God stretched out his hand and flung diamond-shaped tokens at the monsters.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Each token exploded on a black monster's head.</p>

  <p>However, these creatures were indeed immortal. After exploding into pieces, they simply reconstructed and came back to life.</p>

  <p>To make matters worse, every time they recovered, the black monsters only seemed to grow in size and strength.</p>

  <p>The Evil God squinted at them.</p>

  <p>He had another idea brewing.</p>

  <p>He flipped his body in the air, flinging diamond-shaped tokens again and again at the black monsters.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The black monsters exploded again and again, continuing to reform and reanimate. With each recovery, they became more and more powerful.</p>

  <p>Springer, who was watching events unfold from the core zone, began to get puzzled.</p>

  <p>These monsters came from the world he unleashed, which was called the Fickle World, so they were called Fickle Demons. He knew they were immortal, and that they grew stronger with every reanimation.</p>

  <p>It could go on endlessly.</p>

  <p>Most opponents would stop attacking the Fickle Demons as soon as they discovered this.</p>

  <p>But now, here was someone who still kept attacking despite clearly seeing this only made the Fickle Demons more powerful.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to Springer, the Evil God was doing this intentionally.</p>

  <p>Outwardly, he was only following Luo Zheng's order to kill the monsters, after all.</p>

  <p>But once the situation reached a tipping point, he would make his escape.</p>
