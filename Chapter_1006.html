<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Many of the disciples of Cloud Hall amused themselves by discussing the matter. Most of them were green with envy. As they all walked past Mu Ning, they stole glances at her.</p>

  <p>"Zheng's the lucky guy, isn't he? In just a span of two years, his cultivation has advanced unbelievably. He even brought back such a pretty woman who's so fond of him!"</p>

  <p>"Stop complaining! If you were as brilliant as Luo Zheng, you'd have successfully set up a sect-protecting array like this by now. Then, you'd have your own lady to love you, too!"</p>

  <p>"Have you heard of the rumors? I heard that Luo Zheng and our sect leader also had a romantic past!"</p>

  <p>"Keep dreaming! Do you think a proud woman like our sect leader will take a fancy to a man like Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"Come on! My source is pretty reliable compared to yours after all. This is something that an elder has personally confirmed. Things have been stiff between them lately though. It is said that it's because of Mu Ning."</p>

  <p>News had spread out through different channels. For the well-informed warriors, such information wasn't so difficult to obtain. If the rumors were indeed true, what could Luo Zheng do to pacify two women on his own?</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng pushed the door open and made his way out of the cultivation room, his eyes swept across the crowd and then fell on Mu Ning, who was standing nearby, smiling at him.</p>

  <p>Unlike Luo Zheng, Mu Ning wasn't known to be a cultivator that broke a sweat that much. She mostly relied on pills and various resources in reaching the Internal Elixir Realm. She didn't really spend much time on cultivation. The life she lived was rather sophisticated.</p>

  <p>It was natural for warriors to dedicate all of their time on cultivation, for none of them wanted to fall behind. Even female warriors made sure of it. However, Mu Ning was an exception. She valued her life more than cultivation.</p>

  <p>After she had settled down in the Cloud Hall, she made it a habit to appear in front of Luo Zheng in different kinds of clothing. Even an ordinary dress looked exquisite on her. Her beauty had that kind of power.</p>

  <p>Perfection is imaginary. Just like others, Mu Ning had her own set of flaws. Putting aside her somehow revolting personality, one could regard her as a perfect woman. That was one of the many reasons why many disciples of the Cloud Hall envied Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You're here," Mu Ning smiled.</p>

  <p>"Didn't I tell you there was no need to wait here?"</p>

  <p>It had been three days since Luo Zheng entered the cultivation room and Mu Ning had waited just as long.</p>

  <p>"I promise to take note of that," Mu Ning nodded meekly.</p>

  <p>Obviously, she only said that to avoid upsetting Luo Zheng. It was clear how she was going to keep on doing that. Luo Zheng knew it, too. This woman's persistence was carved into her bones. But her change in attitude was notable, especially whenever Luo Zheng was around.</p>

  <p>Holding a basket of delicious food in one hand, Mu Ning held Zheng's hand with the other. They walked through a corridor and when they reached the dining area, she carefully placed out all the goodies she had in the basket, all of which were steaming hot and delicate-looking.</p>

  <p>It was indeed rare for Luo Zheng to live like that. After having his meal, he inquired about the situation in the Central Region. When he had already gathered some of the necessary information, he returned to his cultivation room and began his endless cultivation. During that period of time, he had a feeling that he was soon to break through to the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>If he succeeded, then his chances of fighting against Eddie were higher.</p>

  <p>It was his utmost priority to find an opportunity to fight against Eddie.</p>

  <p>The reason why he came out of the training room for a break was to check if something had occurred that could bring him closer to Eddie.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Luo Zheng who was always busy, Ning Yudie had also dedicated her time into cultivation.</p>

  <p>Even though there was a mountain of information within the Cloud Hall that had been passed on by Saint Morphens, she had thrown it all to the side. It was as if she wasn't too interested in understanding what was going on in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>As a sect leader, that kind of action was undoubtedly irresponsible.</p>

  <p>After the Heavenly Evil Sect wiped out the Ethereal Spirit Sect, their power was stronger than ever. Even the independent warriors who had joined the other large sects had all started to join the Heavenly Evil Sect.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for those independent warriors to have a sense of belonging to these sects. They submitted themselves to whoever gave them benefits, and whoever was strong. The Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom had both qualities.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom even managed to defeat the number one sect in the entire Central Region. Which sect could still block the footsteps of the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom?</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom was slowly expanding to the center of the Central Region, swallowing up all of the mediocre second-grade and third-grade sects. How could the other less powerful sects resist? Almost without wasting a single soldier, the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom successfully won over the other sects.</p>

  <p>They all announced their attachment to the divine kingdom and became its vassal force.</p>

  <p>As the situation became more and more critical, the pressure on the elders of the Cloud Hall became as intense. However, as the sect leader, Ning Yudie was completely unaware. She didn't even leave her own Ice Palace.</p>

  <p>"We can't let our leader go on like this. The Oracle City has already sent countless people over, but they can't even meet her."</p>

  <p>"Right now, only the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance can fight against the Heavenly Evil Sect, but our leader has no reaction.</p>

  <p>What should we do?"</p>

  <p>"Alas! Although our leader has outstanding strength, she is currently troubled by personal feelings. This is really troublesome. Morphens, how about you go and persuade her?"</p>
