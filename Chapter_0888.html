<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 888 The Game Of War (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Xun, as the queen of the Demon Night, exuded an air of superiority in front of anyone!</p>

  <p>Even the war sages, or the Soul Sea Realm masters would have felt that they were a cut below her, if they were to face her powerful aura, not to even mention the top-level war lords in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>However, when only Zheng was with her, she would drop her airs and become much more casual in her manner.</p>

  <p>For example, over the past few days while Zheng had been cultivating in the practice room, she would come forth from his body and walk around. She would even nag about certain things around Zheng…</p>

  <p>She was greatly different from how she had been before. This kind of contrast surprised Zheng tremendously. Occasionally, she would even mutter a few curses, leaving him even more speechless.</p>

  <p>At hearing Zheng's ultimatum and seeing him summon his sword spirit, Maurice's face had darkened completely.</p>

  <p>Maurice wasn't an idiot. How could he forget the existence of the prominent Heavenly Feather Sacred Place on this continent?</p>

  <p>However, would the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place truly stand up and aid the Purple Heart Sacred Place because of this so-called 'queen'? Maurice could not help feeling doubtful about this.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the top-level war lords of the Demon Night did have a great respect for their 'queen'. However, if a war really broke out among the many grand sacred places, he assumed that the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place would not necessary desire to become involved.</p>

  <p>If Maurice had traveled with Zheng on his last visit to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, he would have known that the Demon Night's great loyalty to their queen was indeed true.</p>

  <p>To the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, Xun was like a spiritual totem.</p>

  <p>Even if she were to order the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place to attack the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place, Amber would not dare to disobey. If Xun only asked the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place to lend a little help to the Purple Heart Sacred Place, it would be a small matter by comparison.</p>

  <p>Xun didn't say anything, but Esther understood what was on Zheng's mind. Esther stood up and said, "If my queen gives the order, the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place will definitely commit, through thick and thin!"</p>

  <p>Esther was the spokesperson of the Demon Night in the Tower of Sin, and what she said would also represent Amber's opinion.</p>

  <p>"You will do as Zheng says," Xun said with a wink.</p>

  <p>Xun wanted to take revenge. Therefore she had pinned all of her hopes for achieving her goals on Zheng. So she would surely do her best to help him.</p>

  <p>Maurice was brooding over the credibility of the Demon Night's words. It was true that the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was indeed powerful, but if it had to face both the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place in combat, then all of the parties involved would have to pay a considerable price.</p>

  <p>Weighing up the whole situation and making a decision was a painful process for Maurice now. His decision would affect the fate of the entirety of the ogre race.</p>

  <p>Zheng still waited patiently for his reply with a faint smile hovering on his face. After a while, he said, "That's why I have given you a month's time to consider!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Maurice asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. The ogres were not very intelligent, probably only a little smarter than the orcs and giants. "In this one month, you can try to flatten the Purple Heart Sacred Place! You can test the reaction of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place…"</p>

  <p>Maurice frowned. Then he finally understood why Zheng had given them a month.</p>

  <p>During this one month, the ogres didn't need to leave the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Then the game within the Tower of Sin would shift to the many outlying grand sacred places outside the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>If the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place were to win, they could indeed use the Purple Heart Sacred Place to threaten Zheng. If the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place were to lose, or they didn't dare to make a move against the Purple Heart Sacred Place due to pressure from the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, then at that time, Maurice and the other ogres would have no choice but to leave the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Maurice's eyes suddenly began to shine with a brilliant light, as if he had realized something!</p>

  <p>Leaving the Tower of Sin would bring no harm to Maurice personally. He was already a top-level war lord, and sooner or later, he would have to leave the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>But if the worst case scenario happened and he was forced to leave the Tower of Sin after the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place lost the war, then he would have to shoulder a great deal of responsibility for the loss. He would then also have to face severe punishment upon returning to the ogres' sacred place.</p>

  <p>However, what Zheng had suggested about the one-month grace period meant that Maurice didn't have to take much responsibility for what would happen.</p>

  <p>After all, if the decision were shifted and became the responsibility of the two sacred places, it was no longer Maurice who would have to decide whether or not the ogres could stay in the Tower of Sin, but rather the powerful Soul Sea Realm masters in the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place and the Dread Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Maurice was much relieved.</p>

  <p>"Oh, now I understand it." He then stood up and ordered the ogres beside him, "Remove Bradley's corpse immediately. Today's negotiations will end here!"</p>

  <p>Maurice then prepared to leave the hall. But after taking a few steps, he turned his head to Zheng and gruffly said, "Thank you."</p>

  <p>Many warriors in the hall felt it strange that Maurice would say thanks to Zheng. Only the few intelligent ones, like Xun and Esther, got it, while all the others were all dumb struck.</p>

  <p>Zheng had killed Maurice's comrade and just forced him to possibly take all of the ogres out of the Tower of Sin. So why would Maurice have felt grateful to Zheng after all this?</p>
