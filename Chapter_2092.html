  <p>
</p>

  <p>"It really is the Soul-eater Summoning Method!"</p>

  <p>"Anyone who uses this evil magic will never be reincarnated. They'll be tormented for all eternity!"</p>

  <p>"Murphy's crazy for teaching his disciple that horrid magic!"</p>

  <p>The Soul-eater Summoning Method was a dark and pernicious martial art.</p>

  <p>This magic allowed a warrior to summon a Soul-eater at the price of their soul.</p>

  <p>It was an irreversible contract that subjected a person's soul to eternal torment.</p>

  <p>As its name implied, Soul-eaters devoured and inflicted pain on the summoner's soul in order to gain energy. The more pain inflicted, the more power the Soul-eater got.</p>

  <p>In the past divine eras, when the True Gods realized the danger and consequences that came with the Soul-eater Summoning Method, they had forbidden the practice and spread of the art in the whole divine land.</p>

  <p>And as time passed, the number of True Gods that knew about the Soul-eater Summoning Method became less and less.</p>

  <p>No Holy Being ever imagined that Murphy would pass on the Soul-eater Summoning Method to his disciple.</p>

  <p>As soon as the golden threads had completely devoured Mateo, a Soul-eater had immediately formed. Its body morphed into weird shapes until it grew a potbelly and a double chin. With a fiendish aura and a heavy black mist shrouding its body, it resembled a fat evil Buddha.</p>

  <p>And as if that wasn't creepy enough, its face was scarily similar to Mateo's. "So painful..."</p>

  <p>It groaned brokenly, voice as rough as sandpaper. Mateo's soul was fully absorbed by the Soul-eater.</p>

  <p>Its beady black eyes stared at Blayd intently for a few seconds before it suddenly twisted its enormous body and pounced at Blayd.</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>Blayd dodged just in time. As he jumped backward to avoid the attack, he had managed to throw a punch at the space in front of him, destroying the area and releasing a strong counterforce that accelerated his retreat.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Soul-eater was even faster. Seeing Blayd move to a distance, the Soul-eater flash-stepped and instantly caught up with him.</p>

  <p>Like two giant mallets, its two hands slammed down on Blayd!</p>

  <p>Blayd's eyes flashed with fierce determination. His torrential fighting intent ignited and boiled to the surface, engulfing his body in blue flames.</p>

  <p>He had unleashed the 'momentum', his full fighting intent, from his inner world!</p>

  <p>At this moment, all living beings in his inner world had sensed the looming danger. The True God used his Godly Tile to suppress the heavens which forced all the living beings to pray. Every single one of them was emitting a fighting intent which flowed like countless small streams that slowly joined together to form rivers.</p>

  <p>They turned into a great river, which eventually turned into an ocean, fusing into Blayd's Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>This fighting intent was the same as the Faith Energy that Xun possessed. True Gods relied on the Faith Energy from the living beings in their inner worlds in order to unleash their strongest, most fearsome powers.</p>

  <p>Once they became Holy Beings, however, they'd be able to cover the heavens of their inner worlds with Heaven-suppressing Objects, ridding them of their dependence on Faith Energy. In other words, they could directly borrow the power of the universe without the worship of living beings.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Within Blayd's inner world, his azure Godly Tile trembled violently as a strange power gushed out from his elixir field!</p>

  <p>"Grand Fighting Technique!"</p>

  <p>With a shout, Blayd extended his hands above his head, and a blue turtle shell materialized in his right hand and a short halberd in his left.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Blayd used the turtle shell to block the Soul-eater's incoming attack as he aimed at the Soul-eater with the halberd.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The impact caused an explosion in the sky and an invisible shockwave to spread out, reducing everything it hit into dust. Everything within a ten-million-mile radius was blown to bits.</p>

  <p>The force was so strong that even the Supreme Lords who were far away from the fight had felt a great pressure.</p>

  <p>In an effort to protect Zheng and the rest, Supreme Lord of Original Sin joined hands with Master Feng to create a protective barrier around the lot.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of the Sacred race also did the same for their weaker members, and save for these two great lands, the entirety of the Dream Sound World was annihilated.</p>

  <p>"So, this is a True God's real power?"</p>

  <p>Zheng muttered. As he watched the fight, he couldn't help but worry about the progress of Margaret's revival.</p>

  <p>A sigh escaped his lips. This shockwave alone was enough to shatter four supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>At his current stage, Zheng's physical strength was far more than Blayd's.</p>

  <p>However, he also knew that even with all the power of the Nine Divine Stars, he still wouldn't be able to achieve such a grand-scale result.</p>

  <p>Pak!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A crack appeared on Blayd's turtle shell shield and quickly spread all over its surface. A second later, it shattered to pieces, and his halberd snapped in half.</p>

  <p>Blayd breathed heavily. The halberd had managed to pierce through the Soul-eater's hand, causing dark mist to seep from the wound. The Soul-eater groaned in pain.</p>

  <p>"Hurts... so much..."</p>

  <p>Irritated by the pain, the Soul-eater's body expanded once more.</p>

  <p>Its golden skin shone brighter and brighter and its vicious aura increased until it was almost palpable.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With a giant hand, it slapped Blayd hard.</p>

  <p>BANG!</p>

  <p>The attack had been so quick and sudden that Blayed had no time to dodge. The impact of the Soul-eater's hand on Blayd's body caused another shockwave. and sent Blayd flying backwards, through a supreme world, and into the Lower World, disappearing from everyone's sights.</p>

  <p>"Ughh..."</p>

  <p>Having lost its opponent, the Soul-eater turned its big head and looked to where Zheng was standing.</p>

  <p>Even with his soul devoured and unconscious, Mateo's hatred was alive and burning. His eyes gleamed with malice. There was no one he hated more than Zheng.</p>

  <p>He had put in blood, sweat, and tears to kill Wynn. But just when he was about to help his master win the universal war, Zheng and Blayd had to appear and ruin everything, leaving him no choice but to use the Soul-eater Summoning Method. Now he had to endure an eternity of pain!</p>

  <p>With his present visual acuity, Zheng was unable to see beyond several supreme worlds. However, he knew from Blayd's weakening fighting intent that he had already lost the fight. Meanwhile, the Soul-eater's gaze had caused a cold sinister feeling to wash over him.</p>

  <p>This was bad. Seeing that things weren't going in their favor, Master Feng summoned the Evolution Lotus Flower. They weren't just going to sit and wait for death. They'd do whatever was necessary in order to stay alive.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Sacred Supreme Lords wore proud smiles. They never imagined Mateo had it in him to turn the situation around to their favor.</p>

  <p>They could only imagine the lengths Mateo had to go through in order to give them their victory.</p>
