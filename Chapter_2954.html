  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng tried his best to avoid the villages when he transferred the forces.</p>

  <p>However, continuing on like this was not a solution.</p>

  <p>He could only hope that after Emily, Timotheus, and the others fled this place, he could quickly find a way to leave as well.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that he would encounter such a strange thing in this space?</p>

  <p>Just as he retreated towards the exit, Emily and the others unexpectedly came back.</p>

  <p>"Why did you come back?" Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Emily shook her head. "We couldn't find the exit!"</p>

  <p>After they went back following the path they took when they came in, they found that the space crack had completely disappeared.</p>

  <p>Even though Emily used the Truth of Void Destruction, it still could not open up a space channel that led to the outside world.</p>

  <p>Timotheus and Ramzi had also tried their best to find an exit, but they still could not find one. In the end, they had no choice but to turn back.</p>

  <p>"This is going to be troublesome," Zheng said with a bitter smile. "I'm not afraid of the Wooden Puppet Soldiers' attacks. But if I let them unleash their power, pandemonium will break loose in the entire divine land."</p>

  <p>Emily gazed at these Wooden Puppet Soldiers and said, "These puppets can't attack endlessly. Their bodies will eventually run out of energy, right?"</p>

  <p>"It would be true if we were in another place. This place, however, is practically covered in divine crystals," Ramzi said with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, one of the Wooden Puppet Soldiers that attacked Zheng at the very beginning suddenly stretched out one foot. With a light kick, it gouged out one of the divine crystals on the ground, picked it up, and then stuffed it into its chest.</p>

  <p>"Then we should find a way to break these Wooden Puppet Soldiers," said Emily.</p>

  <p>"That's the only way." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, these Wooden Puppet Soldiers were not smart enough. They would only instinctively eliminate the enemies in front of them and then move on to the next target.</p>

  <p>As long as Zheng acted as a bait and attracted their attacks, Emily and others could easily destroy them.</p>

  <p>Worried that Zheng could not handle the Wooden Puppet Soldiers on his own, Emily and the others separated into two groups and went around the Wooden Puppet Soldiers from Zheng's two sides, ready to attack them from the back. At this moment, Zheng also drew out the Soaring Snake Sword from his space ring.</p>

  <p>At this moment, however, the Wooden Puppet Soldiers' red eyes suddenly dimmed and emitted white light. In the next second, they stopped attacking altogether.</p>

  <p>Emily, Timotheus, Leopold, and Ramzi stood still, utterly baffled by what was happening.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?" Emily looked at Zheng in surprise.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who also had a baffled look on his face, shook his head. Those hostile Wooden Puppet Soldiers then began to turn back. The attack just now felt like it was just a fragment of their imagination.</p>

  <p>Confused, Zheng put the Soaring Snake Sword back into his space ring.</p>

  <p>Right at that moment, the Wooden Puppet Soldiers' eyes turned red again, and they suddenly turned their heads in unison.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>As the runes on their chests spun, many light cones began to form.</p>

  <p>Since Emily and the others were close to the Wooden Puppet Soldiers, the soldiers naturally took them, these powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm, as their targets.</p>

  <p>Emily and the others turned as pale as death. Just as they were about to be smashed into pieces by the light cones, Zheng suddenly had an epiphany. He shook his right hand lightly, once again drawing the Soaring Snake Sword out of his space ring.</p>

  <p>As the red light in the eyes of the Wooden Puppet Soldiers dissipated, their offense came into a stop as well.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Emily heaved a long sigh of relief. Her face was still a little flushed, adding a different kind of charm to her beauty.</p>

  <p>She was scared half to death just now, but upon seeing Zheng's action, she naturally understood what was happening.</p>

  <p>"It seems the token used to enter this place is the Grand Chieftain's Soaring Snake Sword," said Timotheus who, after quite a long while, finally recovered from the fright that overwhelmed him.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the Soaring Snake Sword in his hand and smiled helplessly.</p>

  <p>"I should have pulled out this sword from the very beginning had I known this."</p>

  <p>After the Wooden Puppet Soldiers stopped their attacks, they returned to where they came from.</p>

  <p>Now that the group of warriors had averted the crisis, they became even more curious about the Wooden Puppet Soldiers.</p>

  <p>The Grand Chieftain must have made such an arrangement for a reason.</p>

  <p>According to their guess, the Wooden Puppet Soldiers must be here to protect something. Since the Soaring Snake Sword could protect them from being attacked by the Wooden Puppet Soldiers, they were naturally happy to forge ahead and investigate the matter.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, they had learned from their mistakes. They were afraid that there were other traps waiting for them in this strange place, so they did not dare to rush around. They could only follow behind the Wooden Puppet Soldiers and forge ahead slowly.</p>

  <p>Once the Wooden Puppet Soldiers passed through those mounds of divine crystals, everyone finally saw the small bridge hidden behind those mounds.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the bridge, Zheng found the huge array that Ramzi mentioned before.</p>

  <p>About two to three hundred array eyes were embedded in the array. The Wooden Puppet Soldiers lined up and entered the eyes of the array one after the other. The light in their eyes died out, and they stopped moving.</p>

  <p>What Ramzi said was reasonable. Although the Wooden Puppet Soldiers were powerful, their range of motion was limited. They could only protect this space.</p>

  <p>If the divine land was guarded by this group of Wooden Puppet Soldiers, they wouldn't have been brutally abused by those warriors at the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>After observing for a while, Zheng crossed the bridge, holding the Soaring Snake Sword in his hand. Emily and the others were not far behind. When he reached the end of the bridge, Zheng saw a lifelike Chiyou statue.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Without saying anything, Timotheus, Leopold, and Ramzi dropped on their knees and worshiped the Grand Chieftain's statue.</p>

  <p>This was the tradition of the Nine Li race. They would still have to adhere to it even in the bone tower, not to mention now that they were faced with a statue whose significance was on a whole different level.</p>

  <p>"This statue..."</p>

  <p>Zheng measured up the Chiyou statue.</p>

  <p>The Chiyou statues he had seen before had three heads and six hands. This statue, however, was a little strange. Five of its six hands held a weapon each.</p>

  <p>An ax, a spear, a halberd, a saber, and a crossbow? But the remaining hand held nothing.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the Soaring Snake Sword in his hand. Before the others knew it, he had put the sword in the statue's empty hand without any hesitation in the slightest.</p>

  <p>The moment the Soaring Snake Sword left Zheng's hand, light once again burst from the big array under the small bridge. Those Wooden Puppet Soldiers seemed just like they were roused from their sleep. One by one, their eyes glowed red, and they swarmed around Zheng and his companions from both sides of the small bridge.</p>

  <p>"This is bad!"</p>

  <p>"These Wooden Puppet Soldiers only acknowledge the Soaring Snake Sword!"</p>

  <p>Timotheus and the others were petrified.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned and tried to pull the Soaring Snake Sword out of the statue's hand.</p>

  <p>But no matter how hard he tried, the Soaring Snake Sword did not budge.</p>

  <p>There was a slight change in the expression on Zheng's face. He ran the strength source in his body and then tried to pull it out again. Although he tried his best, he still could not pull it out.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>He didn't expect this to happen either.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was at a loss for what to do, the Chiyou statue moved and lifted up the Soaring Snake Sword in its hand.</p>

  <p>The Soaring Snake Sword quivered, and the Wooden Puppet Soldiers suddenly seemed like they had received some kind of order. Their red eyes dimmed again, and each went back to their own position inside the array under the small bridge.</p>
