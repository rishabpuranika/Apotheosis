<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was known that despite having turned into ashes, things in the Dark Region could not exist in the light.</p>

  <p>The white light had eroded them, and as a result their ashes had completely dissipated.</p>

  <p>Almost everything was swept away, to the point that the area within a hundred-mile radius was practically spotless and abnormally clean.</p>

  <p>As for the creature from the Star Falcon race, Hans, he was now on the verge of death.</p>

  <p>He had burned his starry gem, while the Dark Region had eroded his whole body.</p>

  <p>"How... How did you make it?" he couldn't help but ask Zheng when they fell down together. Apparently, he thought that Zheng had created that beam of light.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked at the Star Falcon in front of him, who was at the last moments of his life. "Because we have a purified being," he said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Back in Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, he had witnessed how Elvinia had released such a terrifyingly powerful burst of light.</p>

  <p>Yet at that time, the Great Sanskrit Light, which had descended from the sky, was only sustained for a short period of time. Now, the Great Sanskrit Light that came from the space crack was almost too dazzling, as if it was going to change the entire Dark Region into the Light Region.</p>

  <p>It meant only one thing, and that was Elvinia's abilities had improved.</p>

  <p>"A purified being?" Hans gasped.</p>

  <p>His originally enlarged eyes glinted with anxiety.</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed it, and wondered what Hans was worried about. Before he could ask about it, Hans' eyes closed shut and he fell straight down.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes narrowed into slits as he looked up at the huge crack in the sky.</p>

  <p>He suddenly felt curious. "How could the crack be filled with Great Sanskrit Light? What kind of world is inside?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>Even Elvinia couldn't answer the question, and unfortunately it was also impossible for him to explore the crack now.</p>

  <p>He was still in the Dark Region and didn't know how long the crack would be there. Once it closed, the Dark Region would probably be back again.</p>

  <p>Without Hans' disturbance, the thunder wings on his back spread out once more. Zheng sped up in the air and quickly left the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Star Falcon race had seen Zheng and Hans enter the Dark Region, but they didn't expect such a strange thing to happen. When they saw Zheng fly back with the help of the thunder wings, all the Star Falcons immediately flew away in all directions.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't plan on chasing and killing them anyway.</p>

  <p>Now that Hans, the chief of the Star Falcon race was dead, all the other things could be easily solved.</p>

  <p>Just as the Star Falcons had flown away, the crack in the sky slowly healed, and the incandescent light gradually disappeared into the crack. The Dark Region had engulfed the originally white-colored area, and it was once again covered in darkness.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng saw the endless darkness envelope the space in front of him, something popped up in his mind. The Dark Region and the Light Region belonged to two different areas, but he didn't know how the Dark Region came into being.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's thunder wings let out a sizzling sound. He flew up towards the Heavenly Dark Mountain and Earthly Dark Mountain at once.</p>

  <p>When he passed through the ridge that was connected to the two mountains, he saw Clyde and Raul, as well as Elvinia who was in Raul's huge palm.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned and immediately flew down.</p>

  <p>The two creatures of the Other Shore, Raul and Clyde, did not react at all until now.</p>

  <p>They just stayed there with dull expressions on their faces. "What happened to Elvinia?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can blame it on what happened just now. She used too much of her strength," Raul said and pointed up at the sky far away. "So, she fainted."</p>

  <p>Placing his hand on Elvinia's forehead, Zheng detected that her soul wasn't damaged and her breathing was even. He was relieved. Afterwards, he gently lifted her off Raul's palm and put her on his back.</p>

  <p>"Let's go back and discuss the thing further!" As he spoke, he spread out his wings and flew towards the direction of the Myriad Spirits City.</p>

  <p>Just like that, the battle with the Star Falcon race ended.</p>

  <p>Zheng had originally thought that things would've gone simpler. It turned out that he had underestimated the creatures on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Another day had passed.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was busy as the strong warriors of the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race gathered together in the City Guard House.</p>

  <p>A creature from the Other Shore stood in the front of the hall. He looked like a human being even with his blue skin, long hands and feet, and the long beard on his face that touched the ground.</p>

  <p>"Who is this?" Zheng asked upon seeing the strange creature. "He belongs to the Riverside race," Clyde answered respectfully.</p>

  <p>There was a time when Zheng heard that the Riverside race belonged in the Myriad Spirits City before.</p>

  <p>Later on, they moved to the Sky Water City. All of them were known for being skillful craftsmen.</p>

  <p>"The Riverside race? From the Sky Water City?" Zheng asked. "Sir, all the members of the Star Falcon race have fled back to the Sky Water City after they were defeated.</p>

  <p>Now, the Sky Water City is in a mess, and our race is also suffering. Please send people to drive the Star Falcon race out of the Sky Water City!" the man from the Riverside race pleaded.</p>

  <p>Overall, the creatures of the Other Shore in the city had lived in peace when the Star Falcon race had controlled the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>Yet, the Star Falcon race suddenly became weak, so the races they had suppressed naturally started to rebel. Some races even intended to eliminate the whole Star Falcon race, as proof of their surrender to Zheng, just like what the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race had done before.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the members of the Riverside race were born to be fond of peace and calm life, and didn't like to fight with other races. That was why the man from the Riverside race had rushed to the Myriad Spirits City, in hopes that Zheng would occupy the Sky Water City right away.</p>

  <p>"Sir, we, the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race will go to the Sky Water City. There's no need for you to go there in person!" Clyde added hastily.</p>

  <p>Zheng casually glanced at Clyde, then was able to read his mind.</p>

  <p>The Star Falcon race had lost its core leaders after Hans and Garth died. As a result, their fighting capacity was reduced by several levels. Zheng could now conquer the Sky Water City quite easily.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Elvinia had been in a coma since she returned to the City Guard House. Thus, Zheng wasn't in the mood to besiege the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>Besides, he wasn't in a hurry--but the Guide Weasel race and the Giant race were extremely anxious!</p>

  <p>Of course, he would leave Stage Fourteen sooner or later. By then, the two races would work together to control the Sky Water City and the Myriad Spirits City. That was what they had been dreaming of for so long. In the past, they could only fantasize about such a thing. Now that they already had a foundation to realize their dreams, what else could they do but pursue them?</p>

  <p>To wipe out the Star Falcon race, the Guide Weasel race had most likely instigated the Riverside race to seek help from Zheng.</p>

  <p>"In this case, you can go there and fight," Zheng said faintly.</p>

  <p>His words were like a king's decree as Clyde and Raul quickly lit up with excitement. In a snap, they were gone along with the man from the Riverside race.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the news about the defeat of the Star Falcon race and Hans' death had spread throughout the Sky Water City. At that time, most of the members of the Star Falcon race tried to stabilize and comfort the other races of the Other Shore in the Sky Water City.</p>

  <p>When dusk came, six members of the Star Falcon race quietly left the Sky Water City and flew south.</p>

  <p>Many great races in the Source World had chosen to establish their strongholds in the Myriad Spirits City or the Sky Water City, but there were some exceptions.</p>

  <p>For example, the stronghold of Pear Hill wasn't located in either of those cities, but at another area in Stage Fourteen. After a while of flying in the air, the six members of the Star Falcon race finally landed on top of the Pear Hill stronghold.</p>
