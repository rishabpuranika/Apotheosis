<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled. "I just want to end this meaningless war."</p>

  <p>With these words, the queen's face revealed a sudden expression of surprise. "Can you do it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded, his gaze circling the area. Quite a few of the other warriors who were engaged in the fierce battle had also taken notice of Zheng.</p>

  <p>He raised his arm above his head slightly, which sent a shudder of confusion rippling through the crowd.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, the general standing behind Zheng suddenly pulled out a dagger and rushed toward him.</p>

  <p>He started the war on behalf of Totem Clan's king and was about to obtain his ultimate and final victory. How could he let this mysterious fellow in front of him prevent him from righteousness?</p>

  <p>The queen spoke her warning:</p>

  <p>"Be careful!"</p>

  <p>Despite such, Zheng didn't budge, or he didn't even move an inch. Instead, he stood motionless as the general twisted his body in order to stab his dagger into Zheng's heart.</p>

  <p>In his inner world, Zheng was the absolute controller. Here, not only was he in an 'omniscient' state, but he was also in an 'omnipotent' state. How could he simply let that dagger pierce his heart?</p>

  <p>As soon as the sharp tip of the dagger poked at Zheng's skin, fine cracks began to appear on its surface, forming upward inch by inch. The dagger shattered into hundreds of small pieces, scattering themselves all over the ground.</p>

  <p>"What an idiot!" Zheng spat these few words.</p>

  <p>He then shook his body slightly while glaring at the general and suddenly, the general was sent flying up into the air. He continued to rise higher and higher as Zheng held his gaze.</p>

  <p>A hundred feet, at first.</p>

  <p>Then, a thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Ten thousand feet and the general was completely out of sight.</p>

  <p>In this era, there wasn't yet a person at Illuminating Soul Realm, and even the strongest one was only a nature creature.</p>

  <p>And as flying was their wildest dream, this general was the first person to actually achieve it.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't kill him, though. He only threw the general thousands and thousands of feet in the air. As the creator of this world, his world, Zheng wouldn't just casually kill the creatures he himself had created. 'How meaningless!' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>That was when Zheng raised his arm once again.</p>

  <p>At that, all the weapons in everyone's hands began to vibrate. The warriors tried to hold on strong, but couldn't resist and the weapons went flying away.</p>

  <p>Tinkling! Tinkling! Tinkling!</p>

  <p>Machetes, long swords, sharp spears, shiny daggers, bows and arrows…</p>

  <p>All sorts of weapons were now gathered above Zheng's head, forming a misshapen ball of iron and metal.</p>

  <p>All Zheng had to do now was point. And he did so with utmost gentleness.</p>

  <p>The weapons once above his head now began to disappear one at a time, reversing back into brown streams of chaotic energy and dissipating into the world.</p>

  <p>Once the chaotic energy had solidified into soil, various kinds of iron, copper, and gold ores formed in the soil.</p>

  <p>And after the humans had mastered the art of metallurgy, they refined the metal within it and then forged various weapons. However, whether those were steel machetes or iron swords, they were all made up of chaotic energy and could be reverted back to chaotic energy by Zheng at any time.</p>

  <p>Even the green spears that came from the World Tree were formed after the World Tree absorbed the chaotic energy, and therefore their essence was chaotic energy, too.</p>

  <p>From the Totem Clan all the way to the Howe Clan warriors, everyone was absolutely stunned by the scene they had all just observed.</p>

  <p>Everyone had stopped fighting now, not only out of amazement, but also because they had lost their weapons.</p>

  <p>"You… You're a god!"</p>

  <p>The queen was the first to react, dropping to her knees before Zheng. Her exquisite body crawled on the ground toward him and her face was devout, void of any hesitation.</p>

  <p>"He's a god!"</p>

  <p>"He's God of Creation!"</p>

  <p>"He is the legendary creator of the nine stars!"</p>

  <p>"No, more than that! He supports this world. He is the Venerable Creator!"</p>

  <p>Many people cried out in awe as they too, fell to their knees in disbelief and amazement.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the cries of his people, Zheng wasn't sure whether he felt like laughing or crying.</p>

  <p>He was indeed the God of Creation of this world, but what the hell was the creator of nine stars? What about the Venerable Creator?</p>

  <p>Zheng got the answers he was looking for almost at the same time he asked himself the question. He was used to the feeling of omniscience. After, he was not only omniscient about his inner world, but equally omniscient about the one million great worlds in the universe.</p>

  <p>During the evolution of these civilizations, there were many legends that had been written in detail about the existence of "gods". For example, the creator of the nine stars was a god that the Totem Clan worshipped, while the Venerable Creator was the legendary God of Creation worshipped by Howe Clan. They believed that there was a god under this world, who could hold the entire world on his shoulders, and they thus called him the Venerable Creator.</p>

  <p>"Listen up! After such a war, there are too few of you left. I... I don't want you to kill each other anymore!" Zheng looked down at the queen and added softly.</p>

  <p>"But Your Mightiness! It was Totem Clan that initiated this war against us!" said the queen, emotionally.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and said, "I know."</p>

  <p>With that, he waved his hand.</p>

  <p>The whoosh of his hand suddenly made all the wounds on the queen's body disappear into thin air. Her delicate, flawless skin returned as if it had never been damaged in the first place.</p>

  <p>The queen was stunned and her expression became even more excited.</p>

  <p>She once again threw herself to the ground in worship. "Thank you, Your Mightiness!"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and with a second light swipe of his hand, a lump of soil appeared on the ground, instantly transforming itself into an exquisite scepter. The scepter was inserted into the ground in front of the queen.</p>

  <p>"With the power that I bestow upon you, rule over your people well…"</p>

  <p>The queen stared blankly at the exquisite scepter. She wanted to say something, but Zheng's figure had already disappeared from her sight.</p>

  <p>"This... This is a scepter given to me by the Venerable Creator," the queen's entire body began to tremble. She was, after all, the queen of Howe Clan, and understood the significance of this scepter.</p>

  <p>Even if the scepter had no power in and of itself, it represented the favor of god and it was also a symbol of status.</p>

  <p>Of course, at the time of its creation, Zheng had never expected that in the future, the scepter would become the most precious treasure in this world. The scepter that symbolized highest authority would eventually be pursued by countless ambitious people.</p>

  <p>The war between Totem Clan and Howe Clan was also known as the war of gods.</p>

  <p>It was not until long after Zheng had disappeared that the queen picked up the scepter and slowly stood up. Her expression still looked lost, deep in her thoughts.</p>

  <p>The instant Zheng had disappeared, he reappeared in a tribe thousands of miles away.</p>

  <p>Here was Totem Clan - and everyone was singing and dancing.</p>

  <p>According to the news that came from the frontlines, the Totem Clan had already achieved complete victory. Countless slaves would enter their account, along with an endless amount of wealth and land.</p>

  <p>And it went without saying that the Totem Clan's king was in a very good mood. He believed that the general would bring that woman back.</p>

  <p>He had been yearning day and night for that enchanting lady.</p>

  <p>But the queen of Howe Clan couldn't be brought back. Instead, the one who appeared before him was Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You, who the hell are you… Someone, an assassin!" The king shouted in fear. He had no clue how this ghost-like fellow had entered his tent unnoticed.</p>

  <p>Zheng simply waved his hand and the general, still hanging mid-air, appeared next to Zheng. With a discreet flick of his finger, Zheng threw the general to the ground.</p>

  <p>"General, general…" The king was now even more surprised. "Quick, kill this person for me!"</p>

  <p>He hadn't thought that the fierce and heroic general would kneel towards Zheng as soon as he landed, nor did he expect him to prostrate himself on the ground.</p>

  <p>"My god, please forgive us, Totem Clan, for starting this war!" said the general, with utmost respect.</p>

  <p>The creatures of this era were still in an uncultured state. No matter how brave the great general was, once he confirmed Zheng's ability, there was no way he was going against him!</p>

  <p>"You, you are a god…" When the king heard the general's words, his fat face filled with a dazed expression.</p>

  <p>"Stop the war with Howe Clan," Zheng said, paying no attention to the king's utterings. With those words, Zheng's figure dissipated into a faint shadow and then disappeared completely.</p>

  <p>After mediating that war, Zheng once again entered the World Tree.</p>

  <p>Right now, Zheng's inner world was too small and wasn't yet prosperous enough. For this reason, he couldn't and wouldn't allow the creatures on the World Tree to start a war within the humans.</p>

  <p>Zheng also encountered a little resistance here, with the World Tree. This green skinned race was called the Heavenly Spirit race.</p>

  <p>They themselves were extremely weak, but with the help of the World Tree's power, they possessed theurgy that was unmatched by humans.</p>

  <p>That was why they had the urge to conquer that continent.</p>

  <p>Zheng immediately appeared at the top of the World Tree and found the king of the Heavenly Spirit race, issuing a warning of his own.</p>

  <p>He separated the World Tree and the continent. These two worlds couldn't start a war with each other for at least ten thousand years!</p>

  <p>Once this inner world had had the time to truly flourish, Zheng wouldn't interfere too much, even if there would be more wars in future. After all, the development of his inner world and the derivation of civilization all had their own rules. Interfering too much might not be a good thing.</p>

  <p>Zheng's warning was very effective. Perhaps the Heavenly Spirit race had their own belief, but they also believed in the existence of gods. Zheng's theurgy was clearly the same as the gods in all the legends and there was no way they could resist.</p>

  <p>The only thing that disappointed the Heavenly Spirit race was that Zheng's appearance looked like the human being, nothing like their Heavenly Spirit race…</p>
