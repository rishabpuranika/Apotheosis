<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2884 The Sea Cracking Skull </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In a palace on the Floating Island of the Han Clan, Pascal sat cross-legged as he put the ring he was holding into his elixir field.</p>

  <p>At the other end of the palace, Samuel was pacing restlessly to and fro.</p>

  <p>Samuel had declared that he was cultivating in seclusion when in fact, it was Pascal who was in seclusion.</p>

  <p>Leyton had given Samuel the Truth of Dark and Light Chaos, but he hadn't been able to practice it because of the ring in Pascal's hand.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Pascal was completely under Samuel's control, which was why Samuel was able to use the ring's power as he wished. But the power he was able to wield was not all that the Abyss Demon Region had.</p>

  <p>Pascal stood between Samuel and the ring, partially blocking Samuel's view as if a thick veil separated them.</p>

  <p>"You can give the ring to me," Rosie said with a small smile from the corner she was sitting in as she watched Samuel's impatience rise.</p>

  <p>Samuel stopped and glared at her.</p>

  <p>"If you don't want to give it to me, you can give it to someone else. Alfredo, for example," Rosie said hurriedly.</p>

  <p>Alfredo was also a consummate True God who had been loyal to the Han Clan, which made Rosie's suggestion all the more acceptable.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible," Samuel said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>He didn't trust anyone except himself.</p>

  <p>He had actually come up with a solution, which was to get back Pascal's Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>But he knew what kind of person Pascal was. If Pascal were to know what he had done, he would never help him and would turn against him.</p>

  <p>"You have no choice left in that case. When the Other Shore Realm warriors of the Nine Li race enter the divine land, you will all be dead. Enjoy yourself while you can," Rosie said glibly.</p>

  <p>Samuel was irritated at her words.</p>

  <p>She had gone too far.</p>

  <p>He had known her capabilities, which was why he had taken her out of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>But her ability would cost a massive amount of the Faith Energy. During the battle between the Abyss Demon Region and the alliance of the powerful clans, she had almost exhausted the Faith Energy that had accumulated in the Abyss Demon Region for so many years. It would take a long time to accumulate enough Faith Energy before she could use the ability again, but it was already too late.</p>

  <p>She meant nothing to him at the moment, but she ridiculed him all day and succeeded in distracting and irritating him.</p>

  <p>"You! Shut up!" Samuel shouted angrily.</p>

  <p>Rosie squared her shoulders and looked at Samuel, her eyes hardened and an indifferent smile on her face.</p>

  <p>Samuel secretly ordered Pascal, who was sitting upright, to lift the ring up.</p>

  <p>Streaks of black lightning shot towards Rosie.</p>

  <p>The black energy wrapped around Rosie's body, leaving scars on her snow-white skin.</p>

  <p>Rosie groaned in pain, curling her body into itself. The pain was unbearable, but her eyes were still clear. She looked at Samuel mockingly, something that upset him even more.</p>

  <p>Samuel snorted coldly before stepping into the void and disappearing from the palace.</p>

  <p>The next moment, he had appeared in the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>At the center of the square in front of the Hall of Holy Beings lay a bone like no other.</p>

  <p>The bone was in the shape of a strange fish's skull. More than 30 sharp teeth lined the giant mouth that was more than a thousand feet wide.</p>

  <p>An ordinary person would, at first glance, feel the will emanating from the skull. The will contained a destructive power that no one could resist. If this were to be activated, it would destroy everything in this world.</p>

  <p>No one knew how many hundred million years ago this strange fish died.</p>

  <p>But if it was emitting such a strong will even now, just how powerful did it have to be when it was alive? And who had killed it?</p>

  <p>Every time he saw the strange fish's skull, Samuel was overcome with awe and would sigh at the wonderful power of the Source World.</p>

  <p>He had learned from Leyton that this skull was known as the Sea Cracking Skull and was an exclusive forbidden weapon of the Yellow Emperor race.</p>

  <p>They had used this forbidden weapon to slaughter all the members of the Nine Li race in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Samuel might control the Abyss Demon Region, but he couldn't imagine the extent of such a magical power.</p>

  <p>And one needed to pay a high price to activate this forbidden weapon.</p>

  <p>Just as Samuel appeared in the Hall of Holy Beings, a transmission channel materialized in the sky.</p>

  <p>It fell straight down and pierced the fish's mouth, bathing it in a blood light.</p>

  <p>The space channel began to tremble and thousands of True Gods fell from it.</p>

  <p>They were all living people.</p>

  <p>Among them were divine citizens, low-rank True Gods, and powerful top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>All of them were panicking, anxious and confused.</p>

  <p>An irresistible force wrapped around them, immobilizing them and making it difficult for them to resist.</p>

  <p>Five minutes ago, they were in a divine city at the northeast of the divine land.</p>

  <p>Some of them were practicing hard, hoping to break through their own shackles and advance further in the Godly Way. As long as they had the confidence and infinite longevity, they could, one day, achieve success.</p>

  <p>Some were working hard only for a few divine might coins and were hoping to seek greater benefits.</p>

  <p>Then someone had appeared in the air above the divine city.</p>

  <p>The Hundred Commandments Slate in the divine city had attacked the person at once, but he didn't seem to flinch. One wave of his big hand sent an unimaginable aura around the city, enveloping it. And then, everyone in the city had been pulled out by an invisible force and sucked into the space channel.</p>

  <p>They had no idea about the catastrophe they were about to face.</p>

  <p>A man fell into the fish's mouth and touched the blood light. He turned into a cloud of blood mist almost instantly and then disappeared completely.</p>

  <p>The others paled at this sight.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to die!"</p>

  <p>"What's this?"</p>

  <p>"Argh!"</p>

  <p>Some resisted the force while others roared and clanked against it in desperation.</p>

  <p>But it was all in vain. How could True Gods resist the power of the Other Shore Realm?</p>

  <p>The blood light in the huge fish's mouth could devour over ten thousand people every three seconds.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before more than one hundred thousand people of a medium-sized divine city were devoured.</p>

  <p>The space channel closed after a while.</p>

  <p>The blood light in the fish's mouth had also receded, but dark blood burned in its empty eye sockets. One of its sharp teeth was also lined red.</p>

  <p>Samuel passed the huge fish skull and bowed to Leyton who was behind it.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Master Leyton! There are more blood lines."</p>

  <p>Leyton had told him before that only when the sharp teeth in the fish's mouth were full of blood lines could this weapon be activated. Now there were only four teeth with blood lines. He didn't know how many more people were to be devoured before this could be activated.</p>
