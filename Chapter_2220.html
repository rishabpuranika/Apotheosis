<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Madam Moon hadn't got the slightest idea about Zheng's origins.</p>

  <p>And although she wasn't considered popular in the Purple Soul Hall, she was actually an important figure.</p>

  <p>While the Purple Soul Hall didn't determine one's importance according to seniority, and all female disciples were like sisters, basic rules still had to be observed.</p>

  <p>That was why Joy granted Madam Moon such great power, which granted her a status similar to that of the elders in some sects who enforced the laws. In addition, she came to grow subconsciously suspicious of some people, which came with her many experiences.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Joy had personally allowed Luo Zheng to enter the Floating Island of the Han Clan and that Mae had paid a visit to the Han Clan's ancestral land--but Madam Moon thought that she had to help her master check up on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Your opponent?" Madam Moon sneered. "There are too many! But here in the Jade Wall of Legends, you can choose them at will."</p>

  <p>"But how do I find my opponent?" asked Luo Zheng. His eyes drifted to the huge Jade Wall of Legends once again. He truly was confused, but he did have a rough plan of how to do it in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Just put the jade token I gave to you in front of the Jade Wall of Legends," Madam Moon said and pointed towards the distance.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Zheng followed the direction where Madam Moon had pointed and walked towards the Jade Wall of Legends. Only then did he find that the area below the Jade Wall was not a level ground, but had many small grooves. He pulled out the jade token that Madam Moon had given him and placed it in one of the grooves. At the same time, he activated the jade token.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The moment the jade token was activated, a ripple disturbed the smooth surface of the Jade Wall in front of him, and the name "Tianxing Luo" appeared on it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had assumed the name of "Tianxing Luo" to enter the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>After the Purple Soul Hall had used that name to register him, it was that same name that appeared on the Jade Wall as well. In addition to his name, it also recorded the number of the round he had taken part in and his point. In his case, both the numbers were currently zero.</p>

  <p>Just then, a beam of light came out from the Jade Wall of Legends and enveloped him within it.</p>

  <p>"This beam of light..." he muttered.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his eyes lit up as if he seemed to have realized something.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the first time he had seen such kind of light. Back when the Evolutionary Universe had held a competition for the world of chaos, they had claimed that its purpose was to select talents in the world of chaos when in reality, they had used the trillions of warriors who had participated to temper the Godly Geniuses through fights.</p>

  <p>During that time, he had relied on that same kind of light to engulf him so that he could enter the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>It was highly possible that his father had created the Illusion Battlefield based on the Jade Wall of Legends in the Floating Islands. After all, his father dominated the Evolutionary Universe, and the Illusion Battlefield he had built was even greater and more complicated.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng felt his head was filled with a buzzing, humming noise.</p>

  <p>The real world that surrounded him began to collapse rapidly, then he quickly sank into an illusionary world. He also realized that he could no longer feel the existence of Master Evil!</p>

  <p>"So it really is like what I have guessed!" As Luo Zheng stood between the heaven and earth in the illusionary world, he finally understood the use of the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>He then thought that there must be more than one Jade Wall of Legends like the one he had just seen, and that there should be a large number of them in the Floating Islands above the Time Sea. It was through the Jade Walls of Legends that they could project all of the True Gods into the illusionary world, and engage them in fights.</p>

  <p>Master Evil had just said that the Jade Wall of Legends could determine the rankings of the Floating Islands, and now Luo Zheng understood what he meant.</p>

  <p>When he had placed his jade token in front of the Jade Wall of Legends, he saw that he had zero points. That was because it was the first time that he had entered the Jade Wall.</p>

  <p>As a member of the Han Clan, he was supposed to represent the clan in battles. Every time he would win a battle, he would get a small amount of points. Meanwhile, the proven godly warriors, True Gods, and even the consummate True Gods on the Han Clan Floating Island, all had to choose their battles to fight to accumulate points.</p>

  <p>A Floating Island's rank was determined by the total number of points of all the warriors of that Floating Island.</p>

  <p>However, Holy Beings did not participate in the whole process of determining rankings; instead, they sent their disciples to fight for them.</p>

  <p>'Warriors who are truly powerful, like Harold and Augustus, must have countless points already. While the proven godly warriors might not get any points, or they could only get a few, the noble clans will still consider them as greatly important. Therefore, the three women from the Dream Pavilion would be severely punished if their rankings dropped in the bottom 300. I wonder who is my first opponent in the Jade Wall of Legends?' Luo Zheng thought as he stood there in silence.</p>

  <p>His musings were interrupted when a light slowly flashed in front of him. A speck of dust drifted up, and more dust followed. The dust continued to condense and soon turned into a human figure, then a man in brown embroidered clothes appeared in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The man sized him up with mocking eyes and said, "Is it also your first time to enter the Arena of Legends? According to the rules of the Arena of Legends, the opponent for me should also be a newcomer to this arena."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded slightly. Apparently, the place that they had entered through the Jade Wall of Legends was called the Arena of Legends. It was the place where warriors fought.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's defense, it wasn't his fault since the old lady didn't make it clear to him, nor did she even tell him the rules. She just let him come in and fight. Perhaps this Madam Moon thought that he was a swindler, so she threw him directly into the Arena of Legends. If he lost, she would probably drive him out of the Floating Island...</p>

  <p>When the man saw Luo Zheng nod, his lips curved up into a wry smile. "Then you really are unlucky," he said and sighed, as if he was mourning for his opponent.</p>

  <p>"Why did you say that?" Luo Zheng asked in surprise. The man simply laughed.</p>

  <p>"Because I'll definitely defeat you in your first fight! Remember my name. My name is Herman Tang! You should be greatly honored to fight me!" Herman Tang said proudly.</p>

  <p>Not only was Herman Tang a warrior from the top ten Floating Islands, he was also the son of a Demi-holy Being from the Tang Clan.</p>

  <p>It was known that he had finally embarked on his own path after practicing hard for seventeen years!</p>

  <p>Herman Tang was famous on the Floating Islands. At the very least, many True Gods knew that there was such a genius in the Tang Clan.</p>

  <p>It was also Herman Tang's first time to step into the Arena of Legends.</p>

  <p>He planned to have a winning streak in the fights between proven godly warriors because his strength had far surpassed those of the martial artists of the same level. In other words, most of the proven godly warriors didn't even deserve to fight with him!</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng simply looked at his arrogant face and flatly said, "Oh, can we start now?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," Herman Tang said with a boisterous laugh. Then, two very different fingerprints condensed in both of his hands.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Herman Tang never thought that he was the one who was unlucky to encounter Luo Zheng when he stepped into the Arena of Legends for the first time.</p>

  <p>Compared with the complicated skills that Herman Tang was about to use, Zheng's method was simple and efficient.</p>

  <p>He swept his body along the ground and approached Herman Tang at an extremely fast speed. His eyes glowed with a golden light and a strange smile tugged at the corners of his lips.</p>

  <p>"Soul attack? So stupid..."</p>

  <p>Herman Tang felt the soul pressure that burst out from Zheng's eyes. For a moment, he felt disdainful.</p>

  <p>However, that feeling only lasted for a second. When Luo Zheng turned his stream of soul pressure into a sharp arrow and immediately rushed into his mind, he realized that the soul pressure was much more powerful than he had imagined.</p>

  <p>It turned out that he was the stupid one, and not his opponent!</p>

  <p>Moreover, he was the unlucky one, and not his opponent as well!</p>

  <p>Many others thought that Herman Tang was the new, shining star of the Tang Clan. He himself had also claimed to be an invincible proven godly warrior, but he had never thought that he would fight a freak with such a strong soul in his first battle no less!</p>

  <p>As the son of a Demi-holy Being, Daniel Tang was quick to react. He had a much better reaction time than the proven godly warriors from the masses. In fact, the proven godly warriors on the Floating Islands were more than one level stronger than those from the other places in the divine land--but it was clearly because all the talents of the whole divine land were gathered in the Floating Islands above the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>When Herman sensed that Zheng's soul pressure was too strong, he had thought of a counterattack. He knew that his opponent would immediately launch a deadly attack after he had hurt his soul.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had used the same skill to defeat Eric back when he was in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant.</p>

  <p>Then again, Herman Tang was much stronger than Eric. With gritted teeth, he almost used up all his strength to retreat in an attempt to avoid Zheng's deadly attack.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, even though he had predicted it beforehand, he still failed to dodge it.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's fist hit Herman Tang square on his body. He aimed his punch directly at his opponent with no frills, but his punch was far from what Herman Tang could bear.</p>

  <p>'His speed, strength and soul are far beyond my imagination. Is he really a proven godly warrior?'</p>

  <p>A confused look was written across his face, before his body disintegrated.</p>
