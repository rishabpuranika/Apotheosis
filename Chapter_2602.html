<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2602 A Visit To Snake Goddess Race </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Thirteen thousand years ago, a ferocious battle between the Nine Li race and Yellow Emperor race took place. As a result of that debacle, the Sky South Bone Tower was shut down.</p>

  <p>The two great races came to an agreement. Since the Sky South Bone Tower had been closed, they started to develop the Immemorial Wilderness right underneath it.</p>

  <p>However, the tower was finally in the hands of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>The members of the race failed to hide their excitement, especially Giacomo and Erik.</p>

  <p>The honor of helping the Nine Li race possess another bone tower was comparable to that of the emperors of the mortals expanding territories.</p>

  <p>Adele, however, seemed a little caught up in her own thoughts as she allowed her beautiful orbs to constantly glance at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The changes his arrival could cause the Nine Li race were unknown to her, but she was certain that her father's words had something to do with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Could he really lead the Nine Li race to leave this world?</p>

  <p>Not long after, the bone boat slowly approached the center of the Sky South Bone Tower. There was a crack of a thousand feet long in the middle which served as an entrance for the boat.</p>

  <p>The races were always competing for those cracks. Through them, an entire race could hide and avoid the Light of Adjudication every thousand years.</p>

  <p>A huge red seal which was also hundreds of thousands of feet wide swirled around the crack.</p>

  <p>The scarlet aura circled the seal, which meant that there was possible trouble to come for anyone who came near.</p>

  <p>That seal was created by the exiles of both the Nine Li race and Yellow Emperor race. Once it was removed, the two races would be alerted.</p>

  <p>"Grand Elder, it's time to remove the seal." Giacomo, who was standing next to the absent-minded Adele, felt her vibe and quietly nudged her.</p>

  <p>That gesture snapped her back to reality. Embarrassed that he noticed, she could only smile at Giacomo while nodding her head softly.</p>

  <p>Naturally, she was the one who could remove the seal of the Sky South Bone Tower. After all, she was the Grand Elder of the race.</p>

  <p>In the presence of everyone, Adele began to grow and her body started to swell up.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Ten thousand feet...</p>

  <p>A hundred thousand feet...</p>

  <p>A million feet...</p>

  <p>And four million feet!</p>

  <p>The huge body she now possessed was a brutal view for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If one who had cultivated the Wild God system reached that kind of level, they became much powerful than a Holy Being in terms of pure strength.</p>

  <p>When he had first come to this world, Luo Zheng had seen a giant who was hundreds of miles tall fighting in the Immemorial Wilderness. However, he surmised that Adele was even taller than that one.</p>

  <p>'Just how many wild bones would it take for me to reach this level?' Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>The competition between the two races ended, and the next thing they were going to do was find a way out of this world. Luo Zheng didn't know what the old man would do, but he planned on absorbing as many wild bones as he could no matter what.</p>

  <p>Everyone on the bone ship looked up at Adele.</p>

  <p>She was violently slapping the seal.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>There was a sudden explosion, which caused the entire area to shake.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the massive seal began to roll upwards.</p>

  <p>Adele's wide palm was continuously slapping the seal as it kept on moving. When the entire seal was curled to a certain extent, it began to break into pieces.</p>

  <p>It quickly dissipated and flew with the wind like dust.</p>

  <p>Adele then deactivated her Wild God Power and returned to her normal size. Slowly, she walked back to the boat.</p>

  <p>They proceeded to check inside the Sky South Bone Tower while the others stood guard.</p>

  <p>They had planned to transfer several major sects attached to their race into the tower after occupying it. With such space, they could hold more warriors from the wilderness.</p>

  <p>Together with Adele, Luo Zheng went back to the Sky Spirit Bone Tower.</p>

  <p>They only had two years left before the coming of the Light of Adjudication.</p>

  <p>Even if Zelda and Luther were already in a safe state, they still had a lot of things to do in those two years.</p>

  <p>After all, a mere Nine Li race might not be able to protect the siblings.</p>

  <p>If they couldn't enter a bone tower, they could be purified and turned into ashes along with everything after the Light of Adjudication.</p>

  <p>Even someone like Luo Zheng wouldn't stand a chance against that kind of phenomenon.</p>

  <p>In the Sky Spirit Bone Tower, Luo Zheng also made sure to spend all of his time absorbing the Wild God Power in the wild bones.</p>

  <p>There certainly was a huge quantity of wild bones stored in the Nine Li race. Baldwin, who was in charge of the distribution of wild bones, was in awe when he saw how Luo Zheng absorbed them.</p>

  <p>However, Baldwin didn't dare say anything. He had heard a lot of rumors about his fight against the Yellow Emperor race, and he sure didn't want to get himself involved in conflicts.</p>

  <p>It was believed that the reason why the Nine Li race won the Sky South Bone Tower was because of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The contribution Elsa and Romeo had done was nothing compared to Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Even Doran, who had once fought Luo Zheng for the use of the Cave of Wildness, was now convinced of his power.</p>

  <p>Six days later, the old man approached Luo Zheng ever so quietly.</p>

  <p>He looked at the strong Wild God Power in Luo Zheng's body and said calmly,</p>

  <p>"If things go on like this, it won't be long before you can break through and become a top-rank Wild God."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng opened his eyes and smiled, "I'm just afraid that time is not enough."</p>

  <p>"Cultivating the Wild God system is a shortcut, and time is not that big of a problem," the old man replied.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng only nodded in response.</p>

  <p>The old man was right. Absorbing the Wild God Power from the wild bones was indeed a shortcut. It was undeniably faster than cultivating the Grand World Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing I don't understand however," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Please, go ahead," the old man coaxed him.</p>

  <p>"When I faced David, I noticed that he activated the power of his bloodline. It seemed that the token contained in the blood power of the Yellow Emperor race was very powerful. How come we don't have something like that in our race?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>If the Nine Li race's three heads and six arms equated to the Yellow Emperor race's golden light shield, then the token that David used was something he possessed after his blood power had reached a certain level. That black light also posed a great threat to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The purity of Luo Zheng's bloodline was definitely not lesser than that of David's. However, Luo Zheng only got three heads and six arms after breaking through the Body Tribulations. He never got any bloodline token, nor did he hear anyone speak of it.</p>

  <p>The old man smiled and said, "Our bloodline is not inferior to theirs, I can assure you that. But you are a direct descendant of the Grand Chieftain. It's difficult for me to predict when you could activate the bloodline token. However, I believe that sooner or later, you will."</p>

  <p>In the past years, there had never been a warrior with the imperial-grade bloodline in the Nine Li race. Even the exiles didn't know much about the bloodline token of their race. The old man didn't have the answer.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng needed to figure that out by himself.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. It's time," the old man said.</p>

  <p>"Go where?" Luo Zheng asked, his eyebrows furrowed.</p>

  <p>"To pay a visit to the Snake Goddess race."</p>

  <p>Escaping the prison could be a challenge for the Nine Li race alone. But if they were to ally with the Snake Goddess race and summon the other races to help them, the chances of leaving could increase a great deal.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the Snake Goddess race had tied the divine land to the Torrent Bone Tower. They needed to solve that problem.</p>

  <p>They needed to make accurate preparations before they could take action, and Luo Zheng was a vital part of it all.</p>
