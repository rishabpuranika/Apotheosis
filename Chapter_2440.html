  <p>
</p>

  <p>Yan could be considered a cold and powerful goddess that dominated both life and death.</p>

  <p>As she sat next to Zheng however, her fingers trembled, just enough for Zheng to take notice.</p>

  <p>Upon perceiving this trivial detail, Zheng smiled and whispered through his chaotic energy, "Yan, if you're a little nervous, don't force yourself. I can handle it on my own."</p>

  <p>Yan hadn't experienced too much slaughter in her lifetime; at least, not yet.</p>

  <p>This was probably her first experience of killing a True God and therefore, it was only inevitable that she felt a little uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>It was perhaps because of Harold's teachings that Yan had behaved in such a way.</p>

  <p>All in all, it was clearly really hard for her.</p>

  <p>"I'm not nervous at all," Yan replied in a matter-of-fact tone, equally through her life vitality. "Zheng, you'd better absorb the Sunrest Wood Spring.</p>

  <p>I don't need it."</p>

  <p>As he looked at her serious expression, Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>He immediately put his hands directly into the cool spring.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Wood Spring was the Sunrest Tree's essence, which was so powerful that it could literally melt anything it came into contact with.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng immersed his hands into it, the green liquid automatically began gathering around his fingers, palms and wrists.</p>

  <p>Visibly, the Sunrest Wood Spring on the platform was gradually being absorbed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't spread the spring into his body however, but placed it instead into his cinnabar field along the meridians.</p>

  <p>Duke, on his behalf, occupied a different platform.</p>

  <p>On the edge of the platform stood two other top-rank True Gods from the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>One of them was named Gino Dongfang, and the other, Wesley Dongfang.</p>

  <p>This time, the three True Gods of the Dongfang Clan were very carefully hand-selected by Troy.</p>

  <p>"Duke, the Sunrest Wood Spring..." murmured Wesley, a young teenage warrior standing beside him.</p>

  <p>"Don't leave it to me. You can absorb it by yourselves." Duke shook his head as he replied. He didn't care about the Sunrest Wood Spring in the least.</p>

  <p>As he looked over at Yan, Duke felt very preoccupied. Gino, through his life vitality, secretly asked, "Duke, are you still worried about Yan? What kind of strength was she using? It doesn't seem to be any Godly Way, and even no internal momentum fluctuated. It's really strange!"</p>

  <p>Despite the questioning, Duke just shook his head and said, "No. I'm not worried about Yan."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? You aren't worried about her?" Gino was stunned for a brief moment. He rolled his eyes and asked, "In that case, you must be worried about the members of the Sword Clan, right?"</p>

  <p>This time, the Sword Clan had suddenly reduced the seats for wealthy clans on the Floating Islands, and the number of their people doubled. This was equivalent to announcing their position. Their purpose was to help Zheng and his sister obtain the skeleton's inheritance!</p>

  <p>Obviously, Reinhard, the head of the group, wasn't to be trifled with.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not," Duke stated, as he continued to shake his head.</p>

  <p>"Tell me then, who the hell are you worried about?" Gino looked puzzled.</p>

  <p>He knew that Duke was resourceful. Although he was only a top-rank True God, he was highly valued in the Dongfang Clan. Naturally, he was much more far-sighted than ordinary True Gods. He turned to glance at Zheng, who was slowly absorbing the Sunrest Wood Spring and asked, "Are you perhaps worried about Zheng?"</p>

  <p>"This time, I can't deny you. You're right." Duke squinted his eyes.</p>

  <p>As he took in Duke's response, Gino couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>"Duke, Zheng is said to be extremely powerful, but his cultivation level is very low. Do we really have to be afraid of him?"</p>

  <p>Wesley, who had also been absorbing the Sunrest Wood Spring, raised his head and said thinly, "It's amazing that he could defeat the low-rank True Gods when he was just a proving godly warrior. Now that he has become a low-rank True God, he is probably just as powerful as the best mid-rank True Gods, at most.</p>

  <p>You know, like the top two among the mid-rank True Gods on the Jade Wall of Legends!"</p>

  <p>Wesley genuinely thought highly of Zheng.</p>

  <p>Duke only nodded stiffly. "And yet, he hasn't taken a single action since he's entered the tree hole."</p>

  <p>"With such a powerful sister at his side, he simply doesn't need to do anything." Wesley shook his head and went back to absorb the Sunrest Wood Spring again.</p>

  <p>Duke was already well aware of everything they said, but he still felt that something was off, something was wrong.</p>

  <p>Moments ago, when he watched Brendan take action, he hadn't stopped him, because he wanted to test Zheng's current strength with Brendan's help.</p>

  <p>However, before Zheng even had the chance to respond in any way, Brendan had been killed by Yan.</p>

  <p>Now, the two Tang Clan men were still staring at both Zheng and Yan with red-rimmed eyes. They dared not beat Yan because of her powerful strength.</p>

  <p>"Gage, Donne, come here, both of you," said Duke through life vitality.</p>

  <p>Gage and Donne immediately turned their heads to look at Duke.</p>

  <p>"If you want to take your revenge, you have to be patient," said Duke calmly.</p>

  <p>Although the members of the alliance had the same goal, not a single one of them took the lead. Even Duke could do nothing more but command Wesley and Gino.</p>

  <p>In this very moment, Duke realized that he had to unite these people as one.</p>

  <p>Everywhere in Zheng's inner world, a green rain was gently falling.</p>

  <p>The big, beautiful raindrops fell around the World Tree.</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, another massive continent began to form itself around the life tree. As it began to absorb the raindrops, the entire tree shook rapidly.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>"That was quick!"</p>

  <p>Originally, the World Tree was more than ten thousand feet high.</p>

  <p>Now though, it grew at visibly high speeds.</p>

  <p>All of its branches began to extend, and the trunk also began to swell in size. As the roots buried deep in the ground continuously wriggled, the ground surrounding them began to ripple and crack.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the World Tree had grown from approximate ten thousand feet to over one hundred thousand feet high, and the number of the roots buried deep underground increased ten-fold!</p>

  <p>"What? What's going on?"</p>

  <p>As the World Tree expanded and swelled, Zheng could clearly feel his inner world starting to do the same.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng's avatar suddenly flashed and instantly arrived at the edge of his inner world.</p>

  <p>He gazed into the distance, a touch of bewilderment in his eyes. With a flick of his finger, a thin line brushed past the edge where he stood.</p>

  <p>There were a total of ten thousand and eight hundred golden Sanskrit words around his inner world. These golden Sanskrit words were equally spaced, with an exact distance of thirteen thousand miles between each one.</p>

  <p>The thin line drawn by Zheng, however, went sixteen inches further.</p>

  <p>The distance between each golden Sanskrit word was sixteen inches longer.</p>

  <p>"My inner world has expanded," Zheng concluded aloud.</p>

  <p>As his inner world continued to expand, the Sanskrit words surrounding it equally distanced themselves even more.</p>

  <p>The scope of this expansion was very small, and thus, Zheng hadn't felt anything different at all. That said though, he had confirmed it anyway.</p>

  <p>"The Sunrest Wood Spring is just the Sunrest Tree's life essence. Why can it expand my inner world?"</p>

  <p>Zheng felt utterly confused.</p>

  <p>The world in his cinnabar field was completely different from those of ordinary people. It was understandable that Zheng had to grope how to break through to the next cultivation level by himself.</p>

  <p>All of this had risen from his meager attempt to absorb the Sunrest Wood Spring into his body. He hadn't expected that there would really be such a change in his inner world.</p>
