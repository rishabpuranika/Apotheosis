<br/><br/>

  

  <p>In Zheng's inner mind, there were nine giant dragons that lay on a mysterious smelting furnace. Each appeared as natural as a living creature.</p>

  <p>The nine dragons seemed like engravings on the surface of the furnace.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was highly suspicious that they were not decorations at all, but real dragons with their own consciousness.</p>

  <p>For now, though, only one cyan dragon seemed to be gradually regaining consciousness as Zheng's heavenly essence had infiltrated its body. But from the moment it started to move until now, it had not communicated with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>So how did Luo Zheng realize the dragon's awakening? There had been two occasions when he was in crisis, and the dragon roared to help him get through those predicaments. The first was during the selection of the cultivation method at Heavenly Library, where he had to face the dominant pressure of Vengeful Beast. The second was during a fight against terrifying and angry ghosts in fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Other than those two occasions, the nine dragons usually seemed like decorations, lying quietly on the furnace without any smell of living creatures.</p>

  <p>But today, that one cyan dragon took the initiative to communicate with Luo Zheng. Why?</p>

  <p>It even told him about wanting to devour Jacques' bone spear. t was true that the mysterious smelting furnace had provided an undeniably large contribution to his current achievements, which he attained with great effort one step at a time. Without the furnace's support in forging his body and spirit at the beginning, and improving his martial arts skills tremendously, it would have been hard for Luo Zheng to leave the Luo family home.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was not aware of the origin of the furnace, he understood that the mystical equipment, with the nine dragons on it, as well as the black flame it produced, was highly valuable and powerful beyond his imagination, and should never be shown to anyone else.</p>

  <p>Even after using the black flame in the smelting furnace to melt his weapons and extract the heavenly essence, Luo Zheng would still carefully entrust Wurth with its auction. He never dared market it himself, for fear that should a setback occur during sales, someone watching might use it against him to plot something evil.</p>

  <p>He once heard an old maxim that said the precious stone landed its innocent possessor in jail. Luo Zheng took this to mean that an innocent man could get into big trouble because of his well-known wealth. Based on Zheng's present strength, once the secret leaked out, any advantage it might have would be lost and instead, it would only endanger his life because of those who would be after his treasure.</p>

  <p>So why was it that the cyan dragon was now sending him a message, asking for help to devour the bone spear?</p>

  <p>A very low-grade dragon, the flood dragon was only a subspecies.</p>

  <p>Despite its low grade, it belonged to the dragon family.</p>

  <p>After some thought, Luo Zheng came to the conclusion that the dragon smell hidden in the flood dragon's spine attracted the attention of the cyan dragon, making it extremely look forward to devouring the bone spear, so it had to communicate with him.</p>

  <p>But in doing so, the cyan dragon left Luo Zheng in a dilemma.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, Jacques was powerful. Although Luo Zheng used the power of dragon scales to knock him down and drive him out of the battle ring earlier, it didn't mean that the young disciple had more advantage over him. Jacques just underestimated his opponent's power, and in trying to crush Luo Zheng with brutal strength, he did not expect to get a dose of his own medicine.</p>

  <p>Because of arrogance, Jacques failed to display his real strength.</p>

  <p>Now with the dragon bone spear in hand, he got ready for a real fight.</p>

  <p>Examining the weapon in his hand made him sigh. This bone spear constantly exuded a sense of majesty, which was a deterrent inherited from its ancestors and born in its blood.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was unsure if he could defeat Jacques considering his top-grade power and weapon, which gave the man all the right to be arrogant.</p>

  <p>Under such circumstances, it would be quite tricky to snatch the bone spear so the cyan dragon could devour it.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was contemplating on an efficient attack, Jacques launched his offensive against Luo Zheng. The fighter gently put the bone spear on the ring, as it was being infused with his life vitality continuously. Glancing at his foe, Jacques sneered.</p>

  <p>"Supreme dragon power!" he shouted to announce the movement he was about to make.</p>

  <p>Though a nonliving object, the bone spear was still made from a dragon's spine. The formidable power of the dragon blood hidden inside it suddenly increased by a hundred times shortly after it was stimulated by Jacques' life vitality!</p>

  <p>"All dragons are created to be formidable!</p>

  <p>It is the fate of thousands of creatures to end up prostrating themselves before the feet of dragons. I suggest that you prostrate yourself before me!" It was with a faint smile that he confidently made this declaration.</p>

  <p>A moment ago, Luo Zheng drove him out of the ring with such a strong force that embarrassed him in front of so many people. In fact, it cost him far more than shame. Therefore, he wanted not only to win this competition but also to humiliate Luo Zheng in equal measure.</p>

  <p>After the formidable dragon blood power activated by Jacques' life vitality was suddenly released, it flowed towards Luo Zheng without warning, like a tsunami with enough power that could topple mountains and overturn seas!</p>

  <p>In fact, such daunting power of the dragon race was very similar to the momentum of a human race. The top-grade power of the human race, like Kenneth's power alone, was enough to weaken the stamina of the hands and feet of an ordinary person, and even made him drop to his knees.</p>

  <p>Compared to human race, the dragon race's power was more terrifying, and sharper.</p>

  <p>Ninety percent of the power was pouring itself into Luo Zheng, while the remainder was headed to places around the battle ring.</p>

  <p>When disciples from each peak sensed the horrendous pressure coming from such power, everyone's face turned dreadfully pale, and disciples with lower cultivation base looked as if they were standing on ice and snow, teeth chattering from the cold, and making loud noises.</p>

  <p>'Poof!' came the sound of a body collapsing.</p>

  <p>One disciple, without any warning, fainted and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Casting a glance at Elder Xu, Kenneth said, "I seem to have witnessed too many of the unexpected in this year's All Peaks Competition. This time, unexpectedly, Jacques could even get the spine of a flood dragon."</p>

  <p>The spine of a flood dragon could be used to forge weapons and refine pills. After taking this pill, a person's body would be reborn with a trace of the flood dragon's blood!</p>

  <p>Such a valuable treasure would arouse even Kenneth's interest.</p>

  <p>Of course, because of who he was, Kenneth naturally would never do anything such as stealing Jacques' bone spear.</p>

  <p>"Three years ago, I said that Jacques was a man of great luck. As he develops further, he may be able to get more chances and draw even more good luck. I'm afraid this time Luo Zheng might be defeated," Elder Xu commented.</p>
