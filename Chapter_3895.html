  <p>
</p>

  <p>'This guy is really...'</p>

  <p>Fuxi sighed silently with profound resignation.</p>

  <p>Initially, while he was at the bottom of the chaos, he was honestly not convinced that Gerald had chosen Luo Zheng. However, now it seemed that Gerald had a foresight.</p>

  <p>He then realized that Luo Zheng was indeed the person that they could rely on, and was also the most suitable person to complete the Finale Way in this round of chaos.</p>

  <p>The news that Claire and the Grandmaster of Heaven fought for Luo Zheng in the Grand Plain Stage had been spread to the Li Shan mountain. The two top masters on the Other Shore might have already expected this.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Zheng's magical bloodline was still beyond everyone's expectations.</p>

  <p>While Fuxi was lost in thought, the Snake Goddess's eyes flashed. "Eh?"</p>

  <p>In that moment, she sensed a strong space fluctuation in the distance. She felt as though the fluctuation contained a familiar aura and full vitality.</p>

  <p>She then gracefully stretched out two fingers. From there, two strands of crimson energy rubbed against each other and produced a violent reaction.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the formed energy let out a sharp scream, which could be transmitted far away in the space channel.</p>

  <p>The fluctuation in the distance suddenly stopped and swiftly approached the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>Soon, an unexpected visitor appeared in the space channel. It was the Chaos Ancient God, Gerald.</p>

  <p>Previously, he was trapped by the strange black fire released by the Grandmaster of Heaven. The black fire could hardly be put out, so it took a lot of time for him to completely extinguish it.</p>

  <p>After successfully putting out the black fire, he hurriedly dashed forward to catch up.</p>

  <p>However, after the fierce battle between the Grandmaster of Heaven and Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, the group had already been far away from him.</p>

  <p>Gerald continued to travel through several large provinces and unexpectedly met the Snake Goddess and the other two here.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?"</p>

  <p>After taking a look at the Snake Goddess and Fuxi, he turned to look at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was most concerned about Luo Zheng. The sincerity was reflected in his tone as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Yeah," the Snake Goddess replied. "While the Grandmaster of Heaven was fighting with Othniel, we took the opportunity to escape."</p>

  <p>"What happened?" Gerald asked worriedly. What he just heard had him stunned.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess then told Gerald about the fact that Luo Zheng had released Othniel. The latter was so shocked upon hearing this revelation that he could not help but let out several cries in disbelief.</p>

  <p>"However, we can't stay here for too long. If the two of them figure it out, I'm afraid they will stop fighting and start to head out for us," Gerald said quietly.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Grandmaster of Heaven, Othniel, and Claire fought for the same reason. They all wanted to kill each other and get Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>All they wanted starting from the very beginning was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The fight between the Grandmaster of Heaven and Othniel was meaningless other than for the purpose of getting revenge.</p>

  <p>"You're right. We can't stay here for too long," the Snake Goddess said with a nod.</p>

  <p>"Come on."</p>

  <p>Just as he spoke, Gerald grew to several times bigger than before, like a massive ship floating in front of the three people.</p>

  <p>The three skillfully jumped onto Gerald's back, and Gerald sped along the space channel at high speed.</p>

  <p>Although Gerald was not like Othniel who could control the space truth, he was better than the Snake Goddess and Fuxi in terms of speed.</p>

  <p>Standing on Gerald's back, Fuxi sighed. Gerald had always been arrogant, but now surprisingly, he was willing to carry them on his back, all thanks to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! The air let out a sound as they dashed swiftly.</p>

  <p>They headed west for the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>After passing two provinces in a row, they were finally able to enter the Victory Province, through which they would arrive in the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>As soon as they entered the Victory Province, they saw a golden light flash by the mountain range in the distance. Then, a bolt of golden lightning as thick as a bucket swept upward.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a powerful sound shook the whole area. Boom! The sound echoed and shook the ground slightly.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that some people were fighting in the mountain, creating the booming sound.</p>

  <p>They might be at the Holy Soul Realm at least.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heard from the Snake Goddess that after the flying ships of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were broken, the elites of the palace could not do anything but walk towards the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>It was very likely that the people who were fighting were from the palace.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and have a look,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said before leaping towards the sound's direction. In a flash, Luo Zheng's figure was up in the air and reached the top of the mountain.</p>

  <p>A huge crack, as deep as a hundred thousand feet, was formed in the middle of the mountain.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the crack, Concubine Yan carried the red crystal which contained Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Her black hair was disheveled and her clothes were dirty and ripped. She was no longer as elegant and dignified as before.</p>

  <p>Beside her stood Qiu Yinhe, Goran and Pearce, each holding a sharp and glimmering sword.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was gone. For now, their top priority was to send Eastern Emperor Taiyi to the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Finally, they had already arrived in the Victory Province. They were exhausted and catching their breath. They had never expected that they would be hunted down by the Bearing race on the way.</p>

  <p>Above the crack stood the Five-element Emissaries of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>During the fierce battle just now, two of the Five-element Emissaries were injured by Pearce. Because of this, they didn't dare to attack by force for the time being. Instead, they continued to display their theurgies above the crack.</p>

  <p>The golden lightning that appeared earlier was the Golden Toad Lightning released by the Metal Emissary.</p>

  <p>After releasing the Golden Toad Lightning, the Metal Emissary spoke in a sharp voice, "No matter what, you're all dead. Why don't you hand over Eastern Emperor Taiyi? If you do so, we can still let you go."</p>

  <p>This time, the Bearing race, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race all came out, and they had suffered a great defeat.</p>

  <p>The Divine Farmer fled with the Xuanyuan's broken body, and the remaining members scattered in different directions.</p>

  <p>The Five-element Emissaries were the elites of the Bearing race, and their status was only second to that of the Xuanyuan. It was difficult for them to accept such a crushing defeat, but as they were unable to join the battle for Luo Zheng, they then just aimed their attacks at Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Ying.</p>

  <p>They were divided into two groups. The Holy Soul Realm masters of the New Moon race and the Divine Farmer race were responsible for chasing after Ying, while the Five-element Emissaries were responsible for chasing after Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>They chased desperately all the way and finally caught up with Pearce and his group in the Victory Province.</p>

  <p>As they joined hands with each other, their strength doubled and they were able to block the way of Pearce and the others below. If it weren't for the fact that they were afraid of the mysterious swordsmanship theurgies of Pearce and Goran, they would have already killed them.</p>

  <p>Standing behind Concubine Yan, Feng Ge looked up at the five people in the sky.</p>

  <p>She was frowning and was confused. She didn't expect the situation to change so fast.</p>

  <p>The day Luo Zheng was trapped in the Eternal Scroll Painting, all the people of the Taiyi Heaven Palace began to flee, but they were still unable to escape this chaos.</p>

  <p>If Eastern Emperor Taiyi died, the Taiyi Heaven Palace would completely disappear in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Feng Ge couldn't fathom what was happening. It was as if she were dreaming.</p>

  <p>"Let us go? Huh. Do you think I'm a fool?" Pearce's cold voice floated up along the crack. He scoffed as he finished his sentence.</p>

  <p>He had decided to fight until his last breath. There was no uncertainty in his tone or his expression.</p>

  <p>Besides, even if he retreated, he would surely die. It was then better to take this opportunity and fight head on.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! If you keep wasting time like this, you won't be able to escape death in the end. Why don't you just do as I say?"</p>

  <p>Realizing that they wouldn't surrender, the Metal Emissary laughed wildly.</p>

  <p>Then, another Golden Toad Lightning as thick as a bucket smashed down powerfully.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Explosive sounds covered the whole area once again.</p>

  <p>The surroundings were chaotic. Broken stones flew and dust filled the air, making it difficult to see.</p>

  <p>Pearce, Qiu Yinhe and the others tried their best to defend themselves, but in the end, they still failed. Just as what the Metal Emissary said, they would die at the bottom of the crack sooner or later.</p>

  <p>"Let's fight them to death!"</p>

  <p>"Lady Concubine Yan, run away with Eastern Emperor Taiyi and Princess Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>I'll pin them down!"</p>

  <p>"Even if I die, I will die fighting and they shall die with me!"</p>

  <p>Determination was written all over the faces of Pearce, Qiu Yinhe, and Goran. They still had a way to win, and that was to burn their Other Shore Tokens.</p>
