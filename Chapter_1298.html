<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1298 The Vitality Pressure </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Only after a breakthrough to the Soul Sea Realm could one ascend to the Upper World. This had almost become the law of the universe.</p>

  <p>The warriors in the Ascending Well were all at the Soul Sea Realm, but what was a Life and Death Realm warrior doing here?</p>

  <p>When the woman dressed in plain clothes had talked about ascending to a foreign race, she had been quietly paying attention to Luo Luo Zheng, for she had sensed that he was the calmest of the lot even though he was only at the Life and Death Realm. Luo Luo Zheng wasn't pretending to be poised though; it was his usual state. He kept composure at all times, which implied that his warrior spirit was very stable.</p>

  <p>It was true that the rest of the warriors were at the Soul Sea Realm. So far, their warrior spirits had withstood the ravages of time and danger.</p>

  <p>However, it was still difficult for them to keep poised as Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Which was why the woman in plain clothes was all the more curious about Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The water in this square well is comfortable, but it is not appropriate for us to keep soaking in it like this! Let's get out fast!" one of the warriors voiced out.</p>

  <p>This suggestion was immediately echoed by the others. One of them swam to the well's surface, floating toward its mouth.</p>

  <p>However, just when the warrior was halfway, a muffled sound escaped him. It was as if his head had hit an invisible wall. All of a sudden, he fell back into the well.</p>

  <p>"What is going on?"</p>

  <p>"There seems to be a transparent door at the top."</p>

  <p>The others were befuddled and wanted to know what had happened.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shot an indifferent glance toward the top of the square well before leaping up himself and reaching out to touch the void.</p>

  <p>Sure enough, there was an invisible enchanted barrier at the opening of well. If one wished to break through, one had to unfasten this enchanted barrier first...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was confident in his own strength, but he didn't dare act on it. He was unfamiliar with this place, so it was better not to act rashly for now.</p>

  <p>Although he wasn't afraid of trouble, he didn't want to cause mayhem for no reason either.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Sinking back into the water of the well, Luo Luo Zheng said faintly, "There is indeed an enchanted barrier above. It must have been set up by someone else."</p>

  <p>The warriors in the well nodded at this. They looked at Luo Luo Zheng curiously, the bearded warrior becoming more and more curious as he stared.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he laughed. "You are only at the Life and Death Realm, so how did you ascend here? There is something entirely wrong with this picture."</p>

  <p>"That's right. You're just a Life and Death Realm warrior, but you can ascend to the Upper World! I've never heard of such a thing before!"</p>

  <p>"I was thinking that I was the weakest among this lot when I flew to the Upper World because I have only just created the Soul Sea. Never thought to find a Life and Death Realm warrior here!"</p>

  <p>The trace of disdain was evident in their talk.</p>

  <p>After all, they were all powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm. They understandably looked down upon Life and Death Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Only the woman in plain clothes did not show contempt toward Luo Luo Zheng. As a Life and Death Realm warrior, he had flown into the Upper World and already broken the rules of ascension. He was someone to watch out for.</p>

  <p>If she was correct, Luo Zheng's actual strength certainly surpassed the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression remained indifferent as he listened to them. He stretched his arms and legs and tried his best to let his entire body remain in contact with the water in the well.</p>

  <p>They soaked in the well for half a month. During this time, they became well acquainted with boredom. Moreover, the enchanted barrier above isolated the energy between heaven and earth. When they cultivated, they could only replenish their life vitality with the help of the supreme life vitality crystals that they carried with them.</p>

  <p>It was about half a month later that they suddenly heard a clamor of footsteps.</p>

  <p>A short while later, an armored warrior came to stand by the side of the square well, observing the group of people below with a bored expression on his face. "Seemingly they have been washing themselves for over half a month! I wonder if these disgusting warriors from the Lower World have scoured themselves clean by now!"</p>

  <p>This statement drove the warriors in the well up the wall.</p>

  <p>It was true that they came from the Lower World, but they were also the top warriors there. They demanded respect! Some of them occupied high positions and were comparable to divine kingdom emperors. Countless living beings of the divine kingdoms admired and worshipped them, so how could they endure such an insult?</p>

  <p>A hero should be respected by others no matter where he came from.</p>

  <p>How could they stand being confronted with scorn?</p>

  <p>The warriors in the well were enraged and glared daggers at the armored warrior at the top of the well. They were trapped in the well, so they could do nothing at the moment. It was best that they tried to hold back their anger.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled as he looked on casually. It seemed that this supreme world was similar to the Lower World. There was no lack of such warriors.</p>

  <p>The armored warrior above the square well could sense the angry gazes from below and chuckled. "I know you are indignant now, but if you don't wash your flesh with the purification water, I'm afraid you would be unable to bear the violent vitality between heaven and earth once you leave this well! Do you think our supreme world is the same as your small one?"</p>

  <p>"The violent vitality between heaven and earth? What does that even mean?" The warriors looked at each other with dismay.</p>

  <p>That armored warrior boomed with laughter. "You've already been soaking in the well for half a month. It is about time now. I will let you feel it!"</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, the armored warrior removed the enchanted barrier above the well with a flick of his hand.</p>

  <p>The moment he undid the barrier, the warriors below felt a violent, chaotic force sweep over them from above the well.</p>

  <p>They were shocked. As this violent power was released, it seemed to suppress them with an invisible pressure, making them fidget and squirm with discomfort.</p>

  <p>"How is this vitality between heaven and earth so strong?"</p>

  <p>"It can even activate my cinnabar field..."</p>

  <p>"My life vitality sea has set off a storm!"</p>

  <p>Even the woman in plain clothes, who previously thought herself knowledgeable about the Upper World, was visibly upset.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm warriors were discovering that their life vitality seas reacted violently with the frenzied vitality between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>The sea water that their life vitality created was stirring up strange waves, as if their inner worlds were rolling over. It was acutely troubling.</p>

  <p>Some of the warriors who could not withstand this pressure realized that only the well water could protect them. As their bodies fumbled and sank in, they instantly felt better.</p>

  <p>"The vitality between heaven and earth is wild and violent," Luo Luo Zheng spoke to himself, feeling the abnormal sensations.</p>

  <p>The vitality between heaven and earth was prevalent in the universe, but in this supreme world it was drastically different from that in his original world. If the vitality between heaven and earth in the great world could be likened to a docile sheep, then in this supreme world, it was like a fierce tiger or leopard.</p>

  <p>However, even if the vitality was frantic and violent, it could not have much of an impact on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The reason for it was that there was not a single trace of life vitality in his body. After practicing the Primal Chaos Technique, Luo Zheng's cinnabar field had undergone a tremendous change. There was only the chaotic energy present within it which could not be activated by this frantic vitality between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm strangely.</p>

  <p>"The vitality between heaven and earth is manic and difficult to tame and absorb. But should these warriors truly react like this?" he asked the cyan dragon. The Soul Sea Realm warriors could not tolerate this vitality between heaven and earth. Then what about the other warriors in the supreme world?</p>

  <p>The resources in the supreme world were abundant, but not all warriors were at the Soul Sea Realm. There would be countless mortals, nature creatures, and others at the Illuminating Soul Realm...</p>

  <p>If even the Soul Sea Realm warriors could not bear it, how did the nature creatures survive?</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon's smile flickered in Luo Zheng's mind. "There is nothing strange about it. The reason for it is simple. For fish living in the deep sea, it is difficult to survive in the shallow waters. If we force them out of the deep waves, I'm afraid their bodies would explode and then die."</p>

  <p>"I know. That is because of the water pressure there," Luo Luo Zheng said, nodding.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the vitality between heaven and earth can also cause this because of the Vitality Pressure. These warriors might be at the Soul Sea Realm, but they require an adjustment period to adapt to this new environment.</p>

  <p>After this short time, they won't feel so uncomfortable," the cyan dragon replied.</p>

  <p>"But when I went to the Genuine Dragon World, I didn't feel this kind of Vitality Pressure," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Not only had Luo Luo Zheng been to the Genuine Dragon World, he had been to the Purple Power World as well. Ning Yudie and Mu Ning had also entered it, but they did not feel anything strange.</p>
