<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2192 The End Of The Big Test (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sixty-seven proving godly warriors here, in this wondrous courtyard, were the lucky ones that had passed this year's Heavenly Han House test.</p>

  <p>A handful of them, such as Zane and Seth, had been acknowledged by the Godly Way Tablets on the very first day that they entered the Consulting God Hall. They had easily been waiting here for six days now.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sat upright on a large stone beside a rockery, his eyes closed as he attempted to recuperate his strength as best he could.</p>

  <p>As it was, his soul was currently in a deep slumber, and this was the 'Soul Recovery Technique' that Master Evil had taught him. The cultivation methods that Master Evil practiced were nothing extraordinary, nor did they have any special origins. But someone like Master Evil, who had learned martial arts in his own way, indeed had a few practical methods to share.</p>

  <p>The Soul Recovery Technique for one, was a technique that allowed one to reserve a little soul power in order to maintain a minimum of vigilance, while the soul fell into a deep slumber. This way, one would be capable of recovering their soul power more rapidly within a shorter period of time.</p>

  <p>Throughout the past few days though, Luo Luo Zheng had simply felt too tired. He needed to have a good rest in order to better replenish the soul force that he had consumed.</p>

  <p>As for the other proving godly warriors, they gathered in groups of twos or threes. Most of them wore very excited expressions, as if they were very surprised that they managed to pass Heavenly Han House's test. It was only natural for them to feel such joy.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until the very last moment, on the seventh day in the Consulting God Hall, that May received the acknowledgement of the Godly Way Tablet she had cultivated and successfully passed the Heavenly Han House test. Eric, who had had a conflict with Luo Luo Zheng in the past, equally succeeded the test on the fifth day.</p>

  <p>After leaving everyone to wait in the courtyard for a day, the Heavenly Han House arranged a place for each one of them to stay as well as a few basic living materials. From this day forward, in certain ways, they had become members of the Heavenly Han House. They could cultivate here as well as listen to the True Gods' teachings at will daily.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who had quickly settled down in his residence, continued his exploration of the internal momentum of Divine Dao that he had absorbed.</p>

  <p>Sitting upright on the ground, a strand of purple mist began floating out of his palms, following a light pat of his hands.</p>

  <p>The purple mist split into many paths that were only partly visible. These paths randomly formed their own unique arrangements. According to the arrangements of such paths, one could create a few mysterious arrays.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique itself is an embodiment of the laws.</p>

  <p>It can be used to create sword arrays. No wonder Mu Ning is capable of grasping the Gods Killing Sword Array," Luo Luo Zheng said faintly. After comprehending the internal momentum, Luo Luo Zheng could use the Grand Purple Mu Ning Technique as he pleased.</p>

  <p>Following such, Luo Luo Zheng lightly clapped his hands, and the purple mist turned into a purple-cyan wyvern. The wyvern prostrated onto his fingers and lowered its body. With a light flick of his fingers, the wyvern flew outward, circled around the room, and returned to the form of purple mist before returning to Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>"This ruler is simply unreasonable. I have roamed the divine land for many years and have never heard of such a divine object. Even a first-rank supreme primordial weapon doesn't have an ability extreme enough to hold three thousand Divine Dao. Just what the hell is this thing?" asked Master Evil.</p>

  <p>Over the past few days, Master Evil had witnessed the Infinity Ruler's entire process of absorbing the Divine Dao. Every time the Infinity Ruler was activated, Luo Luo Zheng would always consume the internal momentum into his mind, which equally posed a threat to Master Evil's remnant soul. In the end though, Master Evil was left with no other choice but to sit back quietly in a corner and watch the scene as it played out.</p>

  <p>All he could do was watch as the internal momentum of the Divine Dao was continuously absorbed, transforming into tiny marks on the Infinity Ruler?</p>

  <p>Having lived in the divine land for so long, Master Evil was quite experienced, and he had long heard of certain powerful treasures across the divine land. Those treasures were all in the hands of the Holy Beings of the divine land, though. The Holy Emperor of the Han Clan had a 'Sky Killing Blade', which was an extremely rare supreme primordial weapon, but it was impossible for it to possess such outrageous abilities. If Luo Luo Zheng was given the chance to observe all the three thousand Divine Dao, wouldn't he be able to master all of them?</p>

  <p>As the voice of Master Evil faded away from his mind, the purple mist in Luo Zheng's hand began to dissipate and once again condensed itself into traces of a grayish-white internal momentum.</p>

  <p>The streams of greyish-white internal momentum quickly condensed into a small, round shield. A large number of hexagonal patterns appeared on the surface of the shield, making it resemble a tortoise shell. This was a technique used to protect one's body from the Tortoise Godly Way.</p>

  <p>While Luo Luo Zheng was continuously experimenting with his newfound techniques, a voice came from outside. "Tianxing, the house master wants to meet you," it said.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the voice from a short distance away, Luo Luo Zheng jumped up from the ground. With a flip of his palm, the tortoise shell instantly disappeared, and a profound look appeared in his eyes. He wondered what the hell Malloy wanted to say to him.</p>
