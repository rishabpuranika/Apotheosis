<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If one didn't understand the Space Law, he would be instantly torn apart by the space cracks. Perhaps even a sacred weapon would be ineffective against their power.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's physical body was incomparably strong. His immortal body was equivalent to a fairy weapon, and he was probably the only one in the entire universe to be that way. However, despite possessing so strong a physical body, he would undoubtedly be ripped to shreds if he got sucked into the space cracks.</p>

  <p>Still, the moment the space cracks rolled toward Luo Luo Zheng, his eyes lit up. As quickly as a wink, the mysterious power of the Space Law lunged out and tightly wrapped about him.</p>

  <p>A strange thing happened then.</p>

  <p>The space cracks which could slice through a sacred weapon easily could not hurt Luo Zheng's body. After the cracks had rolled over, his body looked to be floating over their surface. He was unhurt, safe and sound.</p>

  <p>After comprehending the second level of the Space Law, one could create space cracks as he wished, using them as his own weapon. But if one wanted to create space cracks, he had to adapt to them first.</p>

  <p>Space cracks spread out around Luo Luo Zheng. After his body was sucked into a space crack, he appeared on the other side of the space crack. At the moment, his body seemed to have turned into a small boat floating on the surface of water. The space cracks were like waves. Whenever they rolled over, Luo Luo Zheng floated up and down. Not the tiniest bit of damage was done to him.</p>

  <p>As wave after wave thrashed against him, Luo Luo Zheng freely roamed above the cracks.</p>

  <p>Not only that, he continued to study the space cracks and the essence of space during this process. Although it was considerably slower than comprehending on the stone, it was still faster than most common methods.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng's name continued to appear on the wall outside.</p>

  <p>His name had already been placed in the sixth row, the same as in the case of Olivia. Suddenly, his name began to rise through.</p>

  <p>"The fifth row!"</p>

  <p>"The fourth row!"</p>

  <p>Amidst the screams of the crowd, his name soared like a rocket, finally being placed in the fourth row. A few moments later, his name was in the same row as Boris and Cheryl.</p>

  <p>Olivia let out a long sigh of relief. No matter what the consequences, the human race finally had a genius that could rival the ogres and the Demon Night. Past experience told her that as long as Luo Luo Zheng was alive, he would be able to secure a seat for them.</p>

  <p>However, the worries of Olivia and the others were not dispelled. Before all of this, the ogres had already figured out that Luo Luo Zheng was a great threat to them and that he must be eliminated. Now that Luo Zheng's talent had been fully exposed, the ogres would probably try to kill him at the first opportunity.</p>

  <p>Olivia also understood that the Purple Heart Sacred Place would not let Luo Luo Zheng go so easily. After his talent was tested, the power inside the Purple Heart Sacred Place would spare no effort in protecting Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Besides, the tests of the Talent Tablet were not over yet. It was highly likely that Luo Zheng's name would continue to ascend.</p>

  <p>At the moment, a martial artist in cyan robes walked over to the humans.</p>

  <p>"Elder Jing," Olivia, Dylon, and a few other human war generals cupped their hands and greeted him.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing gave them a slight nod. When his gaze landed on Luo Zheng's name, his reserved gaze flashed. "Is he already in the fourth row?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is. I believe he will rise even more," Olivia answered confidently.</p>

  <p>The truth was that jumping up a row was rare and difficult. Talents such as Boris and Cheryl, as long as they didn't die, were sure to obtain a seat at the top of the tower in the future. If they continued to grow and strengthen themselves, they would be able to break through the Soul Sea Realm and come to be the backbone of their sacred places.</p>

  <p>However, Amber was different. A genius in the second row, Amber had started a new era for the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Amber's record was set two hundred years ago, and now he was over two hundred years old. As a cultivator of the martial arts, he was in the prime of his life and had become the strongest warrior on the Sea God Continent at such a shockingly young age. This wasn't just a legend, but a true event that occurred two hundred years ago.</p>

  <p>Except for Amber had reached the second row about two hundred years ago, no one else had successfully secured a seat in the third row. On the whole, a seat in the third row was enough to ensure the status of a certain leader from the sacred place.</p>

  <p>Of course, talent was not everything. It was just an estimate of a martial artist's achievements in the future. To grow up and become stronger, a warrior needed something greater than talent. He needed luck and ample room to grow in a bid to become an influential warrior.</p>

  <p>Every step up, there were rifts and fissures to cross. Yet Olivia was so confident in Luo Zheng's abilities and power that her blind faith in him was overwhelming.</p>

  <p>However, it wasn't just Olivia that Luo Luo Zheng had given such an impression to.</p>

  <p>The warriors and creatures of other races felt the same.</p>

  <p>Even Dylon, who was understandably jealous of Luo Luo Zheng, believed Olivia when she said that Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't stop at the fourth row.</p>

  <p>Elder Jing nodded. Luo Luo Zheng was the reason he had come down from the upper floors today. No matter what the result was, he had to report it immediately.</p>

  <p>Inside the room, ripples from the space cracks gradually subsided, and Luo Luo Zheng was once again engulfed in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Is it over yet?" Luo Luo Zheng had no idea of the situation outside, nor did he know of the full procedures of this test. He was unsure as to whether or not it had ended.</p>

  <p>The darkness only lasted for a few seconds before a gentle glow unrolled around him. Clearly, another round of tests was about to begin.</p>

  <p>Inside this space, he had nobody to answer his questions. He could only grapple with problems by himself and handle the unexpected events calmly and patiently.</p>

  <p>When the seemingly gentle lights showed up, Luo Luo Zheng felt an irresistible force being exerted on his body.</p>

  <p>"What does this mean?"</p>

  <p>The force did not originate from a specific direction, but it was constantly being pressed on to him from all directions. Slowly, his body even floated up, being held up in the air by this force!</p>

  <p>"Such a strong power!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng struggled in vain. The power was too strong for him to withstand.</p>

  <p>When he was unable to break free using his physical strength alone, he attempted to summon the forceful energy within his body. But the moment he made it flow, it disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wondered out loud, now panicking a bit.</p>

  <p>He wasn't so afraid of a dangerous or formidable opponent. However, the loss of his own strength raised his hackles.</p>

  <p>When his forceful energy failed to flow, he began to circulate his life vitality. Although the life vitality was inferior to the forceful energy in strength, it could last longer.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, he found his life vitality also useless to him. Luo Zheng's face was white with shock.</p>

  <p>"This ? How is this even possible?" he murmured to himself, struggling to come up with ways to defeat this unexpected foe.</p>

  <p>"Dragon Scale Power!"</p>

  <p>That didn't work either.</p>

  <p>Other kinds of strengths were of no use to Luo Luo Zheng, except the strength of his physical body.</p>

  <p>It took him aback.</p>

  <p>Frowning, Luo Luo Zheng wondered if this was to test the determination and strength of his physical body, for this force had blocked all of his other strengths.</p>

  <p>In this aggravating situation, he felt relieved and reassured knowing that the Talent Tablet couldn't be controlled by the ogres. Even at a time when ogres wholly seized the Tower of Sin, they weren't masters of the Talent Tower.</p>

  <p>Perhaps no living being in the Lower World could control the giant tower.</p>

  <p>This was nothing more than a test of his talent. Although the pressure on his body increased bit by bit, it didn't aim at crushing him, only at appraising the capabilities of his physical body.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng mused on the purpose of this test, the pressure on his body grew increasingly stronger.</p>

  <p>Under such pressure, even an iron ball would be flattened into a sheet of iron. What was the strength of the physical body of a human being compared to that?</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's body was more resilient than common iron. It was equivalent to a top-grade fairy weapon and had already surpassed the limits of human beings. His bones were several times harder than iron and steel. It wasn't easy to crush them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng continued to bear the heavy pressure as the sound of something snapping resounded from his bones. The gaps between his bones were being constantly compressed, which was why they expelled such a noise when they clashed against each other.</p>

  <p>Under the progressively growing pressure, Luo Luo Zheng bore the brunt of the limits of his physical body.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid... No, this power is too terrifying. It feels like that even a common war lord couldn't wield such a formidable strength."</p>

  <p>If the pressure persisted, Luo Zheng's body would collapse. Suddenly, the gentle light disappeared quietly, leaving Luo Luo Zheng to land on the ground with a loud thud.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the outer wall, Luo Zheng's name disappeared and then reappeared on the second row, right beside Amber's.</p>
