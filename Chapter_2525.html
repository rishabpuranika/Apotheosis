<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2525 Absorb </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"These are wild bones with Chiyou's bloodline..." Zheng uttered as he raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>As Zheng had learned from his mother, the Nine Li race was a huge race in the Source World, and there were also many warriors with Chiyou's bloodline.</p>

  <p>The wild bones had been, presumably to say the least, left behind by the mighty masters of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng had no idea what could have happened in the chaos that caused so many bones to scatter here.</p>

  <p>"Seeing as only those who have Chiyou's bloodline can absorb the power within the wild bones, why would someone even buy them?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>He continued, "Could it be that there are also warriors with Chiyou's bloodline here?"</p>

  <p>Zelda nodded her head. "Yes. It has been said that among the powerful warriors on the bone towers, a few of them do have the powerful bloodline!"</p>

  <p>"There are actually people with Chiyou's bloodline here," Zheng stated, almost to himself. His heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>Only the Nine Li people could actually inherit Chiyou's bloodline.</p>

  <p>Was it possible that the Nine Li people also existed among the Out-of-Land Fiends? Or, could they have used other lesser known methods to obtain Chiyou's bloodline?</p>

  <p>If there were really Nine Li people here, they could possibly become one of his strong reinforcements...</p>

  <p>Quite frankly, this was only the thought running through Zheng's mind. He knew he couldn't act rashly before he completely figured out that crucial point.</p>

  <p>"Let's just drop the subject for now. Don't you have a wild bone in your hand? I'll teach you the method for refining it now! Remember, you must keep it in your mind!" Zelda smiled honestly.</p>

  <p>The methods for refining the wild bones were about the same, but not everyone could bear the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>In the Iron Tribe Zelda was from, she was the only one who could bear the power of Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>"The power of a wild bone is owner-less. For this reason, extracting the power from the wild bones isn't difficult. What's truly difficult, is how much you can make use of such power," Zelda said seriously as she faced Zheng, sitting with her legs crossed. In her hands, she too, held a wild bone.</p>

  <p>Luther dug three wild bones out of the Immemorial Wilderness. One of them was given to Zheng in order to repay him for saving his life, and the other two were given to Zelda.</p>

  <p>"The method I use is called the Trickle Spring Method. I learned it from a master when I was still very young," said Zelda. As soon as her hands left the wild bone, the bone floated in front of her with ease.</p>

  <p>Her hands moved around the wild bone as if she was stroking a baby, without really touching it.</p>

  <p>"The key point of the Trickle Spring Method is to control the spiritual will in guiding the power to come out from the wild bone. It has to be slow at the beginning and gradually increase in speed in order to direct the power out from inside the bone... The spiritual will is similar to the force of a spring, causing the water to gush out at a constant speed."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished speaking, Zheng felt a sudden and immediate change in the wild bone.</p>

  <p>The Wild God Power, that had previously been firmly locked within the wild bone moved slightly before surging outward slowly, just like a spring water stream!</p>

  <p>"Ah! So, that's how it is..." Zheng nodded his head slightly in understanding.</p>

  <p>As the Wild God Power came out, it slowly flowed in front of Zelda.</p>

  <p>With a flick of her finger, the streams of Wild God Power began to progressively seep into her body.</p>

  <p>"While absorbing the Wild God Power, you need to pay attention to do it as fast as you possibly can. It's also important that you absorb it into your body in an even manner." Zelda was very proficient in the method she demonstrated. While she was absorbing the Wild God Power, she explained the key points to Zheng.</p>

  <p>A good thirty seconds later, Zelda had finished absorbing the totality of the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>After absorbing it all however, Zheng discovered that a little Wild God Power constantly escaped from her body.</p>

  <p>"These streams of Wild God Power... Why are they escaping from your body?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Zelda took this for granted and replied helplessly, "This is what I was telling you about - the difficulty of this method - and how much you can make actual use of it. I can only absorb thirty percent of the Wild God Power. For the remaining seventy percent, because I can't lock it into my body, it will ultimately be wasted."</p>

  <p>In fact, any warrior that cultivated the Wild God Power would encounter the same problem.</p>

  <p>"Only thirty percent?" Zheng did never expect that such a high percentage of Wild God Power from the wild bone would go to waste. "Let me give it a try!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you'll waste this entire piece of precious bone the first time you give this method a try," Luther added, who was still standing beside them.</p>

  <p>Wild bones were too rare for them to waste completely. The other felt that Zheng was in quite a rush to absorb the Wild God Power, seeing as he had only watched Zelda demonstrate it once.</p>

  <p>However, Zelda said, "It doesn't matter. I've wasted almost all the Wild God Power of a wild bone on my first attempt. One can only succeed by trying it out for themselves."</p>

  <p>A smile curled at the corners of Zheng's lips and he gently tossed the wild bone in his hand into the air.</p>

  <p>The wild bone slowly rotated in front of him, and simultaneously, he extracted the power from it according to the Trickle Spring Method that Zelda had taught him just moments ago.</p>

  <p>Clearly, this method was too easy for Zheng.</p>

  <p>As his fingers gently waved around the hovering bone, streams of Wild God Power were drawn out of it like threads reeling from cocoons! Zelda and Luther couldn't help but have the looks of amazement etched on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Zheng! How did you... How did you do it so quickly?" Zelda took a deep breath. Her eyes were wide open in shock.</p>

  <p>When Zelda performed the method with her skillful techniques, the Wild God Power that had been extracted poured out like water gushing from a spring.</p>

  <p>When Zheng used the Trickle Spring Method to extract the Wild God Power, on the other hand, the Wild God Power burst out in the blink of an eye. Furthermore, every last drop of power in the wild bone was extracted by Zheng!</p>

  <p>Be it the Trickle Spring Method or other methods though, they all used spiritual will in order to extract the power from the wild bones.</p>

  <p>Zheng's soul was as strong as that of a consummate True God. Using his spiritual will to extract the Wild God Power was as simple as pie for him.</p>

  <p>After he had finished extracting the Wild God Power, Zheng sucked it directly into his body.</p>

  <p>And following what Zelda had told him, Zheng tried his best to let the Wild God Power distribute itself evenly throughout his body.</p>

  <p>Zelda and Luther stared straight at Zheng. Their breathing was shallow and they couldn't believe their own two eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, simply continued sitting there, doing what he was doing.</p>

  <p>The three of them continued like this for a long time. Suddenly, Zelda, who had a look of completely incomprehension asked, "Where did the Wild God Power go, then?"</p>

  <p>"I have absorbed it," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Why isn't there any Wild God Power escaping from your body?!" she asked bewildered. Zelda was stunned.</p>

  <p>Even after having cultivated the Wild God Power for so long, she could only make use of thirty percent of its power. And this was already a laudable feat. It wasn't anything to be scoffed at.</p>

  <p>It was said that a few geniuses of certain great forces could make use of sixty or even seventy percent of the Wild God Power. But this was rare, and Zelda had never encountered such an individual.</p>

  <p>That said, this was Zheng's first time absorbing the Wild God Power and he'd actually absorbed all of it! What was more, not even a tiny bit of it was leaking out!</p>

  <p>Despite her vast knowledge and experience, Zelda simply couldn't understand what she had just witnessed.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng himself, he only felt a little confused. A brief moment later, he'd understood how he had come to achieve something so unbelievable.</p>

  <p>It was simple. Most creatures' physical bodies weren't flawless. More so, there were always certain loopholes that couldn't be detected. The life vitality one sucked in could leak out through those specific loopholes, and the same went for the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body had been forged so many times that he already possessed a Flawless Divine Body from back when he was in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Once the Wild God Power had entered Zheng's body, escaping it was simply impossible.</p>
