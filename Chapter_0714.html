  <p>
</p>

  <p>Independent cultivators practiced a myriad of cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>Although their rank wasn't high, they often had a hundred tricks up their sleeves!</p>

  <p>For example, Dawson could roam the Central Region without any sect's support, and he had even gone to the Chaotic Ocean of Stars and escaped unscathed. Although he didn't go as far into the Chaotic Ocean of Stars as the experts in the Virtual Tribulation Realm, his progress was rare for a cultivator in the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>In the instant that Dawson dashed forward, a trace of earthy yellow life vitality condensed in front of him and formed a heavy shield that encased him.</p>

  <p>The reason why Dawson was called the Divine Traveller was that he practiced a unique step called the Traceless Snowstep. This step helped him run fast without leaving any trace. After closing in on his opponent through this step, Dawson would launch a series of attacks. He would then be able to wear out his opponent and win!</p>

  <p>This was a common tactic used by Dawson. It had given him miraculous results in many battles before.</p>

  <p>Even though Segar was not well-known, he was still a disciple of the Mysterious Luna Hall. Dawson was confident, but he was not the slightest bit careless and used his full strength the moment he attacked! Cultivating to the Internal Elixir Realm as an independent cultivator required not only talent but also a heart that was adept at seeing the truth.</p>

  <p>With a slightly pale face, Segar looked indifferently at the rapidly approaching Dawson.</p>

  <p>"My master said that blood is necessary for the first battle. This is the only way to keep the audience enchanted. I'm very sorry, but I can only use your blood..." A cruel smile grew on Segar's ordinary-looking face. A few strands of black silk were created as he crossed his fingers and lightly pulled them. In the next instant, the black silk pounced toward Dawson like little snakes.</p>

  <p>Dawson mainly practiced the cultivation method of the earth system, and he excelled in defense. That layer of earthen yellow life vitality shield had an astonishing defensive power. Normal attacks simply weren't able to tear it apart. However, the black silk in Segar's hands went through the life vitality shield easily and entwined around Dawson's body.</p>

  <p>His arms, abdomen, head, and legs were all enveloped by the black threads.</p>

  <p>Segar's face revealed the brightest smile. At the same time, his voice became louder. "Bloom!" Segar crossed his hands and pulled the threads with force.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>As the black silk suddenly tightened, scarlet blood spurted out from Dawson's sturdy body.</p>

  <p>Blood droplets sprinkled from his body, forming a chaotic mess of blood stains on the ground. From afar, it looked like a blossoming, blood-red rose.</p>

  <p>After the blood had drained out, Dawson's body fell to the ground in pieces.</p>

  <p>Segar's attack had killed him.</p>

  <p>When they saw such a bloody scene, the several hundred thousand cultivators present fell silent.</p>

  <p>All of the cultivators that came to participate in the Martial Arts Contest knew that the contest was dangerous and they could die. No one had thought that it would happen so quickly. The impact was so strong that even the cruelest cultivators felt extremely uncomfortable seeing this scene.</p>

  <p>Life and death in the arena were determined by fate. The rules of the Martial Arts Contest weren't unfamiliar to the cultivators of the Central Region.</p>

  <p>However, generally speaking, the contestants wouldn't torture and kill each other like that, unless they had deep hatred toward their opponent.</p>

  <p>The crowd of cultivators looked at the ordinary-looking Segar with caution.</p>

  <p>'This disciple from the Mysterious Luna Hall is way too ruthless, ' they thought.</p>

  <p>"Segar from Mysterious Luna Hall wins!" Xiao announced. Then, with a wave of his hand, a member of the World Commercial Alliance came to clear the battle arena.</p>

  <p>The first match had ended within a minute. What impressed those present was not the powerful cultivation methods, nor the monstrous talent, but the bloody scene.</p>

  <p>When Segar returned to the high platform, Elderly Luna nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>"Segar, you did well. I'll give you ten years of freedom."</p>

  <p>Hearing that, Segar's ordinary face revealed a surprised expression, "Thank you, Sir!"</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Luna Hall was a unique sect. Freedom was the most important reward for the disciples of the sect! The Mysterious Luna Hall had strict rules for its disciples. From the first day they entered the Mysterious Luna Hall, they had been implanted with the Death Corpse Spell. This spell was extremely poisonous. A year later, the toxic gas would enter the body of the cultivators, where it would fester. The only result for them was a tragic death.</p>

  <p>Unless the cultivators could break through to the Virtual Tribulation Realm, there was no other way to get rid of the Death Corpse Spell. To prevent the attack of the toxic gas, a Fire Flaming Pill would be given to the disciples of the Mysterious Luna Hall every year. As long as they consumed the Fire Flaming Pill, they would be safe.</p>

  <p>For this reason, the disciples of the Mysterious Luna Hall seldom left the sect. Even if they had to go out on a mission, they needed to return before the Death Corpse Spell was activated.</p>

  <p>Elderly Luna had awarded Segar ten years of freedom. It meant that he planned to give him ten Fire Flaming Pills so that Segar could live carefree for the following ten years.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng frowned when he saw the battle. It was just as Ning Yudie had said.</p>

  <p>Although the rewards for this Martial Arts Contest were great, a cultivator would have to pay with his life if he let down his guard. In comparison, the competition at the sect was gentler as no one would die.</p>

  <p>'Anyway, this is also the only way for me to kill Marilyn Si, ' Luo Luo Zheng reassured himself.</p>

  <p>Not long after, Xiao sent another stream of life vitality toward the jade case.</p>

  <p>"Bam!"</p>

  <p>The jade case spat out two name tags.</p>

  <p>Xiao waved his hand, and the two name tags flew toward him. He saw the name on one of the name tags, and then glanced at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's heart skipped a beat. 'This is the second battle. Is it my turn so soon?' wondered Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Xiao had indeed drawn Luo Zheng's name tag, but he was a bit hesitant. How should he introduce Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>Generally, the disciples who took part in the pre-qualifying match were independent cultivators. Even if they joined a certain sect, they were from grade three sects, or even grade two sects, or came from some small family.</p>

  <p>According to the World Commercial Alliance, those from the sects below the fourth grade were called independent cultivators.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was a disciple from Cloud Hall. So Xiao wasn't sure about how to introduce him. In the end, Xiao sent a message to the leader of the Alliance, Dillon, through his life vitality, asking for his opinion.</p>

  <p>"Read it. Why don't you read the name?"</p>

  <p>"Why the heck are you stalling?"</p>

  <p>"Do they still want to fight? I'd like to see rivers of blood. The battle should be as bloody as possible!"</p>

  <p>After receiving Dillon's instruction, Xiao nodded and then loudly announced, "Luo Luo Zheng from the Cloud Hall will battle against the independent cultivator, Alex Gongsun!"</p>

  <p>"It is my turn!" When Xiao had looked at him, Luo Luo Zheng had guessed this possibility. He hadn't expected that it would be his turn so soon.</p>

  <p>The moment had finally come. Luo Luo Zheng didn't show the slightest hesitance as he strode toward the arena.</p>

  <p>At the same time, another independent cultivator also followed Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When they heard that the next challenger was from Cloud Hall, the cultivators in the audience turned to look at the members from Cloud Hall who were sitting on the high platform. This time, five members from Cloud Hall were participating in the competition. The cultivators were confused as to why those five didn't move when Xiao called out one of their names.</p>

  <p>Instead, two participants walked out from the section where the independent cultivators were seated.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? Why did the disciple of the Cloud Hall come out from that side?"</p>

  <p>"Wait. Are my eyes playing tricks on me? I didn't notice him earlier. Is this brat... at the Illuminating Soul Realm?"</p>

  <p>"He is indeed at the Illuminating Soul Realm... And what's even more surprising is that he is at the fourth grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm!</p>

  <p>The fourth grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm! How did he manage to pass the pre-qualifying match?"</p>

  <p>Cultivators who passed the pre-qualifying match were treated like minor celebrities, just like Alex Gongsun, who was the eldest son of a third-grade family in Oracle City! The Gongsun family had a close relationship with the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he had not been in the Central Region for long. Moreover, he had been cultivating since he entered Cloud Hall. Almost no cultivators had heard of him, except Michael and the other members of the World Commercial Alliance.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had been standing in the middle of the crowd. Everyone's attention had been focused on the large sects, so they hadn't noticed that a cultivator at the Illuminating Soul Realm was among the Internal Elixir Realm cultivators.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng had walked out, he naturally received a lot of attention. His cultivation level seemed to be a bit lower than the other cultivators!</p>
