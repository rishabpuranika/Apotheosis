  <p>
</p>

  <p>The woman was wearing a purple silk robe with exquisite embroidery.</p>

  <p>The ivory white ribbon which decorated her long ebony-colored hair slowly fluttered behind her like a banderole from a masthead, making her look like a fairy from a painting.</p>

  <p>She walked daintily in her crescent-shaped embroidered shoes and explored around the edge of the city wall. With every step she took, a step formed by ice was created on the ground and these supported her light footsteps, permitting her to float forward a distance. The icy steps shattered with a loud bang once she had stepped off from these frozen perches, so every light step she took was accompanied by the clear and melodious sound of ice shattering.</p>

  <p>Crack! Splash!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes were calm as he looked at the purple-clothed woman.</p>

  <p>However, he was on guard, and his four limbs quietly spread out in preparation for anything.</p>

  <p>Cultivation was a standard that measured a warrior's strength. But, in the Upper World, this standard was no longer the most accurate.</p>

  <p>For example, a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm could be far stronger than a normal warrior at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had personally killed Spirit Supreme Realm warriors before, and this situation had not only existed for him. Many powerful warriors throughout the universe, as well as the ace talents of various races could do the same. Cultivation had therefore become somewhat of a moot point now.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng felt this woman's cold and sharp Mu Ning, he also felt that her strength was prodigious. She might even be the strongest warrior he had encountered since he entered the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>"The city lord is here!"</p>

  <p>"Is this woman the lord of this city? She is so beautiful and innocent-looking, like a fairy."</p>

  <p>"Why would it be strange that a girl from the Ji Clan is so beautiful and looks like a fairy?"</p>

  <p>The onlookers discussed it among themselves.</p>

  <p>On top of the city wall, many warriors were enraptured by this woman's appearance, and their eyes began to shine with a radiant light. Only a perfect object could cause these glowing expressions to populate the faces of the warriors.</p>

  <p>The woman in front of them was indeed perfect.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes followed suit and also glowed in admiration. In terms of appearance and demeanor, Xun was probably the only one who could compare to this perfect woman.</p>

  <p>However, her temperament was completely different from Xun's.</p>

  <p>Xun radiated a feeling of supreme nobility, as if she was a goddess which had descended upon this world. Moreover, with every movement, Xun would reveal resolution and killing intent. A fiery heart was hidden within, under her ice-cold exterior, just like a frozen volcano waiting to erupt.</p>

  <p>The woman in front of him, on the other hand, was wrapped in an Mu Ning of serenity and peace.</p>

  <p>Just like the falling snowflakes, her cold Mu Ning didn't make people want to resist her, but made them calm.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng could feel that there was a faint killing intent hidden just beneath the frosted facade. This killing intent was extremely arrogant, as if she had earned the confidence to kill and take the lives of all living beings. And those "living beings" naturally included him.</p>

  <p>The purple-clothed siren was drawing closer and closer to Luo Luo Zheng. The coldness which emanated from her was gaining intensity, and the snowflakes falling from the sky were also increasing in size.</p>

  <p>All of the warriors, both inside and outside the city walls, shut their mouths, and only the patter of snowflakes falling on the ground could be heard.</p>

  <p>The temperature of the Illusion Battlefield wasn't low, and could be said to be scorching hot for mortals. However, these snowflakes didn't melt; they were piling up at a visible rate and soon covered the whole ground in a thin layer like icing on a cake.</p>

  <p>"You killed Ethan?" The purple-clothed woman's gaze landed on Luo Luo Zheng as she moved through the drifting snowflakes. Like her temperament, this woman's gaze was especially pure and penetrating. Luo Luo Zheng felt as if she were looking right into his heart, reading his feelings and thoughts like reading a book.</p>

  <p>"Who is Ethan?" Luo Luo Zheng asked with a smile and raised his head to look at the woman. "Are you referring to that blue-robed warrior?"</p>

  <p>The purple-clothed lady nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"Sort of." Luo Luo Zheng did not deny it. He pointed to the spot where the golden pill had exploded and said, "But he could also have been considered to have committed suicide. On the down side, I didn't get his Illusion Points."</p>

  <p>That blue-robed warrior had in the end committed suicide, yet his Illusion Points had been absorbed by someone else. Until now, Luo Luo Zheng hadn't been able to figure it out; this was simply inconsistent with the rules of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>"Those Illusion Points were naturally absorbed by me, since they were rightfully mine," the purple-clothed woman said indifferently.</p>

  <p>"How did you do it?" Luo Luo Zheng was most curious about this.</p>

  <p>The woman did not show any intention of answering Luo Zheng's question.</p>

  <p>Instead, she continued to examine him with her pure eyes. "You even killed Norton."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Luo Zheng was also a bit speechless. Obviously, this woman wanted to ask something that could have been phrased in a single question. Yet she worked up to her goal as she asked him twice. He just grinned and said, "Yes, I did kill him! You're the city lord, right? Were these two your men?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's words carried a clear tone of provocation. Although he had responded by going on alert when he saw this opponent, he was not afraid of battle.</p>

  <p>The purple-clothed woman did not respond to Luo Zheng's question. She did not seem to take any notice of what he said, but instead completely immersed herself in her own thoughts. Finally, she pronounced, "You have taken half of Norton's Illusion Points. I have to kill you three times to earn those total back. After I kill you three times, I can let you leave the city."</p>

  <p>When he heard these strange words again, Luo Luo Zheng then understood that it was impossible to communicate with this girl.</p>

  <p>But this did not affect Luo Zheng's goal.</p>

  <p>From the looks of it, this woman was indeed the city lord. Killing her to take away her Illusion Points was Luo Zheng's only goal.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword suddenly appeared in Luo Zheng's hand, while a glimmer of light appeared on the blue blade of the sword. Luo Luo Zheng restrained his emotions and held his sword vertically across his chest in salute. "If you can defeat me, then do it. Even thirty times is okay."</p>

  <p>The purple-clothed woman glanced searchingly at Luo Zheng's long sword.</p>

  <p>Although she didn't know the origins of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, she knew that this sword was not ordinary. A sliver of surprise appeared in her clear eyes.</p>

  <p>"The sword is interesting. What's your name?" the purple-clothed woman suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing Luo," said Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The woman's face revealed a trace of disappointment when she heard Luo Zheng's name.</p>

  <p>The number of warriors in the Illusion Battlefield might have reached one trillion by now, and there might even be millions or even tens of millions of warriors with the surname Luo. 'Alas! It's so hard to meet that guy, ' the woman thought bitterly.</p>

  <p>Immediately, she sighed and released a steaming breath into the cold air.</p>

  <p>When she thought about the ends of the stories that Luo Luo Zheng hadn't revealed, her cold heart burned with passion. 'If he has entered the Illusion Battlefield, he would definitely not be some nameless person. I should be able to find him!' As for this man before her, since he had gone against the rules she had set, she would naturally kill him and reap his Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>"Don't call me 'the city lord, '" the purple-dressed woman said, as she slightly spread out her slender fingers, which were as fair as the falling snow. Soon after, a rippling light wrapped around her fingers, weaving in amongst the digits.</p>

  <p>After the light had dissipated, five rings appeared on her fingers.</p>

  <p>The five rings were old and had no decorative design to them. Their ancient design did not match with the temperament of the woman.</p>

  <p>There were also thin chains which linked the five rings. She suddenly stretched out her slender fingers, causing the chains to softly clank against each other as the links began to move.</p>

  <p>Only then did she say, "My name is Lucille Ji. Remember my name, and go to hell."</p>

  <p>The moment she finished speaking, the snowflakes that had slowly been falling around her suddenly increased in speed by more than ten times.</p>

  <p>It had been the type of snow that would have quietly fallen on winter nights, but now it became an epic snowstorm in the middle of winter.</p>

  <p>Hooo...hooo...hooo...</p>

  <p>Not only did the snowflakes get bigger, but the wind also picked up and became stronger.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the swirling snowstorm, Lucille Ji's body suddenly flew towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When she was slowly strolling through the snow, she was an elegant lady. But once she moved onto the battlefield, she became like a bolt of lightning, not at all inferior to a man.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the distance between her and Luo Luo Zheng had narrowed to less than 10 feet.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's long sword also suddenly rang out.</p>

  <p>"Nether God Shadows!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng infused his chaotic energy into the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, a twisting bolt of lightning shot out towards the woman with a sharp electric crackle.</p>

  <p>This lightning was followed by a sharp wind blade.</p>

  <p>After the wind blade, there came numerous Nether God Shadows, each of which displayed a different fist technique in attacking Lucille Ji.</p>

  <p>On top of the city wall, all of the warriors were fixedly staring at the scene before them. They almost held their breaths in anticipation of what they believed was an inevitable outcome.</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors in the city had witnessed or even experienced Lucille Ji's strength at first hand, so they didn't dare to cross over the city wall by even half an inch. This was because they clearly understood that only the rules of the city could protect them.</p>

  <p>"Why do I feel that it's not fair? Has the city lord suddenly become generous, since she only plans to kill this brat three times before letting him go?"</p>

  <p>"The city lord's personality has always been very contrary. She is temperamental, and I've heard that it has something to do with the books she's reading. She seems to be easily influenced by the stories in the books."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes gentle, sometimes brutal... I find this personality type very attractive."</p>

  <p>"Attractive?" "She is an ace talent of the Ji Clan. Do you think you can hold a candle to her?"</p>

  <p>This battle had just begun, and many warriors were also taking advantage of this opportunity to discuss it in whispers.</p>
