<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4083 Return The Energy Souls </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Having dealt with the Snake Spirit Sect for so many years, the Eye Spirit knew very well the kind of temperament the Snake Masters had. And it was nothing good.</p>

  <p>These powerful warriors were known to be capricious and tyrannical.</p>

  <p>In front of any creatures of chaos, they always maintained an innate sense of superiority.</p>

  <p>It was not impossible to negotiate terms with them, but that happened only when they themselves needed something rather urgently.</p>

  <p>To be honest, even the monkeys were not much different from those snakes at this point...</p>

  <p>Even if they were determined to get the wolf teeth, that didn't mean that the Element Spirit race could ask for anything in return, which was why the Eye Spirit had interrupted Claire.</p>

  <p>Manuel turned his head and glanced at the Primeval Lord of Heaven. He then commanded in a curt tone, "Take the humans on the Ghost Altar to the eastern region. All the humans will not be allowed to go out during this period of time!"</p>

  <p>The eastern region was the territory of the human race in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>The guy had basically imprisoned all the humans just with a single sentence.</p>

  <p>"Master Manuel..."</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun was about to say something, but the Primeval Lord of Heaven coughed and interrupted him. He agreed instantly, "Yes, sir!"</p>

  <p>Then he told Fuxi, the Snake Goddess and the others, "You guys, come on up!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, the Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasmin, as well as Campbell, who was at the moment, in the form of a Treacherous Being, leaped up and stood beside the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>And when King Ieuan, the three Eternal Realm Hunters flew up to follow them as well, a powerful force came crashing down on them.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Four muffled thuds were also heard after the large bang.</p>

  <p>The four of them had been smashed down hard on the Ghost Altar.</p>

  <p>And the smashing force was nothing small. After the dust had settled, King Ieuan tried to get up from the ground, but its legs seemed weak and it merely lay on the ground. Blood was gurgling out from the corner of its mouth.</p>

  <p>The three Eternal Realm Hunters were also in a similar situation.</p>

  <p>In fact, several of Thurston's and Sawyer's bones had been broken, and they could hardly even try to stand up. Only Pearson was in an okay-ish shape.</p>

  <p>Looking around, they discovered it was Manuel who had slapped them down.</p>

  <p>The he scolded with a harsh roar, "Just who the hell do you think you are?</p>

  <p>You are not even Great Ghost Priests, and you want to enter the third floor?</p>

  <p>I don't think so!"</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Monkey Masters, the Great Ghost Priests were nothing more than a group of slaves. Their sole job was to obey orders.</p>

  <p>As for warriors from the many races of the Other Shore, they were nothing but a group of walking corpses to the Monkey Masters.</p>

  <p>In retrospect, Manuel had spared their lives only because he didn't care enough to kill them.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, if he had used just a little bit more strength, King Ieuan and the three Eternal Realm Hunters would have become a pile of meat paste.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven sighed in his heart and then explained,</p>

  <p>"Ordinary people are not allowed to enter the third floor of the Ghost Mountain. You can not follow us any further!"</p>

  <p>After wiping the blood from its mouth, King Ieuan once again made an effort to get up from the ground.</p>

  <p>To be honest, it was aware that it might not be a good thing for them to follow the other members of the company.</p>

  <p>Once the wolf teeth really did wake up the Ghost Master, they would all die with the human race.</p>

  <p>However, they had been with Luo Zheng and his group for a long time and they had gone through thick and thin with them. So naturally, they were unwilling to part ways with him.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven did not say anything more. He merely led Luo Zheng and the other humans into the space channel which led to the eastern region, the region where the human race resided.</p>

  <p>Manuel then told the Eye Spirit, "You can come up now. Follow me. It's time to wake up the Ghost Master!"</p>

  <p>The three members of the Element Spirit race, the Eye Spirit, Claire, and Gavyn jumped up and followed the Monkey Masters into the space channel.</p>

  <p>When the Great Ghost Priests had left, the only ones left on the Ghost Altar were the Glede Demon race, the Grand Mighty race, the Red Demon race, the Eternal Realm Hunters and King Ieuan. The last two of the above were busy healing themselves.</p>

  <p>"The situation doesn't seem good, Bacchus," Tate remarked in a long voice.</p>

  <p>He had endured a long time of silence.</p>

  <p>Now that everyone had left, the remaining people could finally speak freely.</p>

  <p>"Those human beings are going to die, and since there is no point in letting you Glede Demon race survive, it is certain that you too will die," Murdock said.</p>

  <p>"The territory of the Glede Demon race will be divided up by our Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race, hahaha..." Tate laughed happily.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Red Demon race had suffered a lot at the hands of the Glede Demon race. Although the two were always involved in some sort of tussle, once the latter was gone, they could get their revenge in the form of occupying their territory.</p>

  <p>Bacchus's face darkened.</p>

  <p>The other three Glede Demons also looked pale at this prospect.</p>

  <p>They often boasted that they were the most powerful race on the Night View Island, but now they were finally going to meet their end!</p>

  <p>At that moment, King Ieuan suddenly spoke up, "It's too early for you to be celebrating."</p>

  <p>Tate glanced at it coldly, "Why do you think so?"</p>

  <p>"It's not that easy to wake up Treacherous Beings," Pearson chimed in as well. "It is not necessary true that those wolf teeth are the obsession of the Ghost Master."</p>

  <p>"Yes." Thurston also nodded. "The Great Ghost Priest of the human race also said that just now. I really don't know why you guys are so confident.</p>

  <p>Never count your chickens before they are hatched!"</p>

  <p>Tate and Murdock of course were aware of this.</p>

  <p>Obsession was a mysterious and unpredictable thing.</p>

  <p>Thurston's and Pearson's remarks gave Bacchus and the Glede Demons a slight glimmer of hope. And just a few feet away from them, members of the Red Demon race and the Grand Mighty race began to worry.</p>

  <p>Far away in the eastern region on the third floor of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>In addition to the four Great Ghost Priests, namely the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Emperor Di Jun, Chiyou, Zhurong, the other heroes of the human race were also residents of this area.</p>

  <p>Over the long years, most of them had chosen to go to secluded places for cultivation. Some of them had been in isolation for millions or even tens of millions of years now...</p>

  <p>Finally, it was today that the Primeval Lord of Heaven called them out one by one.</p>

  <p>The real Fuxi, the real Snake Goddess, the real Gonggong, the real Houyi, the real Buddha, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi...</p>

  <p>They were all very surprised at this summon. It was a rather unusual event.</p>

  <p>The last time he had been here, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had simply collected their bloodlines one by one, which hadn't required him to gather everyone together.</p>

  <p>"Old man, what are you calling us for in such a hurry?" the real Fuxi asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven smiled. "There are some people you may want to meet."</p>

  <p>As he finished his words, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others walked in from behind him.</p>

  <p>When the real human heroes saw these members of Luo Zheng's company, they were all left stunned. The real Snake Goddess was the first to react. "Are these the avatars we sowed a long time ago? Have you succeeded in your mission?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess's eyes flashed with the same light as the real one. "Not yet."</p>

  <p>"How did you find this place?" the real Snake Goddess asked once again.</p>

  <p>It was already an extremely difficult task to enter the Three Purities Stage, and it was even more difficult to find a way into the Night View Island. In fact, the real Snake Goddess had always considered it to be impossible.</p>

  <p>The other human heroes also looked at them in surprise.</p>

  <p>At that time, Luo Zheng, who was standing next to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, spoke up, "It's a long story. The answer lies in the memories of the energy souls that you placed in the Creation Myth Temple."</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, energy souls of those human heroes emerged from the top of his head one after another.</p>

  <p>When they saw their energy souls, their jaws dropped in shock...</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was the first one to ask, "Did you go to the Creation Myth Temple? That book... "</p>

  <p>"I have already carried it," Luo Zheng piped in.</p>

  <p>Whoever carried the Civilization Artifact of the human race could be considered as their leader. This was a rule they had decided to follow since a long time ago and it was still binding.</p>

  <p>The real Snake Goddess nodded. She didn't utter a word. Instead, she just waited for her energy soul to rush into her mind and began to merge with the memories of the energy soul...</p>

  <p>From Stage Seventeen till now, every single memory was drilled into the minds of the real human heroes.</p>

  <p>Through that assimilation process, they came to know Luo Zheng's name, the situation of the Source World, the reason why the passageway to the Night View Island was repaired, and the unfathomable ancestry-level bloodline in Luo Zheng's body!</p>

  <p>The moment the real Snake Goddess found out about the ancestry-level bloodline, she suddenly opened her eyes. She was so shocked that her face turned pale as her gaze turned towards the real Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>However, the latter didn't say anything. Instead, he merely smiled at her in response.</p>

  <p>Just now, he had merged with the memories of his energy soul, and he had had the same expression as the real Snake Goddess. In fact, his expressions had been much more exaggerated than the real Snake Goddess's.</p>
