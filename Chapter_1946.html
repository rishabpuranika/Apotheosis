<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1946 Including Mortals </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng finished speaking, his figure appeared out of the void. He floated above the Sacred warrior's head, looking down.</p>

  <p>He resembled a sovereign with the strong and overbearing Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The Sacred warriors were typically proud of their noble bloodlines. In their eyes, all other races were equal, but beneath them.</p>

  <p>Humans and other intelligent creatures were no different from pigs, dogs, ants, or any other living things.</p>

  <p>Only the Sacred race was regarded different, with characteristics to surpass and even dominate other races.</p>

  <p>In the Murphy Universe, any living being or race could only present themselves before the Sacred warriors, living off of their charity and support.</p>

  <p>The Sacred martial artist had never felt such a kind of strong Mu Ning before.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's inescapable Mu Ning made the martial artist feel comparably small. He had a strong feeling that he was about to be forced into submission.</p>

  <p>But now, he was just facing a human being. Because of the glory in his bloodline, this Sacred martial artist instinctively resisted. How could he submit to a human being so easily?</p>

  <p>"What's your name? Tell me, and I will not harm you." Luo Zheng's cold voice floated out again, as a golden light flickered faintly in his eyes. The warrior's chest pounded heavily, as he felt pressured and afraid.</p>

  <p>There were six great cultivation places in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>They included the Dragon Flyer race's Valley of Time for breaking through cultivation levels, the Harmony race's Mind Refining Tower for state of mind cultivation, the Collapsing Mountain race's strength source for body cultivation, the Kaleidoscope race's Wind Exterminating Valley for laws cultivation, the Skyland race for the cultivation of Pristine Life Vitality, and the Soul Seal race's Divine Soul Ancestral Land where warriors could cultivate souls.</p>

  <p>Among the three major kinds of cultivation, the soul cultivation was second to body and life vitality cultivations, and was the third pillar supporting any martial artist. Naturally, it was an important link for any warrior.</p>

  <p>Seven out of ten Godly Geniuses entered the Divine Soul Ancestral Land, but due to the limited time, Lawson, Karl and Lone had missed the opportunity to enter and were brought into the Valley of Time directly.</p>

  <p>Except for the Skyland race, Luo Luo Zheng made extraordinary achievements in the five cultivation places.</p>

  <p>Presently, Luo Zheng's soul was flashing with a dazzling golden light. On the surface of his translucent soul, there were visibly cambered golden imprints. Such an imprint was regarded as the Emperor Soul Imprint of the Divine Soul Ancestral Land. Those who possessed the Emperor Soul Imprint could give off the formidable soul pressure through their Mu Ning, causing people to lose feeling. This allowed Luo Luo Zheng to make people submit to him without fail.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe, not many martial artists managed to cultivate and possess the Gold Fighting Souls. There were only Supreme Lords and a small number of grand world lords who were able to do so.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's Gold Fighting Soul was releasing a powerful pressure, and guaranteed a stronger effect when matched with the Emperor Soul Imprint.</p>

  <p>Thoroughly, as he asked his question, the warrior trembled in his shoes.</p>

  <p>He subconsciously replied, "My, my name is Aiden Long!"</p>

  <p>"Stop," Luo Luo Zheng ordered again.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could suppress the warrior with strength, but used mere words to bring him into submission. He also had every intention of testing out what he had learned in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Escaping was the instant thought of the warrior. However, as Luo Luo Zheng uttered his words, the warrior struggled in fear and finally stopped.</p>

  <p>Aiden Long's eyes were fearful as he looked at Luo Luo Zheng, no longer trying to resist.</p>

  <p>"Which supreme world are we in?" Luo Luo Zheng asked calmly.</p>

  <p>Aiden Long's lips flickered with hesitation. However, he felt that his soul was being completely suppressed by Luo Luo Zheng, as if he was in control of it.</p>

  <p>The words slowly fell from his lips. "This is the Seven Ultimate World..."</p>

  <p>"Seven Ultimate World?" Luo Luo Zheng was slightly surprised.</p>

  <p>The Seven Ultimate World was a borderline world of the Humanity Alliance, and this world bordered the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng had left the Evolutionary Universe, the Sacred race only occupied three of the supreme worlds of the Spring race. If the Sacred race attacked and occupied the Seven Ultimate World, wouldn't that mean that the entire Humanity Alliance was occupied?</p>

  <p>The situation was worse than he expected.</p>

  <p>In Luo Zheng's perspective, no matter how strong the Sacred race was, it was impossible for them to completely occupy several thousand supreme worlds of the Humanity Alliance within three years. After all, every supreme world was vast and boundless. Supreme Lords in the universe couldn't just stand by, without trying to defend their lands.</p>

  <p>And what about Supreme Lord of Oracle, Supreme Lord Healum, and Yolande?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was lost in deep thought. He looked at Aiden Long and asked,</p>

  <p>"What is the situation in the Evolutionary Universe right now?"</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, his eyes flashed with a golden glow. The emperor Mu Ning from the Emperor Soul Imprint shot towards Aiden Long, making him unable to resist. His eyes sank, and his teeth chattered. He could not withstand the pressure, not even to speak.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Luo Zheng withdrew a portion of his soul pressure and continued,</p>

  <p>"How is the situation?"</p>

  <p>"Our Sacred warriors... destroyed the Humanity Alliance and killed three Supreme Lords of the human race. The elites of the Humanity Alliance have already retreated to the Thoughtless Minds," Aiden Long choked out.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. He knew the warrior was smart enough not to lie. "What about the Demon Night?"</p>

  <p>"The Demon Night race already allied themselves with our Sacred race.</p>

  <p>They originally planned to declare war on the Thoughtless Minds, but they were held back by the ogre race," Aiden Long replied.</p>

  <p>"They were stopped by the ogres?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng asked, surprise apparent in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Humans always liked beautiful things. Luo Luo Zheng had a good feeling about the Demon Night race, but he never thought that this race was Murphy's spy for the Evolutionary Universe. The Demon Night and the sorcerer race had the same goal, and they intended to subvert the entire Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>The conflict between Luo Luo Zheng and the ogre didn't stop in the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Although the members of this race were brave, and they went against Luo Luo Zheng several times, he did not expect that the ogre would stop the Demon Night from taking action, becoming the aiding force for humans. This surprised Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Luo Zheng grasped the current state of the Evolutionary Universe and thought hard.</p>

  <p>He then looked back at Aiden Long and asked, "Why is there a blood rain here?"</p>

  <p>"Blood rain... Blood rain..." The warrior hesitated once again, unwilling to explain.</p>

  <p>"If you don't want to tell me, I have many ways to get it out of you. For example, soul searching," Luo Luo Zheng threatened.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng wanted information, he could search the warrior's soul and retrieve what he needed. However, there was no need to go through so much trouble.</p>

  <p>All the color rushed from Aiden's face as he remained pale and silent. He knew Luo Luo Zheng wasn't one to play games.</p>

  <p>"That blood rain is of human blood. In order to prevent the members of the Humanity Alliance from taking back this place, we collect the human blood and cast the Blood Curse Technique to pollute this place," he admitted. The reason he was unwilling to answer was not out of confidentiality, but because the Sacred race's methods were always too cruel. He was afraid that Luo Luo Zheng would kill him out of anger.</p>

  <p>"This is a hell of a lot of blood. How many people have been killed?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, poking his finger into a red puddle and looking toward the sky.</p>

  <p>"The human beings of one supreme world," Aiden Long replied, carefully observing Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Including mortals, right?" Luo Luo Zheng asked again.</p>

  <p>Aiden Long nodded in response.</p>

  <p>Right then, Luo Zheng's pupils slowly rotated and revealed the sharp beams, as if two inch-long daggers were embedded in the center of his pupils.</p>

  <p>Incredible anger rushed through him and took over his being.</p>

  <p>There were countless races fighting in the universe, and the lives of warriors were usually at risk in times like this.</p>

  <p>But the warriors knew a line had to be drawn. Innocent mortals did not deserve such treatment.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of mortals, the world of martial artists was only an illusion.</p>

  <p>Martial artists were immortal in their eyes.</p>

  <p>Battles among martial artists were always only between immortals and gods, without any interference or participation from mortals.</p>

  <p>Even when the battle between the Thoughtless Minds and the Humanity Alliance was extremely intense, the mortals of the supreme worlds still led peaceful lives in their kingdoms. Only the wars among Supreme Lords accounted for the destruction of their worlds. Normally, it would never have to affect mortal kingdoms.</p>

  <p>The line had been crossed. The most brutal creatures would never have acted out this way, but the Sacred race made themselves an exception.</p>

  <p>As everyone knew, the Sacred race regarded mortal beings no different from animals. Killing hundreds of billions of mortals was nothing to them.</p>

  <p>They believed that all living beings were equal, but beneath them. Only their race was superior.</p>
