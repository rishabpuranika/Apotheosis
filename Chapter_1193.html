  <p>
</p>

  <p>A wave of silence washed over Luo Luo Zheng when his soul entered the girl's mind. The Soul Core had no effects, and his soul didn't get ejected.</p>

  <p>However, the Soul Sea Realm masters were worried about Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although the people of the four divine kingdoms had thoroughly checked all areas in the cemetery, this woman's identity was still unknown. Even if she could speak, no one could figure out from her voice if she was dead or alive.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had smashed the crystal coffin as soon as he reached it, but it would be too risky to take over this woman's body.</p>

  <p>But this woman had been locked up for an immeasurable amount of time. Even if she was a Spirit Supreme Realm master, her lifespan should've been long exhausted. She still wouldn't escape death, even after having experienced the Five Aging Processes!</p>

  <p>It was impossible for the masters in the universe to escape their lifespans' limitation. It was just that their lifespans had varying lengths.</p>

  <p>Therefore, taking such a risk was definitely worth it. At that time, War King Wind, Turner and War Emperor York wanted to give it a try.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng managed to occupy the corpse before the others could take a chance.</p>

  <p>When they saw Luo Luo Zheng enter the physical body, all movements suddenly stopped. Everyone became worried and wanted to see what happened.</p>

  <p>At that moment, several Soul Sea Realm masters, who controlled the corpses they had just occupied, approached the young girl's corpse.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm master who was the nearest to the young girl's body stood only a few feet away. When he looked closer, the girl's eyes suddenly opened!</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters were quick to react, since they occupied corpses of some powerful Soul Sea Realm masters. Although the bodies were all dead, the masters had activated most of the corpses' strengths using the Soul Cores.</p>

  <p>However, the nearest Soul Sea Realm master still couldn't escape!</p>

  <p>The young girl's eyes were sharp, and had golden pupils. A golden light enveloped the Soul Sea Realm master in front of her, who suddenly howled out in pain.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, cracks began to form on the corpse's skin, which was inhabited by the Soul Sea Realm master. The cracks continued to spread like the dry ground during an earthquake.</p>

  <p>The corpses had been in storage for at least ten thousand years. The blood in their bodies had dried up long ago, so no red liquid flowed out when the corpse collapsed. However, the Soul Sea Realm master's soul was forced out of the disintegrated corpse.</p>

  <p>The soul continued to howl and couldn't escape from the clutches of the young girl's gaze. The Fighting Soul should've been unbelievably strong, but it quickly dissolved like ice in the hot summer heat under the golden light.</p>

  <p>In just a blink of an eye, it completely vanished.</p>

  <p>"So ruthless... This young girl is definitely alive!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone, move back. Don't get any closer!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know how Tianxing is doing now. I just hope he doesn't die here. I shouldn't have brought him into the Divine Emperor Secret Land this time!"</p>

  <p>In the beginning, the Soul Sea Realm masters all thought that Luo Zheng's soul was stronger than theirs, so entering the Divine Emperor Secret Land might not be a problem. Luo Zheng's powerful strength could easily take over the corpse of a Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>But who would've thought that Luo Luo Zheng would want to occupy the body of the young girl in the pillar?</p>

  <p>Now, the tables had turned as they were afraid that Luo Luo Zheng might stir up a lot of trouble.</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm masters, Callan, Randy, and the others all stepped aside. They nervously stared at the girl in the pillar in silence, afraid that she would suddenly attack them.</p>

  <p>If this young girl was really alive, she could probably kill everyone as her cultivation base was at the Spirit Supreme Realm!</p>

  <p>After that moment of silence, they all saw the young girl slowly close her golden eyes. Relief flooded their senses.</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty, what should we do now?" a Soul Sea Realm master asked Turner. Now, Turner and War King Wind were upset. According to the original plan, everyone who entered the cemetery was supposed to occupy a corpse and continue to advance towards the Heavenly Stellar Secret Land.</p>

  <p>As for the four divine kingdom rulers, they were to think how to occupy the corpses on the thirteenth floor. If they made it, they would occupy them. If they failed, they would give up on the corpses and try to occupy the other ones. For instance, one of the divine kingdom rulers, Scott, tried to control a corpse but was unsuccessful. Thus, he just gave up.</p>

  <p>However, no one expected Luo Luo Zheng to mess up the original plan and occupy that woman's body. So now, he ended up in such a troublesome situation.</p>

  <p>Turner hesitated for a while before he gritted his teeth and said, "Wait!"</p>

  <p>At that point, he wasn't sure whether Luo Luo Zheng was dead or alive. But after he saw the miserable ending of that Soul Sea Realm master whose soul had been melted, he thought that Luo Luo Zheng was most likely in great danger now.</p>

  <p>Then again, everyone's fate in the world was set by the heavens, and it had to follow some sort of logic.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was blessed with good luck and had even opened the Mahayana Lotus Flower before. Such a warrior with a lucky destiny would definitely not die in a Lower World. He might shoulder a more challenging mission, and make greater achievements in the future.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Turner decided to wait and check what happened to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>While the blood sacrifice's power in the Feather Holy Sea would gradually recover over time, there were at least a few more days left.</p>

  <p>Thus, they weren't that pressed for time.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the crowd could only watch from a safe distance away from the young girl in the pillar, and wait quietly.</p>

  <p>Waves of lighting flashed and thunder roared within the world in the girl's body, and then sprinkled onto the sea of life vitality.</p>

  <p>The young girl didn't appear to be too malicious towards Luo Luo Zheng. She only told him to follow her obediently when she was carried by the aboriginals towards the side of the island.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, Luo Luo Zheng saw an extremely primitive tribe. There were quite a few people, with old and young alike everywhere. However, they seemed to live in an older time as majority of the natives were naked.</p>

  <p>After they entered the tribe, an old man with a bag of skulls on his back showed up. He waved the white bone cane in his hand and crawled towards the young girl. Soon after, all the people in the tribe knelt down in front of her in a reverent manner.</p>

  <p>"You created all these humans, right?" asked Luo Luo Zheng. The girl's lips curved into a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they all call me 'God of Creation'. I think that's the right name. It took me a lot of time to create this world?"</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>As the girl spoke, another wave of thunder struck the sea. The crack of thunder crashed within the small world, as if it was about to destroy it. In turn, the entire sea of life vitality let out a roar.</p>

  <p>The young girl chuckled at Luo Zheng's shocked expression and said, "Don't be afraid. This thunder's power is not strong. It's just that it's quite scary in the inner world. I've put in a lot of time and energy just to obtain the thunder. The crystal coffin can't draw the thunder towards it. When it rained and thundered, I could only let the thunder pass through the chains and into my body. It's too inconvenient?"</p>

  <p>The Spirit Supreme Realm warrior could indeed solidify the life vitality.</p>

  <p>But even if a continent was created in the Soul Sea, it would still be lifeless. If one wanted his body to be filled with living things, then the only way was to continuously draw in thunder to constantly strike the continent. Only then would some low-level creatures begin to appear in the life vitality sea.</p>

  <p>After that, life would slowly evolve. It usually took hundreds, or thousands, or even tens of thousands of years to make the world fully alive and vigorous.</p>

  <p>"It took me one hundred and twenty thousand years to nurture this island as well as the various creatures in it," the young girl sighed softly.</p>

  <p>"After one hundred and twenty thousand years, it's only this little..." Luo Luo Zheng was stunned. This speed was much slower than he had expected.</p>

  <p>The young girl smiled and shook her head. "You don't understand. The inner world's nurturing speed is extremely fast. The birth of the first and most insignificant creature might take one hundred thousand years, but it would only take a few thousand years for this civilization to grow and prosper!"</p>

  <p>"So that's the case," Luo Luo Zheng said, blinking his eyes. He didn't feel too much malice from this woman, so he asked again carefully, "But why did you lock me up here?"</p>

  <p>To Luo Zheng's surprise, the young girl smiled and said, "Creating the world on my own is too boring. Stay here and create the world with me. Isn't that very interesting?"</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Luo Zheng was utterly speechless and surprised when he heard her.</p>

  <p>He originally wanted to retort that it was not fun at all, but he didn't say that. After a moment of thought, he said, "My soul left my body, and my physical body is still outside. My soul can leave my body for a few days, but if it stays outside away from my physical body for too long, I'm afraid that I will be in trouble."</p>

  <p>The young girl pouted and said, "It doesn't matter." She added, "My soul is also disconnected from my physical body all the time. Look, my physical body is still alive and well, so is my soul! I have a way to make your soul immortal! This method was inherited from the Soul Race. Do you want me to teach you?"</p>
