<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 202 The Demon’s Holy Fire (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Zheng was trapped in the transparent enchantment. The space was too narrow for him to move his head, let alone to dodge.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the demon king attacked, and it was directed at Zheng. The attack was so strong that it could rip Zheng's body apart.</p>

  <p>Zheng was in a critical situation right now. Even if he could move, it was hardly possible for him to dodge Aldrich's bone spur with its speed. Even if he could see it, there was no time for him to react.</p>

  <p>"I don't have enough power to destroy this transparent enchantment. But I bet for Aldrich, this would be like smashing a fragile egg. This might be the end of me!" Zheng brooded resentfully as the bone spur attack got closer to him.</p>

  <p>The moment the bone spur nearly stabbed him, Zheng suddenly felt that a force lifted him up and slightly tilted him to one side.</p>

  <p>The bone spur brushed past him and left a small graze on his face.</p>

  <p>"A narrow escape!"</p>

  <p>Zheng breathed a sigh of relief. Though he was grateful, Zheng was still surprised at Yolande's gesture of saving him in this very critical moment.</p>

  <p>He thought she didn't care for him at all.</p>

  <p>But if Yolande did care, why did she bother to bring him along with her?</p>

  <p>It was hard for Zheng to decipher Yolande's mind.</p>

  <p>But in fact, Yolande's mind wasn't complicated at all. She didn't have much consideration on things and only had one simple purpose.</p>

  <p>Zheng was undeniably guilty in Yolande's perspective. She thought he should be handed to the Military Office for trial and punishment.</p>

  <p>However, she was worried that the Military Office would eventually let Zheng go, thus she decided to bring him along instead.</p>

  <p>Her way of thinking might be considered odd by any other normal person.</p>

  <p>Especially now that she was fighting the demon king, bringing Zheng would be a burden to her victory.</p>

  <p>Despite that, Yolande still believed that Zheng's fate must be decided by the Military Office alone and not by the demon king Aldrich. Thus, she had no intention of leaving him behind to die.</p>

  <p>Not only that she had to face the demon king Aldrich's attack, but she also had to protect Zheng from being hurt.</p>

  <p>Yolande would find it a strain even to handle an one-on-one fight with demon king Aldrich. Now she was under a greater pressure that she had to protect Zheng at the same time.</p>

  <p>As a demon king, Aldrich not only had unimaginable strength but also great wisdom that could compare to humans'. From his previous attacks, he assessed that Yolande's attention was diverted to protect Zheng.</p>

  <p>He used this to his advantage and launched simultaneous fatal attacks to both Yolande and Zheng.</p>

  <p>In every situation, Yolande had always been calm and composed.</p>

  <p>Even a deadly situation wouldn't ripple Yolande's mind and heart. But at this moment, the situation was different because she had to handle two things at the same time – dodging Aldrich's attacks and protecting Zheng from the bone spur shot.</p>

  <p>In no time, Yolande and Zheng were now at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Aldrich took the opportunity and fluttered his two big wings, causing strong winds. Yolande could feel the mighty strength of the attack from the beast, and the nearer he got to them, the more ferocious he became.</p>

  <p>She was almost overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>Being in Yolande's entrapment, Zheng watched with horror as the attack unfolded to them.</p>

  <p>Yolande grabbed Zheng and dodged Aldrich's attack at the right moment.</p>

  <p>She flew, dived, and swerved left and right to avoid Aldrich. Zheng was just there clinging onto Yolande and doing nothing.</p>

  <p>The bone spur attacks missed him. But if one of those hit him, he would be dead on the spot. Anyone who was on his situation would tremble in fear and would have already given up.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you can just let me go. Don't worry, I won't die from falling to the ground," Zheng said. He knew he was slowing Yolande down. She had a better chance of winning over Aldrich if she wasn't carrying Zheng. But she was stubborn as hell and refused to let him go.</p>

  <p>Zheng was no ordinary man. He could withstand a fall from a high level and still live.</p>

  <p>"No. I know you'll run away as soon as I let you go," Yolande said seriously as she struggled to dodge a blow from Aldrich.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know whether to laugh or cry at Yolande's remark. He sighed,</p>

  <p>"Really? That's what you're worried about in this situation? I should be the least of your priorities now. There's no use of you keeping me alive when you're dead."</p>

  <p>Yolande thought for a while. Her eyes narrowed with determination as she said, "You're right. Even if you run away, I can still catch you anytime. Get ready! I'll release you!"</p>

  <p>But before Yolande could release Zheng, Aldrich launched another fatal blow.</p>

  <p>The demon king stretched his arms and legs and a black energy mass started to accumulate in front of him. It was the demon core of the demon king.</p>

  <p>The moment the demon core appeared, it started to emit evil spirits.</p>

  <p>Instead of spreading randomly, the spirits seemed to be manipulated by some invisible force and they formed into certain figures like water being poured into a vessel. They finally became magic runes.</p>

  <p>The runes were far from the characters used by the humans and each seemed to symbolize something. In no time, there were already hundreds of runes slowly spinning around the demon core.</p>

  <p>"Yolande, watch out! It's the holy fire of the demon king Aldrich!"</p>

  <p>Spencer called out to her from not so far away.</p>

  <p>He recognized the runes at once since he fought with Aldrich before and had been possessed by him before. He felt the urge to warn Yolande of this attack.</p>
