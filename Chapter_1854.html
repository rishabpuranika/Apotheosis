<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1854 Gigantic Badger (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>According to Teigan, although the paths of the Sacred Spring Mountain were quite complicated, they would still lead to the main road at the bottom of the mountain. One could follow the main road from the bottom of the mountain to the top and find their way back to the Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>If this was true, then the path that Zheng had taken should lead them to the main road. From his calculations, they should be at the bottom of the Sacred Spring Mountain by now.</p>

  <p>However, it seemed that they were led to a dead end. Instead of the main road, the two discovered a cave in a sealed-off area - a place that no one had entered before.</p>

  <p>Looking around, Zheng realized that the door in front of him was the only way out. Would he be able to leave this place?</p>

  <p>The situation was starting to get frustrating. But Zheng had already made up his mind. If this place turned out to be a dead-end, he would turn back to where he came from and start again!</p>

  <p>The most challenging and difficult part of the Sacred Spring Mountain was the solid silver rock. Its surface was extremely smooth, not even a curb or a lump that one could hold onto, thus making it hard to climb.</p>

  <p>In this situation, all the strength source that Zheng had absorbed could be put to good use. Now that his power had increased drastically, it had changed the course of the situation.</p>

  <p>Standing at the front of the stone door, Teigan was the first to try his luck. He placed his hands against the stone door, took a deep breath, and pushed it.</p>

  <p>Ha-ha!</p>

  <p>Teigan put all his energy into his arms and hands; and as a great force flowed into his body, his veins and muscles suddenly bulged.</p>

  <p>The strength source had increased Teigan's strength exponentially, and he felt reborn. He pushed against the door with all his might, but the stone door did not even budge.</p>

  <p>Teigan knew that he had exhausted his strength to the limit, so when he saw that nothing had happened, he gave up and jokingly said, "I guess I'm not worthy!" He looked around to find Zheng. The latter had already absorbed so much strength source and was readying himself for his turn.</p>

  <p>There was no way he would surrender as Teigan did. A member of the Collapsing Mountain race would always be proud of his strength and would never depend on a man from another race.</p>

  <p>On Teigan's mark, Zheng slowly approached the stone door with an indifferent expression in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng had achieved many breakthroughs: he refined his body with preternatural flames, absorbed the strength source, constructed Eight Path Platforms and forged Nine Divine Stars in Collapsing Mountain race.</p>

  <p>The power that he harnessed was quite different from the power he would usually borrow from a Genuine Dragon.</p>

  <p>It felt even more real. This hidden power from his body was so extreme that whenever he made a move, it would naturally explode from every part of his body.</p>

  <p>Another thing was, Zheng could not yet use the full potential of the borrowed power.</p>

  <p>But the power that he had harnessed right now felt like water smoothly flowing out of his body.</p>

  <p>Zheng now stood at the front of the door. He then slowly extended his hands and placed them on the stone door.</p>

  <p>"Open for me!" Zheng commanded.</p>

  <p>In an instant, an enormous force was released from his hands.</p>

  <p>The power suddenly spread out and blew like a strong wind!</p>

  <p>Swishy, swishy, swishy!</p>

  <p>Teigan felt strong pressure from the power that Zheng had released. He tried to keep his ground but lost his balance and was pushed back. If he hadn't used his left foot to fight the pressure, he would have rolled to the ground several steps away from the door. The place was suddenly covered in dust, and Teigan had to shield his eyes.</p>

  <p>With the strength that Zheng had exerted, Teigan was positive that the door would move. When the dust finally settled, Teigan immediately looked at the door. But to his surprise and dismay, the door had not moved even the slightest.</p>

  <p>The strength source that Zheng's physical body harnessed was several times greater than Teigan's, but in the end, it still wasn't enough.</p>

  <p>"Eight Path Platforms!" Zheng commanded.</p>

  <p>And the Eight Path Platforms on his body began to radiate brightly.</p>

  <p>The strength frantically spread out from the Eight Path Platforms, causing Zheng's strength to increase by another fold!</p>

  <p>Zheng already showcased an unimaginable power from mere body strength, and now that he used the Eight Path Platforms, that immense body strength had become more powerful.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>A muffled rumble could be heard from the stone door in front of him as it revealed a small crack. Zheng had finally pushed the door open.</p>

  <p>And there was hope. The rumbling sound of the door continued as Zheng exerted the same force onto it. Then it went silent. Zheng drew his arms back, looked at the door, and smirked. Alas, the door was finally open. It wasn't fully opened, but the crack was enough for the two of them to pass through.</p>

  <p>"I knew you could do it! Awesome!" A ray of hope shone from Teigan's eyes.</p>

  <p>It was a custom in the Collapsing Mountain race to revere Hercules. The ideology of this race was quite simple: they honored the strongest. Aside from the prophet, the Collapsing Mountain race also worshiped the most powerful and strongest being. Even outsiders would get a chance to lead this race if they proved themselves worthy.</p>

  <p>The world on the other side of the door was dark. But Zheng didn't hesitate and went into that dark side through the door. Teigan followed suit.</p>

  <p>But the moment Zheng stepped into the other side of the door, something unexpected suddenly happened – a bright light emitted from within the Eight-diagram Ball in his hand. Zheng could sense bizarre aura coming from the ball. In an instant, the ball escaped from Zheng's hand and rapidly flew outside the door towards the direction where the two came from.</p>

  <p>After flying a great distance, the ball fell into the lake of strength source and a loud splashing sound could be heard.</p>
