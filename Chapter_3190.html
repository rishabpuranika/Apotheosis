  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Su Clan was alarmed by Luo Zheng's actions.</p>

  <p>Cailen stood on the wall, watching the surrounding area with narrowed eyes. Several others flew out from the house of the Su Clan, heightening the tension among the members of the clan.</p>

  <p>"Who are they? Why are they hiding outside our house?" Cailen asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook his head. "I don't know. It could be that they are spying on me.</p>

  <p>But it's equally likely that they're spying on the Su Clan, or on some specific person in the clan."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't be sure. All he knew for certain was that the Su Clan's house was being spied on, as discovered by No. 9527.</p>

  <p>"It takes a lot of nerve to spy on a clan like ours,"</p>

  <p>Cailen said, a serious expression on his face.</p>

  <p>The Su Clan had amassed a lot of power throughout the years. As the rulers of the Su City, they had enemies within and outside the city, so news of spying definitely warranted a thorough investigation.</p>

  <p>Cailen looked up to address a man on the roof. "Listen up. The guards have to patrol more frequently this month. You will report any suspicious activity to me as soon as possible," he ordered.</p>

  <p>"It will be done," the man answered promptly, hurrying off to disseminate Cailen's orders.</p>

  <p>Cailen turned back to Luo Zheng and grinned at him wryly. "We are grateful for your warning, Luo Zheng. You should get some rest in your room. Rest assured, we will look closely into this threat, although I'm quite certain no one would dare to harm my clan in our own city."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, looking thoughtful. He bid goodbye to Cailen and flew back to his courtyard.</p>

  <p>The next day, under Cailen's lead, the group left the Su Clan's house together. They headed for the refining place within the heart of the Su City.</p>

  <p>The site of the Su City was not an accident. The Su Clan had chosen to build their city in this location for several important reasons.</p>

  <p>The water of the Clear Lake was generally ice-cold. But there was an area in the western region of the lake where the water temperature was much higher. Even during winter, a person who dipped his hand into the lake would instantly feel the warmth of the water. Regardless of how long winter lasted or how cold it got, the lake never froze over.</p>

  <p>The Su Clan's ancestors were intrigued by this phenomenon and decided to explore why the lake was warm in that area. They discovered that a broad, powerful channel of the underground fire vein ran under that section of the lake.</p>

  <p>The underground fire vein was deep. It was also long and large, running under the lake all the way to a different province. The Su Clan saw its potential immediately. With great joy, they decided to settle right there.</p>

  <p>They spent years digging near the lake. Eventually, they struck gold? they had penetrated deep enough to reach the underground fire vein.</p>

  <p>When they first established the city, the underground fire vein was the private property of the Su Clan. However, as more and more weapon refiners arrived to make use of the fire vein, the Su Clan decided to make it public.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, Cailen, and the others headed to the western part of the Su City, where the refining place was located. There was a dark earthen wall ahead of them. When they passed through the wall, the temperature suddenly soared, becoming almost unbearably hot. Luo Zheng realized that the wall enclosed the refining place, which was an area completely different from the calm, cool city that surrounded it.</p>

  <p>Weapon refiners walked and worked all around them, all stripped bare from the waist up, their skin red from the heat and shining with sweat.</p>

  <p>"With the help of the underground fire vein in the refining place, the power of all the arrays can be increased by several times. This will allow us to melt the Shade Stone more quickly," explained Cailen as he led them through the maze of busy refiners.</p>

  <p>"Do I need Eira's assistance this time?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>In the Blue Cloud City, the most important thing used to melt the Shade Stone was not the flame, but the power of Eira's blood.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hoped her blood wasn't needed here. He didn't have the heart to make use of the pale, overworked girl who had grown up alongside Gant.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we need her. But don't worry. Recently, Eira hasn't participated in any weapon refining, nor did she use the power of her blood. The Taiyi Heaven Palace has given us a Blood Upgrading Pill to make up for our loss,"</p>

  <p>Cailen replied. A sudden smile flashed across his face, excitement lighting up his eyes.</p>

  <p>"A Blood Upgrading Pill?" Luo Zheng asked, raising his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I never dreamed of obtaining such a high-quality pill like that," Cailen said proudly. "You know, it can upgrade the blood and is rare even in the Taiyi Heaven Palace. It's said that only one pill can be produced every thousand years!"</p>

  <p>"Upgrade the blood?" Luo Zheng mused, catching Cailen's excitement and feeling interested.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, he had never heard of any pill that could upgrade a warrior's blood.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng didn't need to upgrade his blood. Without the ancient god's blood, he would have the purest imperial-grade bloodline of the Nine Li race. The ancient god's blood had made his blood impure.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng wondered about the possibilities of the pill, No. 9527 interrupted his thoughts. It sneered, "Forget it! The Blood Upgrading Pill can upgrade the blood of some small clans, but it can't improve the Chaos Ancient God's blood. That's wishful thinking!"</p>

  <p>"Really? I see," Luo Zheng sighed, his expression changing from excitement to disappointment.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient God had only given him a portion of blood marrow, and so far, the blood marrow hadn't improved a bit. Moreover, the power of the Truth Crystal that he condensed was not strong enough, so he seldom used the Truth Crystal to resist attacks.</p>

  <p>Cailen had no idea of the thoughts running through Luo Zheng's mind. Without noticing the change in Luo Zheng's expression, Cailen continued, "Yes. Eira's blood of the Ore Shadow race has become much purer. As long as we don't use her too much, she is more than capable of dealing with it."</p>

  <p>"Can the Blood Upgrading Pill enhance all kinds of blood? Can it enhance the blood of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, for example? It doesn't seem possible,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, if one wanted to obtain a steady supply of someone else's blood, he needed that person's blood marrow.</p>

  <p>It was said that the Ore Shadow race had been completely annihilated. It was unbelievable that a single pill could increase the concentration of blood of the Ore Shadow race in Eira.</p>

  <p>Cailen grinned and said, "You are a newcomer in the Taiyi Heaven Palace, so you have yet to explore the vast, vast wealth of treasures there. It is impossible for ordinary pill refiners to make such pills. Only the head of the Origin Mountain has the ability to refine the Blood Upgrading Pill. Her Other Shore Token is very mysterious. It is said that her token can copy anything out of thin air, so blood can also be copied."</p>

  <p>"Copy anything out of thin air?" Astonishment was written all over Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>Such an ability was supposed to be unique to the inner worlds. For example, Luo Zheng was able to copy something out of thin air in his inner world. But it should be impossible for people in the Source World to actually copy something out of thin air even with the help of the Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"Hey, No. 9527, do you hear that?" Luo Zheng shouted inwardly. "That's the ability of the head of the Origin Mountain. Maybe the Blood Upgrading Pill could work!"</p>

  <p>"No way," No. 9527 replied curtly.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 clearly thought it was impossible, but Luo Zheng was still excited.</p>

  <p>The head of the Origin Mountain was second only to Eastern Emperor Taiyi. The Other Shore Token she had must be extraordinary. Maybe she really could make a true Blood Upgrading Pill.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng decided that the first opportunity he got, he would ask Dorothy about it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng followed Cailen and the others as they walked, going deeper and deeper into the refining place. The temperature became burning hot, stinging his skin. From time to time, rays of multicolored light burst out from the black ground around him.</p>

  <p>After they moved forward, they saw several iron fences in front of them.</p>

  <p>The Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array of the Su Clan was set up within the fences.</p>

  <p>Cailen walked through the fences and gestured for everyone to follow. Once they were all in, he turned to Luo Zheng and said solemnly, "Please put the two weapons in the center of the array."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took out the Shade Phoenix Sword and the hammer, placing them where Cailen had directed.</p>

  <p>The Shade Phoenix Sword was a top-grade weapon, but Luo Zheng had never used it. It was a huge waste to melt it directly. However, in order to strengthen his body, he had no choice.</p>

  <p>Gant's uncles spread out, each taking a position in the array.</p>

  <p>Beams of glowing green light rose from the array. As the beams lengthened, they began to intersect with each other, forming a massive column of green light that encompassed the two weapons in the center. The Shade Phoenix Sword and the hammer slowly rose up as they were lifted into the air by the light column.</p>
