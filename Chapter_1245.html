  <p>
</p>

  <p>Actually, Max wanted to say something to Klein.</p>

  <p>According to Celestial Position conventions and rules, all warriors who managed to receive a title from the Talent Tablet would be invited to join. That was regardless of race.</p>

  <p>Now that Klein had obtained the silver Asura title, Max was naturally going to invite him to join his clan, especially considering the fact that the former's title was better than his own.</p>

  <p>Amber would also have been invited, but she was only able to get a spot in the second row of the Talent Tablet. Although this was considered as one of the top results in the Sea God Continent, in the eyes of the Celestial Position, this was barely qualifying. The second row of the Talent Tablet was the lowest level of the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>However, before Max could even open his mouth, the human girl had already spoken and inferred their origins. She had been able to learn of that through a single glance and that spoke to her powers. Max, Delroy and the others immediately became alert when they heard her say that.</p>

  <p>Zheng's cursory gaze swept over them and then met Yolande's. A faint smile surfaced on his face.</p>

  <p>Yolande also nodded her head towards Zheng and smiled in return. She then continued, "Klein is from the Purple Heart Sacred Place. He belongs with the humans who will give him an important position once he flies into the Upper World. I recommend that the Celestial Position does not do anything to interfere."</p>

  <p>Hearing Yolande's words, Delroy and his clansmen frowned. This wasn't something they wanted.</p>

  <p>Now that they had confirmed Zheng's talent, and in the process, accidentally discovered another one, they weren't going to let the two of them go so easily. They would try their best to win over Zheng and Klein.</p>

  <p>Max coldly asked, "And who are you? Which group of the human race are you from?"</p>

  <p>"That's irrelevant." Yolande shook her head and continued in her usual, calm voice, "I'm just here to tell you that we won't let you take Klein away."</p>

  <p>Delroy gave a cold snort. "Whatever! The flying passage in the great world has already collapsed. If we don't take him to the Upper World with us, he will only get confined to this world for the rest of his life."</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about that. It's not going to be difficult to repair the flying passage." Yolande shook her head.</p>

  <p>Max took two steps forward and sized up Yolande with a sweep of his gaze before threatening, "You have just reached the Virtual Tribulation Realm. How can you stop us?"</p>

  <p>Yolande's gaze was still indifferent. "You're just a bunch of guys at the Spirit Supreme Realm. Why can't I stop you?"</p>

  <p>At her words, seven pairs of eyes of the Celestial Position stared speechlessly at each other. How could this mysterious human girl actually tell their cultivation level? She had done that with only a part of her soul. Who on earth was she?</p>

  <p>Seeing the expressions of utter embarrassment on their face, Yolande put up her rare smile. "You know what? Klein may not be destined to join your clan, and I will fight for him. But Zheng... Well, he has his fate under his own control. If he's willing to join you, I won't stop him."</p>

  <p>When Zheng had obtained the Heavenly Fragment, Yolande had told him that she would not interfere with his decisions now. Whatever he wanted to do, she would let him and support him.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" What Yolande said left Max and his clansmen perplexed.</p>

  <p>They could give up on Klein, of course. Although very few warriors could have obtained the silver Asura title, there was still a huge gap between it and the gold Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Zheng was also a human. Why was this mysterious woman choosing Klein over Zheng? They couldn't figure out the reason.</p>

  <p>Seeing the perplexed expressions on the seven faces in front of her, Yolande explained faintly, "I don't need to tell you everything. I only need you to know that although Zheng may seem to be able to lead the world of chaos, he is a man without destiny."</p>

  <p>"A man without destiny?"</p>

  <p>Hearing Yolande's words only made them even more confused.</p>

  <p>Dorothea, Woody and other people of the Celestial Position also looked confused.</p>

  <p>Delroy seemed to have understood something, if not everything. His face was filled with shock. "A person without destiny? Did you just say that Zheng is a person without destiny?" He was shaking his head as if the idea was too hard to swallow!</p>

  <p>Zheng also had a strange expression on his face. He didn't know what that meant either. A man without destiny? What did that mean?</p>

  <p>Yolande gently turned around. "This is not a good place to talk about this. Let's go to the living area."</p>

  <p>Everyone followed Yolande and left the Talent Tablet. Several martial artists were quietly having a conversation amongst themselves. Yolande had just said that these people were from the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Although the Tower of Crystal was known as the Tower of Sin on the Sea God Continent, they had learned something interesting from a book that was stored on top of the Tower of Sin. It was said that the tower belonged to the Celestial Position. All the top-level war lords could read the book, so it was not a secret.</p>

  <p>"What does that mean? Are these people at the Spirit Supreme Realm?</p>

  <p>Are they even stronger than the mighty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm?"</p>

  <p>"So the Celestial Position really is the original owner of the Tower of Sin. Have they come here to take the tower away?"</p>

  <p>Many of the creatures on the tenth floor immediately tensed up when they heard these words. The Tower of Sin was far too important for the Sea God Continent to give up. Where would they practice and level up without it?</p>

  <p>The Sea God Continent had always been in chaos, and had originally been a piece of savage land. If it wasn't for the Tower of Sin, it wouldn't have been able to match up to even the Central Region, let alone the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>

  <p>Now that the crowd had heard that the Celestial Position had come to the Tower of Sin, how could they not be nervous?</p>

  <p>"Did Zheng bring them here?"</p>

  <p>"This is too much for me to bear! In the early days, Zheng had also obtained a number of benefits from the tower. Although he…"</p>

  <p>"Don't spout nonsense. Zheng is different from you. He has his own plans for what he's going to do and we never know what's going on in his mind."</p>

  <p>Almost everyone had entered into an endless argument now. Yolande on the other hand had already reached and sat down in the living area. The wooden clogs hanging from her feet lightly knocked on the floor, letting out a crisp sound.</p>

  <p>"What does a man without destiny mean?" Woody asked Delroy curiously.</p>

  <p>Delroy frowned as he thought about how to explain it. "In the Great Realm Pavilion of our clan, I read a book titled 'About Destiny' which records a bizarre doctrine. According to the book, everything in the universe is predestined. Our destiny has been firmly fixed, and we are forced to follow it without any deviation. We can't make our own decisions."</p>

  <p>"Every smile, word, step, and thought has been arranged. What's left is just a meaningless rehearsal," Yolande continued.</p>

  <p>Dorothea puffed her cheeks and shook her head. "I still don't understand!</p>

  <p>I am here. I do what I want to do!"</p>

  <p>"It's normal if you don't understand. Actually, you're not supposed to!"</p>

  <p>Delroy replied expressionlessly. He then stood up and glanced at a wooden tray placed on a nearby stone table. He grabbed the wooden tray and asked, "If I let this go, what will happen?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's obvious. The tray will fall down on the ground," Dorothea replied. She couldn't understand why Delroy would ask something like that.</p>

  <p>Delroy nodded and released his grip. The wooden tray in his hand fell to the ground, producing a crisp sound. "See. You predicted that the tray would fall down."</p>

  <p>"Come on!" Dorothea chuckled. "Everybody knew that would happen!"</p>

  <p>Delroy continued, "You knew that I would let the tray go. You knew the height of the tray and the speed and place of its fall, so you predicted what would happen."</p>

  <p>"Yeah. That's common sense!" Dorothea nodded. She felt Delroy's words were getting more and more mysterious.</p>

  <p>"What if," Delroy was becoming more and more passionate, "What if someone was able to predict everything that would happen in a span of all 3.6 billion years in this era, because he has already witnessed the birth of the era?" He asked.</p>

  <p>"But that is simply impossible!" Woody could not hold it in any longer.</p>

  <p>He stared at Delroy and burst out, "Can you predict what I will do next?</p>

  <p>No! And the era lasts 3.6 billion years. Countless creatures live in this universe. I know that some powerhouses in our clan are capable of predicting the future, but they can only peek a tiny bit into the primordial chaos. You know this better than I do, Delroy! This is impossible!"</p>

  <p>Seeing how passionate Woody looked, Yolande, who was kicking her clogs slowly postulated, "What if it's not a person, but the heaven itself?"</p>

  <p>Delroy nodded. "The heaven has deduced everything. The birth and death of every creature has long been decided. Everything is predestined, including me standing here and saying these words."</p>

  <p>"The heaven..." Woody was somewhat baffled.</p>

  <p>Just then, Yolande turned towards Zheng and asked, "Now do you understand what a man without destiny means?"</p>
