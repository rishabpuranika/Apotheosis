  <p>
</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, those who entered the Chaotic Source World needed to fend for themselves. But if they banded together, they would have a greater chance of succeeding.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the six Nine Li people were willing to follow Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Sally, however, felt a bit disheartened since her number on the petal was so big.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at the number and smiled faintly. "Don't worry. Even if we get separated, we will still be able to locate each other, thanks to the soul marks."</p>

  <p>When they were still on the flying ship, Luo Zheng had marked the bodies of the Nine Li people, Feng Ge, and Dorothy.</p>

  <p>"Okay!" Sally nodded meekly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the members of the super forces studied the numbers on their petals.</p>

  <p>Comparing the numbers between them, some obviously felt a little depressed over the gaps. In low voices, they discussed amongst themselves how they'd meet in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Others glanced at the petals and then decidedly ignored them.</p>

  <p>Milo, the burly young man and the curly haired woman from the Divine Farmer race were among those who ignored the numbers.</p>

  <p>These were the sort of people who were fully confident in their strength and talent, so they frowned upon the idea of working with others.</p>

  <p>Once the woman standing in front of the stone gate had distributed all the petals, she cleared her throat. "Everyone, take your tickets and enter the Chaotic Source World according to your numbers. Now, the first one."</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished her words, a young man from the Bearing race stepped forward.</p>

  <p>Smiling confidently, he rushed towards the stone gate, waving his ticket in the air.</p>

  <p>The number on his petal was "one", so he was the first to enter the Chaotic Source World. He felt extremely lucky.</p>

  <p>After showing his petal at the stone gate, he then pressed his ticket onto the runes by the side of the gate. Once the runes smashed his ticket, he flew in.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, a werewolf with silvery hair from the Celestial Wolf race came forward. The number on its petal was "two". After having its ticket checked, it quickly followed suit.</p>

  <p>The creatures started surging forward according to the numbers on their petals.</p>

  <p>Within an hour, more than six thousand people had entered the Chaotic Source World!</p>

  <p>"The 7, 000th one," the woman at the stone gate called.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge turned to Luo Zheng calmly. "I'm going in."</p>

  <p>Then, she floated elegantly to the gate and stepped inside.</p>

  <p>Later came the 8, 000th one.</p>

  <p>Then, the 9, 000th...</p>

  <p>The 10, 000th...</p>

  <p>The 12, 000th...</p>

  <p>The 13, 000th.</p>

  <p>Even then, many creatures were left at the gate, waiting for their turns.</p>

  <p>"The 13, 352nd!"</p>

  <p>The woman finally called Luo Zheng's number.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled at Dorothy and the six Nine Li people. "I will wait for you inside."</p>

  <p>Then he turned and leapt to the stone gate.</p>

  <p>After he gave his petal to the woman, she said softly, "Yan didn't go deep into the Chaotic Source World. After you enter the stone gate, go right and you'll see her waiting for you there."</p>

  <p>She frowned as she spoke. Luo Zheng could tell she was full of reproach.</p>

  <p>The woman didn't care who Luo Zheng was. She only knew that Yan was willing to delay her own cultivation by waiting for this disciple of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, which made her unhappy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew what she was thinking. With a smile, he placed the ticket on the runes.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>After the ticket was torn apart, Luo Zheng stepped into the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>After passing through the stone gate, Luo Zheng was shrouded in a black smog, and his surroundings became dim.</p>

  <p>Even so, it was not as dark as the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>The Dark Region was completely shrouded in pitch blackness. Here, in the Chaotic Source World, it was as though a thick, black smog clouded everything.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng also felt a strong resistance in the air.</p>

  <p>The air was strangely thick. It was as though he had fallen into a quagmire, with a thick, heavy atmosphere enveloping him.</p>

  <p>"Is this resistance coming from the black smog?" Luo Zheng wondered.</p>

  <p>The smog was everywhere, so he couldn't get rid of the resistance. He tried to blow the smog away by waving his arms, but it didn't do much.</p>

  <p>Gathering thirty Jun of force, he flapped his arms more furiously, and finally the air caved a bit. Only then was he able to walk properly.</p>

  <p>'This smog is truly powerful. This place is inconceivable.' Luo Zheng raised his eyebrow in surprise.</p>

  <p>Those who had just reached the Other Shore Realm wouldn't be able to move in this place. Even if they used all their strength, they wouldn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>The True Gods would probably be crushed by the smog upon entry to the Chaotic Source World!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng, a member of the Separate Abyss race had entered.</p>

  <p>Locking eyes momentarily, Luo Zheng could see a hint of fear in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Although this person didn't know Luo Zheng's true power, Luo Zheng seemed to have attracted the attention of the Human Sovereign. Moreover, the young man in black had come from Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>He figured it was better not to get on such a person's bad side.</p>

  <p>While the Separate Abyss race was known for being arrogant, the man broke eye contact and quickly ducked into the black smog without a word.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged. He didn't have the time to ruminate over such trivial things.</p>

  <p>"Yan is waiting for me on the right side."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng activated the Other Shore Power and flew through the smog.</p>

  <p>Although thirty Jun of force was enough for him to move in the mysterious black smog, it had restricted his freedom to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>He couldn't speed up, nor could he use his explosive power.</p>

  <p>Even so, Luo Zheng knew it was only fair that the Chaotic Source World had this restriction aimed at everyone.</p>

  <p>After flying a bit towards the right, Luo Zheng had seen only rusty-looking stones.</p>

  <p>There was no sign of Yan.</p>

  <p>"Where is she?" Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>Yan was a woman of her word. She had promised she'd meet him there, so where was she?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's frown deepened. If she wasn't here, she could be in trouble.</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but feel a bit worried.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he hadn't left a soul mark on her body, so there was no way of finding her.</p>

  <p>After wandering around for a while, he tried locating Feng Ge. His expression changed abruptly once he found her.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge had entered the Chaotic Source World only shortly before him, yet she was forty thousand miles away from him!</p>

  <p>If they were in the outside world, Luo Zheng wouldn't have been so shocked. After all, they could use the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>However, teleporting was forbidden in the Chaotic Source World. With this smog constricting movement, how could she possibly be that far ahead?</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was busy pondering over this, he failed to notice a wind was steadily rising in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Whir...</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he felt something pushing him fiercely.</p>

  <p>The force of the wind was incredibly powerful. Before Luo Zheng had the time to react, he was violently swept up into the air by the wind.</p>
