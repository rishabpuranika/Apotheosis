<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Fabian's expression was filled with a barely contained joy. Everyone else also felt that it was truly unbelievable.</p>

  <p>Once people were forced into a corner, they would often be able to unleash a power that they could not believe they ever had.</p>

  <p>Previously, the reason why Fabian had asked everyone to run was that he was afraid of alerting the monsters in the Dark Nether Cave. Moreover, he was not sure if they could successfully deal with the Swallowing Birds.</p>

  <p>In the end, without any other way to escape, they had fought to the death and had actually triumphed.</p>

  <p>There were still a few Swallowing Birds circling restlessly in the air above them. These Swallowing Birds were not completely senseless, and they had soon realized that these top-level war lords below them were not an easy meal.</p>

  <p>However, they also clearly knew that there were no monsters in the Dark Nether Cave which were easy to slay. These birds belonged to the bottom of the food chain, so compared to the monsters who dwelt in the Dark Nether Cave, these humans were far easier prey to hunt.</p>

  <p>So they continued circling around the group of humans, refusing to leave.</p>

  <p>At the same time, they kept singing their eerie call, hoping to summon more of their own kind.</p>

  <p>"They are calling for their companions. Let's leave, quickly." Hearing the cries of those strange birds, Fabian frowned and his expression darkened as he led the rest of the group away from the area, though the birds continued tagging along.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still remained in the middle of the group. This Dark Nether Cave was just like what Miguel had said; it was simply too dangerous! Even if Luo Zheng's luck was incredibly good, it still wouldn't be easy for him to successfully obtain the inheritance.</p>

  <p>No matter how fast they ran on the ground, their speed would definitely be inferior to the birds skimming easily through the air. It was simply impossible for them to shake off these strange birds.</p>

  <p>This was proving to be a bit troublesome. Everyone was afraid that the strange birds would summon more birds, while they were also concerned that the noisy birds would attract the monsters in the Dark Nether Cave.</p>

  <p>They couldn't keep running like this. Every time the creatures of the Tower of Sin entered the Dark Nether Cave, they would have to be very careful and cautious. They didn't dare to cause such a ruckus as surely they would become prey to the dangerous monsters. It was pure luck that they hadn't attracted powerful monsters yet, after those birds had made such a ruckus for so long.</p>

  <p>Their luck might be good for a while, but it couldn't hold forever. Sooner or later, it would run out and then they would be in trouble.</p>

  <p>"Let's kill these birds first!" Fabian coldly said as he stopped and stared at the Swallowing Birds winging through the air above them.</p>

  <p>"Sure!"</p>

  <p>"I agree!"</p>

  <p>Actually, several others of the top-level war lords had wanted to stop and kill those birds. It was just that Fabian was the one leading the group, and they had waited to follow his orders. Now that Fabian had made this decision, they immediately shot like arrows towards the birds in the sky.</p>

  <p>The birds were no fools. Upon seeing the people below suddenly shooting up towards the sky, they too started flying up.</p>

  <p>Although the top-level war lords' flying speed was not slow, it was far from being as swift and agile as that of these birds. They circled through the air several times, but it was impossible for them to even touch the birds.</p>

  <p>When the foiled top-level war lords landed on the ground again, the birds flew back closer again. Their cries had taken on a mocking tone, as they continued circling their prey.</p>

  <p>"What bad luck!" Fabian sighed, and a look of deep worry appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>He would rather have these birds charge at them. Now they were unable to drive them away, nor were they able to kill them. These birds would certainly attract even more of their companions in the near future.</p>

  <p>"Quack, quack, quack, quack..."</p>

  <p>As the saying went, "If anything can possibly go wrong, it will go wrong."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a large stain of tumbling black clouds appeared in the not too distant sky, and the disorderly sounds of many birds' chirping could be heard from them.</p>

  <p>The party turned their faces up to the sky and bleakly looked at the dense mass of the strange birds approaching. With so many of them, enough to blacken the sky, they could be at least a thousand strong.</p>

  <p>Everyone's expression darkened. This was an ill-boding prospect.</p>

  <p>Even a single bird had been a challenge for them to deal with. How could they possibly deal with a thousand birds appearing at the same time?</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the inky formation of the strange birds rushed over.</p>

  <p>Their squawking presence in the sky almost blocked out the weak Dark Nether Death Light.</p>

  <p>"Wh-what should we do?" a top-level war lord asked in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>"Scatter! Run away in all directions!" Fabian suggested in a timorous tone.</p>

  <p>"Even if we split up, we are not likely to escape. There are too many strange birds,"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng interjected and looked at the flock of strange birds with a steely glint flashing in his eyes. He then asked, "In the outer area of the Dark Nether Cave, where would the most ferocious monster be?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Fabian asked, confused.</p>

  <p>"We lure these birds over there!" Determination showed on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>At this point, the only thing left to do was take a risk. Although it was difficult to deal with so many birds, there must definitely be an even more powerful monster in existence inside the Dark Nether Cave. Besides, they would surely be killed by the birds if they stayed here. However, if they led the birds to another ferocious monster, they might be able to survive.</p>

  <p>Fabian's mind was spinning very fast. There was no time left for him to even think about it, and Luo Zheng's plan was the only feasible option.</p>
