</p>

  <p>What angered them more was that Zheng was able to resist damage from their attacks. This was beyond their imagination!</p>

  <p>"Damn it! I've used up all my strength!" One of the men stopped and gasped. He felt so weak that he couldn't even raise his arms.</p>

  <p>Under the weight of the pressure on this stretch of the road, the man's body gave out. He collapsed on the ground, shook his head, and said, "This terrible pressure and the running have made me very tired, not to mention beating that brat. Holy crap!"</p>

  <p>The pressure of 4, 000 pounds was originally designed for cultivators at the marrow refining level. Under normal conditions, these men wouldn't have tired. However, their strength ran out faster as they were attacking Zheng while bearing the great pressure. They soon felt weary.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to give up, the scholar-like man suddenly called out with excitement, "He is bleeding!" He saw the red liquid flowing out of Zheng's body and assumed it was blood. He said with pleasure, "I doubted whether this kid's body could be injured. Now, look at him! We have wounded him. He's done! Let's carry on hitting him!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng was bleeding, the four men were overjoyed. They didn't want to fail the client.</p>

  <p>They motivated themselves to keep striking Zheng as hard as possible.</p>

  <p>When Zheng thought they were going to give up hitting him, he felt upset. He could feel his body growing stronger with each blow. It was disappointing that they were giving up. He did not want it to end so quickly.</p>

  <p>However, when they mistook the impurities flowing from Zheng's body to be blood, they thought he was close to reaching his physical limit. So, they renewed their efforts!</p>

  <p>Zheng was ecstatic inside, but he didn't show any emotions. On the contrary, he pretended to be close to complete exhaustion. While suffering their beatings, he staggered forward, being ready to enjoy the second round of body refining.</p>

  <p>Zheng did not know that thirty miles away, the chief examiner, an elderly man with white eyebrows, was watching the scene.</p>

  <p>Beside the chief examiner stood a young woman dressed in green.</p>

  <p>Both of them stared at a waist-high jade slab, also known as the 'Picture Slab', in front of them. They could see everything that was happening on the whole path.</p>

  <p>At this time, the images on the Picture Slab were showing the scene of Zheng being chased and beaten.</p>

  <p>The woman and the chief examiner could not look away. Their expressions conveyed the astonishment they felt.</p>

  <p>"He is resisting the attacks of four cultivators at the marrow refining level, but he is only at the organ refining level. It seems that we have an interesting candidate in the initial exam this month!" said the young woman with a smile.</p>

  <p>The chief examiner felt embarrassed when he heard the young woman's statement. It seemed that the examinee had invoked her interest. He thought for a while and said, "Master Su, you can't think like that! If the masters of the other 32 peaks of Cloud Sect pick their disciples like you do, it will lead to a big mess!"</p>

  <p>Master Su grinned and turned to face the chief examiner. She said, "Well, if that is the case, then let the masters also pick their own disciples. I will not mind."</p>

  <p>"But according to the rules, these disciples are supposed to be allotted to a peak by the ranking of their exam results. Last month, you picked quite a gifted disciple. The other masters have been discontent since. If this month you pick another, then..." The chief examiner elder stopped and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Master Su snorted with disapproval and said, "So what? They are unhappy?</p>

  <p>Well, they can always come and speak with me if they feel that way. What exactly are they accusing me of? The fighting power of the Drizzle Peak was ranked the lowest among the 33 peaks of Cloud Sect. If I don't use some tricks, how can I hope to change that? Mmm, let me think! Right, I have a very simple idea. I will go and tell this boy to save his strength so that he doesn't get the top rank in the entrance exam! Then the other masters won't be upset that I pick a strong disciple, right?"</p>

  <p>"Ah..." the chief examiner had not expected Master Su to come up with such a surprising idea. The idea did not sit well with him!</p>

  <p>Cloud Sect provided the inner and the outer disciples with 33 peaks for cultivating. To stimulate all of the disciples to cultivate hard, Cloud Sect had made a set of very rigorous, scientific rules. The most important rule was about the competition among the 33 peaks.</p>

  <p>The competition affected not only the disciples but also their masters. Each master had their tasks and goals. To produce better disciples, they would naturally scramble for the gifted ones.</p>

  <p>If a person passed both the initial and the entrance exam and showed great talent and strength, every master would be eager to pick that person as their disciple.</p>

  <p>If Master Su broke the rule for the benefit of the Drizzle Peak, she would incur several complaints from the other masters.</p>
