<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Previously, the world around Zheng went by in a blur as he flew for a long time and lost his sense of direction.</p>

  <p>Now, he found the light that Feng Ge had shot did not lead them to the exit of the circular area, but the right side of the said area instead.</p>

  <p>As soon as they arrived at the right side, they immediately calculated the direction. As Feng Ge gently rubbed her thumb against her forefinger, another ray of light extended into the distance.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng flew fast along the ray of light. After a dozen seconds, the pervading white fog no longer surrounded them. It was clear that they had finally passed through.</p>

  <p>However, the woman in the red ball didn't expect that Zheng would be able to get rid of the Mist Killing Array so soon, so she continued to persuade him.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng did not respond to her. Instead, he left with Feng Ge through the exit on one side of the circular ring, then they entered the last area— the flat gobi.</p>

  <p>The moment they entered the gobi, Feng Ge pointed to the distance and exclaimed, "Zheng, look!"</p>

  <p>On the other side of the gobi was a huge temple.</p>

  <p>In addition, the location of the temple was exactly the same as Zheng had predicted before.</p>

  <p>As he gazed into the distance, his eyes quickly fell on a statue in front of the temple.</p>

  <p>The statue looked tall and sturdy, and was dressed in luxurious clothing. Its face seemed to look confident. Zheng had no idea who that was.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Because the Nihility Spirits were quite familiar with the area, it wouldn't be difficult for them to pass through the Mist Killing Array. Naturally, it would be troublesome if those Nihility Spirits caught up with them.</p>

  <p>Judging from how tough it was to pass through the first two areas, Zheng was afraid that the gobi area at the end would give them a hard time, too.</p>

  <p>Since they had been drawn to the white fog while they flew, Zheng and Feng Ge decided that it would be best to walk through the gobi.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>The sounds of their footsteps echoed loudly in the empty gobi as they walked forward.</p>

  <p>Despite having traveled on foot, they moved quite fast. It was only after a blink of an eye when they arrived at the center of the gobi.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng had silently rejoiced about not being in danger anymore, he suddenly felt that the ground beneath him shook.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A huge footprint suddenly appeared on the ground not far away.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before a second footprint followed closely after the first one.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be a giant transparent beast in front of Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Based from the depth of the footprints, the beast's footsteps could definitely crush and kill anyone it stepped on.</p>

  <p>"Step back!" Zheng shouted.</p>

  <p>When he felt a gust of cold wind press down on him, he grabbed Feng Ge and abruptly jumped back.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Another huge footprint landed on the area where they had just been. And a chill ran down Feng Ge's back when she saw it.</p>

  <p>Strangely enough, the footprints stopped appearing when both of them retreated to the first half of the gobi. What was even more strange was that all the footprints in the gobi had vanished. Even the footprints as deep as an abyss were gone as well, and the gobi became flat once again.</p>

  <p>"The footprints didn't follow us," said Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be an invisible giant..." After a moment of thought, Zheng said, "You stay here, while I try again!"</p>

  <p>If he considered the size of the footprint, then the invisible giant shouldn't be that tall.</p>

  <p>He spread his wings and tried to travel through the area in the air.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>When he had reached halfway through, he felt a strong wind blew over his head again.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A huge creature came down from the sky, and then he felt that there was an invisible foot that immediately tried to press him down against the gobi.</p>

  <p>With gritted teeth, he quickly twisted his body and shook his thunder wings, then rolled out from the big foot's side.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The second he jumped out, there was another huge footprint on the ground!</p>

  <p>Swoosh</p>

  <p>Before he could fully come to his senses, a huge foot had stepped on his head.</p>

  <p>His brows knitted in annoyance while he flew forward as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>Every time he avoided a huge foot, he tried his best to fly higher. When he ascended a bit, however, a foot pressed down on him again.</p>

  <p>He went deeper and deeper, and the invisible feet followed him closely.</p>

  <p>It was true that in the beginning, he had guessed that there was a giant in the gobi. Unfortunately, the frequent stomping of the large feet made it clear that there might be hundreds or even a thousand giants that had lined up to trample on him.</p>

  <p>As a result, his flying height lowered repeatedly because of the huge feet.</p>

  <p>He was afraid that he would be killed if he continued to fly forward with difficulty. Therefore, he stopped and retreated as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Once he had left the area, the invisible feet disappeared, and the densely packed footprints were gone and filled in with the sand from the ground.</p>

  <p>Then, he stood next to Feng Ge and lamented helplessly, "I'm afraid we can't break through this area."</p>

  <p>"I think there must be a way," Feng Ge replied and looked around in hopes of finding a clue.</p>

  <p>Yet, the whole place was bare. How would they find any clue?</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng stepped on the ground with a bit of force. A part of the gobi under his feet shattered.</p>

  <p>"I'll try to pass through under the ground," he suggested.</p>

  <p>Although he knew that it was almost impossible to do so, he had no choice but to try, especially when they were chased after. Besides, their destination was right in front of their eyes. He would not give up easily.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he heard that soft voice again that said, "Do not be in vain. How can you pass through the energy souls of heaven and earth in this area?"</p>

  <p>Two red balls appeared at the gobi's entrance. The woman had been searching for a while in the second area, but she couldn't find Zheng. Thus, she went straight into the third area, and saw Zheng and Feng Ge as soon as she arrived.</p>

  <p>The intrusion alerted Zheng and Feng Ge, and both of them quickly paled at the sight of the two balls. They didn't expect that they would catch up so soon!</p>

  <p>"I'll give you one last chance. Engrave these two marks into your bodies, and I can treat you as my own people. Otherwise, I can only kill you without mercy!" the woman in the red ball declared.</p>

  <p>Right after the woman finished speaking, the blood in the red ball circulated, and two masses of blood floated towards Zheng and Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng didn't know what those masses were, he had a rough guess of what could happen if he absorbed them.</p>

  <p>He took a deep breath. There was no way he would submit to the Nihility race, so he would have to fight a hard battle today.</p>

  <p>"Kill us without mercy? Are you sure you're even qualified to speak to me in that way when your strength has been suppressed by Stage Seventeen?"</p>

  <p>Zheng shot back. His body emanated a domineering aura as he spoke intimidatingly.</p>

  <p>He knew that it was difficult to deal with Moon Fire Slaves and Nihility Spirits, so he had tried to dodge them when he could. However, things were different when he had no route of retreat.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity to kill such a talent..." the woman in the red ball sighed when she felt Zheng's aura.</p>

  <p>At that point, she said to the Nihility Spirit by her side, "Go ahead. Capture the man alive, while the woman could be killed."</p>

  <p>Immediately after, the surface of the two red balls began to fluctuate in circles.</p>

  <p>The minute they were about to take action, the Moon Fire Slaves suddenly appeared behind the Nihility Spirits. As soon as No. 13 arrived at the gobi, his huge body suddenly turned around and crushed a Nihility Spirit under his feet.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The conflict between the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race was unresolvable. They were mortal enemies. Of course, they would not hold back in each other's presence.</p>
