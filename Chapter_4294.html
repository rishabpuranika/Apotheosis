<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The downgrader's eyes suddenly widened in realization. He discovered that the golden ring was under attack, and it already got damaged!</p>

  <p>The golden ring, also known as the Narrow Steel Ring in the Deep Space, was an immensely powerful defensive treasure invented by a genius of the Cinnabar race. Even the downgrader was amazed when he first saw it. He was awed by the inventor's wisdom and the fact that he managed to create such a powerful treasure with the Extreme Form energy.</p>

  <p>After the downgrader had obtained the irregular heavy sword, he used the Extreme Form energy to build the Narrow Steel Ring. However, it was a pity that he was not in the Deep Space right now. That was because the creation of Narrow Steel Rings required some specific techniques and materials from the Deep Space. Therefore, the downgrader could only make a simplified version.</p>

  <p>Yet, although he had only made a simplified Narrow Steel Ring, it still had a spectacular defensive ability. It should've been impossible to damage it with just a single blow!</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" the Snake Spirit King asked curiously. He could not understand why the downgrader felt worried when everything was well under their control.</p>

  <p>"Someone is trying to destroy your coordinates and my Source Light..." the downgrader answered.</p>

  <p>"What? But how could that happen?" the Snake Spirit King said in disbelief while he subconsciously began to think about the possible answers. As he did so, his omniscient abilities immediately conveyed all the relevant information to him.</p>

  <p>It included the inner thoughts of the people on the jadeite platform, the reason why Luo Nian continued to attack his avatars in vain, as well as Luo Zheng's current location.</p>

  <p>As the information flashed in his mind, he saw Luo Zheng, who thrust a purple spear towards the golden ring. After he did that, numerous cracks appeared on the ring's surface.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>With a crisp sound, the cracks immediately spread to the entire body of the Narrow Steel Ring. If Luo Zheng thrust the spear once more, the Narrow Steel Ring would undoubtedly break into pieces!</p>

  <p>"Stop!" the Snake Spirit King yelled, his face blanched in fright. He quickly attempted to teleport himself beside Luo Zheng to block the spear.</p>

  <p>The downgrader's reflexes were much faster than the Snake Spirit King's.</p>

  <p>However, he needed a longer time to use the Grand Teleportation technique, since the Burial Land had been handed over to the Snake Spirit King. As a result, they did things almost simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Just as both of them were about to teleport away at the same time, two avatars of Luo Zheng suddenly appeared behind them.</p>

  <p>"Exile!"</p>

  <p>In a split second, two cubic spaces enveloped the downgrader and the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>They felt their heads spin for a moment, then they got sent out of the Burial Land at the same time and found themselves floating somewhere else in the chaos.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>In turn, the downgrader's six pairs of compound eyes instantly turned bright red. He quickly understood the situation and spiraled into a flurry of emotions.</p>

  <p>"It's Luo Zheng... He could control the Burial Land?!"</p>

  <p>It was not until the Snake Spirit King got kicked out of the Burial Land that he realized what happened.</p>

  <p>"Stop him, my avatar!"</p>

  <p>Since they got sent quite far away, it was not easy for the Snake Spirit King to go back. Thus, he immediately created an avatar beside Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But before his avatar could stop Luo Zheng, the purple spear which was formed from the Destruction Extreme Form energy had already stabbed the Narrow Steel Ring.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Covered in cracks, the Narrow Steel Ring finally broke apart at that one thrust.</p>

  <p>As a defensive treasure, it was already impressive enough to have withstood three blows of the Destruction Extreme Form energy before it finally shattered.</p>

  <p>However, the long spear did not stop even after it broke the Narrow Steel Ring. Next, it pierced through the black orb of light and punctured the coordinates.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The moment the coordinates, which were two golden crosses, came into contact with the Destruction Extreme Form energy, they instantly turned into a heap of fine golden powder.</p>

  <p>The poor Snake Spirit King had sensed everything through his connection to the Burial Land. He even knew how many pieces his coordinates had broken into, but he could not stop it from happening. He could only watch helplessly in a daze. If he could not do anything, then what use were his omniscient abilities?</p>

  <p>"Help, help me..." On the brink of death, the Snake Spirit King desperately asked the downgrader for help.</p>

  <p>"You died of stupidity," the downgrader only remarked mockingly.</p>

  <p>"I... I..."</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King failed to finish his sentence, as his body slowly became snow-white in color, then a translucent shade. Eventually, he completely disappeared from the downgrader's vision.</p>

  <p>The chief culprit behind the destruction of the main world and the one who had brought the Four Spirits Sect to its end finally died in this way.</p>

  <p>After he died, his avatars could no longer move, as if they had lost their souls.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng stretched out his hand and stabbed the avatar's body with the purple spear, which blasted it into pieces. His lips curved into a relieved smile.</p>

  <p>On the jadeite platform, the Snake Spirit King's avatars originally kept forming in succession before Luo Nian quickly killed them. Just as Luo Nian began to worry that his physical strength could not hold on for longer, the avatars suddenly stopped appearing.</p>

  <p>Did Luo Zheng succeed?</p>

  <p>Or did the Snake Spirit King just give up wasting his time fighting with Luo Nian?</p>

  <p>A moment of silence later, everyone turned to look at Luo Zheng's avatar. They knew this avatar was connected to Luo Zheng's consciousness.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! How's it going now?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>Everyone on the jadeite platform went silent and eagerly waited for Luo Zheng's avatar to answer.</p>

  <p>The avatar paused for a few seconds before the corners of his mouth curved up into a smile. "I have removed the Snake Spirit King's coordinates," he said.</p>

  <p>Kincaid, Hilario, the Snake Goddess, Luo Nian, Tianming, and the human heroes' energy souls all felt stunned for a moment ? then they jumped in joy.</p>

  <p>"He really made it!"</p>

  <p>"It was easier than I expected!"</p>

  <p>"As the saying goes, 'the smarter one will win in an inevitable confrontation.' Because they were both world rulers, this fight quickly yielded results!"</p>

  <p>The crux of the battle between the world rulers lay on seizing the advantage of time. It was especially important for Luo Zheng to have obtained the most crucial information from Barth, and the Snake Goddess' suggestion was no less significant.</p>

  <p>As the others celebrated, Itzel looked relaxed. Her father, who had remained one of her worst nightmares, was finally gone. Her curse that had lasted for over a thousand chaotic eras came to an end at last.</p>

  <p>While everyone basked in their excitement, Luo Zheng added, "Although his coordinates have gotten destroyed, the orb of black light still exists. I can't eliminate it..."</p>

  <p>Everyone on the jadeite platform felt very optimistic already, but their happiness did not last long when Luo Zheng pointed out the graver issue. Then, they became serious once again.</p>

  <p>They had not forgotten the fact that the downgrader remained their biggest threat.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the mountain, different rings flashed in Luo Zheng's palms one after another.</p>

  <p>He tried every kind of Extreme Form energy in succession, but none of them worked to affect the black light.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A white ring released a blazing beam of light, which melted the entire mountain right away. However, the black light was still undamaged.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, why don't you try to exclude that entire area from the land?" the Snake Goddess advised his avatar, who was on the jadeite platform.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng's eyes lit up as a blue ring materialized in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Hyperspace Extreme Form!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A space of ten miles in length, width, and height appeared in a particular area. This space was completely isolated from the primitive land.</p>

  <p>"Exile!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng tried to exile everything in this specific space, including the black light.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, this entire space should have gotten exiled into somewhere else in the chaos. However, the black light still floated in its original position and did not even move an inch at all.</p>

  <p>A headache began to brew in Luo Zheng's head. This thing was a tougher challenge than he had imagined!</p>

  <p>"Ancestry-level bloodline... Do you have any idea?" he asked helplessly.</p>

  <p>Although the ancestry-level bloodline had been busy dealing with the crystal, it had also paid attention to Luo Zheng's movements. Of course, it had also noticed the black light earlier.</p>

  <p>"When we were in the Jade Pure Realm, I noticed something familiar in this orb of black light," said the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"What's it?" Luo Zheng asked hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell. My relevant memories were lost. Perhaps we can find the answer in the crystal," the ancestry-level bloodline answered.</p>

  <p>"Alright..."</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng communicated with the ancestry-level bloodline, his eyes remained transfixed on the black light. As he looked closely at it, he began to feel a strange sensation. He felt as if someone was staring back at him in the black light.</p>

  <p>The second he was about to speak, he heard the downgrader's laughter from within the black light.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Have you found me? You have sharper eyes than I thought!"</p>
