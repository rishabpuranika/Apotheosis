<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2916 Bathe In The Holy Spring </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>From the viewpoint of the Yellow Emperor Guards, the divine land looked as if it was only a little bit larger than a grain of sand. But, nestled in the middle of a grayish brown, it remained a sight to behold.</p>

  <p>"Look at that beauty!" Godfrey exclaimed as he stared at the vast divine land before him.</p>

  <p>"Chiyou took a lot of efforts to create this world," Clement remarked nonchalantly. "Of course it won't be ordinary."</p>

  <p>Another person assessed the distance between them and the divine land.</p>

  <p>"With the current speed of the Trumpet Flying Ship," he concluded, "we'd need roughly five days to reach it."</p>

  <p>The vastness of the chaos was intense.</p>

  <p>While the divine land was already at their line of sight, it would still take them a while to reach it.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, get ready," Clement announced. "We may need to face fierce battles after five days. How many divine crystals do we have on this Trumpet Flying Ship?"</p>

  <p>"Around three hundred," Godfrey reported. "That's enough for us to return."</p>

  <p>"Use all these divine crystals to prepare the Slaughtering Moonlight Array,"</p>

  <p>Clement ordered.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards exchanged surprise glances. Godfrey was the one to say what was on everyone's minds. "If we consume all of the divine crystals," he started. "How are we going to go back? We don't need the Slaughtering Moonlight Array to kill those Other Shore Realm warriors, do we?"</p>

  <p>Clement shook his head. "Do as what I said. Just to be on the safe side. I have the feeling that we'll have a tough battle ahead of us. Besides, if we successfully occupy the divine land, it would have the resources we need to return."</p>

  <p>Even without the Trumpet Flying Ship, they could still return to the Source World. It would just take a longer time.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Mountain of Holy Beings,.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was rushing towards the silver water pool again.</p>

  <p>This time, ten figures emerged from the water.</p>

  <p>The ten silver men were of great power, yet they were unable to cause any substantial damage to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Golden light shot out of Luo Zheng's body and it tore the silver men into pieces.</p>

  <p>It took several rounds for Luo Zheng to realize that the fighting strategy of the silver men in the holy spring was the same as that of the person who attacked them.</p>

  <p>For one, the silver men used swords to attack Sword Chen just as what he did. And the Divine Dao they used was exactly the same as Sword Chen's.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng relied on his fists and own strength to fight the silver men and, similarly, the silver men dealt with him only with brute force.</p>

  <p>The other Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods also knew this, but they did not hesitate to use their most powerful skills against these silver men.</p>

  <p>They knew full well that their bodies weren't as tough as Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>If they relied only on their fists and own strength to fight the silver men all at the same time, they would sure be shattered to pieces.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, only relied on the golden light that contained Truth of Divine Dao in the surface of his body. However, the silver men were unable to use the Truth of Divine Dao which Luo Zheng's body generated.</p>

  <p>With this technique, it was much easier for Luo Zheng to deal with them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was smart enough not to use a sword. The silver men could also blend the Divine Dao, even if they couldn't use the Truth of Divine Dao that Luo Zheng employed. The three thousand Divine Dao existed in the divine land, after all.</p>

  <p>He had the option of holding the Soaring Snake Sword and using the token of blending the Divine Dao to combat the silver men, but that could put him in trouble. Even Luo Zheng couldn't resist the backlash of the Ways-blending Energy.</p>

  <p>Once more, he rushed to the silver pool and was thrown by the backlash of his attack that shattered his enemies to pieces. This went on over and over again.</p>

  <p>Each time they disintegrated, the silver men would re-appear in more numbers in the next round. When they reached thirty and Luo Zheng was able to crush them once more, the water finally calmed down as the silver men were unable to regenerate.</p>

  <p>"I did it!" Luo Zheng said triumphantly.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the pool, silver water gushed out.</p>

  <p>As far as Luo Zheng knew, he only needed to bathe in the holy spring.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made his way to the middle of the holy spring.</p>

  <p>Not far away, several consummate True Gods gave up the fight. They had already lost their arms, broken their legs, or were badly injured. They stared at the holy springs ahead of them in defeat.</p>

  <p>They had to face powerful silver men and, potentially, sneak attacks from some Demi-holy Beings when they rushed for the chance to bathe in the holy springs. Unfortunately, they were too weak to continue.</p>

  <p>If they weren't careful enough, they would end up dead!</p>

  <p>"Haha!"</p>

  <p>On the side of a holy spring, a Demi-holy Being could be seen fighting three silver men when something cold brushed past the Demi-holy Being's back.</p>

  <p>It was an ice sword that cut across his head.</p>

  <p>The Demi-holy Being's head flew to the sky as the ice sword shot a beam of cold light. As soon as the cold light hit the head, a fist landed on the head, and it immediately turned into shards of ice.</p>

  <p>The one who made the attack was a consummate True God from the Leng Clan, Glendon Leng.</p>

  <p>Glendon Leng was not well-known on the Floating Islands, but he had astounding power and strength. When the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands explored the Abyss Demon Region not too long ago, he had explored the north of the divine land alone and conquered a second grade forbidden land, the Dream Ice Plain, where he found the ice sword, a second grade supreme treasure of belief!</p>

  <p>"Glendon killed another person."</p>

  <p>"He's already responsible for nine deaths!"</p>

  <p>"How could it be so easy for a consummate True God to kill a Demi-holy Being? Glendon is so strong!"</p>

  <p>"What's the big deal of it? No one would dare provoke the two that monopolized the holy springs over there, after all."</p>

  <p>The two people the man referred to were Luo Zheng and Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>The people who decided to sit by the sidelines and give up on the fight let out a collective sigh.</p>

  <p>They wanted to become Holy Beings, but they were too weak and they were not ready to sacrifice their lives for nothing.</p>

  <p>As soon as Glendon Leng was sure that the Demi-holy Being was dead, he snuck to the other Demi-Holy Being. It was Leland.</p>

  <p>Leland was standing by the other side of the holy spring. His body lit with colorful lights as he moved steady towards the holy spring.</p>

  <p>His speed of approaching the holy spring was rather fast as he now was faced with six silver men.</p>

  <p>The moment Glendon Leng rushed over, he felt a chill.</p>

  <p>Leland was trained to be more vigilant than ordinary Demi-holy Beings, thanks to his experience in the Abyss Demon Region. As soon as he felt the chill, he bent down.</p>

  <p>Because of his quick response, the ice sword missed his scalp by a short distance.</p>

  <p>Glendon Leng clenched his fist in frustration; he had failed to hit Leland with his sword strike. He breathed deeply and decided to strike again.</p>

  <p>However, Leland was already floating backward and had avoided the second sword strike from Glendon Leng. At the same time, he quickly distanced himself from the holy spring.</p>

  <p>Glendon Leng didn't chase after him. Leland wasn't his primary target anyway. His goal was to kill all the competitors so that he could bathe in the holy spring in peace.</p>

  <p>Leland successfully retreated to a thousand feet away. He looked at the scene and smiled bitterly. 'These disciples of the powerful clans are too aggressive, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Just then, Leland heard someone cry loudly close by.</p>

  <p>"Look! Luo Zheng moved so fast. He has started bathing in the holy spring!"</p>

  <p>"Another Holy Being is about to be born!"</p>

  <p>"Holy crap! His strength has already surpassed that of a Holy Being! He deserves to gain the title of a Holy Being!"</p>

  <p>People talked among themselves with eyes full of envy.</p>

  <p>Then, the envy in their eyes disappeared as soon as they all realized something. "Something's wrong," someone finally said. "It seems like the holy spring failed to integrate into Luo Zheng's body. That's strange."</p>
