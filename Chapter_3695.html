<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>The disciples in the Flow Sword Sect had also witnessed the groundbreaking scene.</p>

  <p>They watched as the two giant figures of Emperor Charm and Eastern Emperor Taiyi fought fiercely— the sun versus the Golden Rune Sword, respectively.</p>

  <p>Anxiously they rooted for their own leader, Eastern Emperor Taiyi. They hated to think about the consequences if he lost.</p>

  <p>Trish and Carrie kept on heading outside the courtyard house to inquire if there was any news.</p>

  <p>Yudie, however, decided to err on the side of caution and refused to leave the courtyard house.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Margaret was surprisingly calm. She only asked about Zheng a few times, concerned for her husband's safety. She didn't concern herself with other matters from the outside.</p>

  <p>The people in the courtyard continued to feel the earth quake as the battle raged on below. Initially, the ground trembled ever so slightly, but to their surprise, after a while, it felt like the whole mountain was sliding down!</p>

  <p>What would become of them if the huge mountain crashed?</p>

  <p>If it ever came to that, while the disciples of the three sects could easily flee by flying into the sky, they were still worried.</p>

  <p>To their relief, the sliding of the mountain lasted only for a short while, and then they felt the ground beneath their feet stabilize once more.</p>

  <p>Trish went out to inquire about the matter again and found out that the war in the Oneness Sky Palace had subsided. Relieved, she eagerly returned to relay the news to the others.</p>

  <p>Just then, Zheng landed in the courtyard. When the women saw Zheng, joy filled their faces as they rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>Although they believed that Zheng would return to them in one piece, they had been worried since the Oneness Sky Palace was almost destroyed.</p>

  <p>When they knew their beloved husband was facing powerful warriors of the Sun Crow race, there was nothing they could do but silently pray for his safety.</p>

  <p>Thus, seeing him return to them unharmed was a huge relief.</p>

  <p>After Zheng, Yudie, Margaret and the other girls had settled down, Edna quietly walked out from a corner and asked in a low voice, "Creator, is the Evil God safe?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had corrected her several times before, telling her not to call him "Creator". It seemed, however, that she was incapable of changing her ways.</p>

  <p>At the mention of the Evil God, Zheng frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>While Edna saw his abrupt change in expression, her heart sank. Could it be that the Evil God had died?</p>

  <p>She knew that her husband had already been refined into an Inner-world Generating Avatar, which was equivalent to Zheng's avatar puppet. In this case, no matter how powerful the Evil God was, it would be difficult for him to betray Zheng. He was most likely dead...</p>

  <p>Edna was fully prepared to accept this.</p>

  <p>"He has escaped," Zheng said helplessly, his frown deepening.</p>

  <p>"Escaped?" she echoed in surprise. "How is that possible..."</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged.</p>

  <p>The fact that the Evil God was able to escape was purely an accident. In theory, it was impossible for the Evil God to disobey Zheng's orders.</p>

  <p>However, when he was faced with the creatures he wasn't able to kill, he was able to flee, taking advantage of Zheng's order to prioritize his freedom.</p>

  <p>"Sorry..."</p>

  <p>Edna apologized, her face full of shock.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head. "It's not your fault. I was negligent. Don't worry. I'll find him sooner or later."</p>

  <p>Zheng knew that even if the Evil God had found a way to escape, he was still his Inner-world Generating Avatar.</p>

  <p>If they met each other one day, as long as they were close enough in proximity, the Evil God wouldn't be able to disobey Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Then, can I return to your inner world?" Edna asked.</p>

  <p>She considered leaving his inner world as a gift from Zheng. Now that the Evil God had wronged him, she felt that she didn't deserve this gift.</p>

  <p>She knew that the Evil God would always find ways to disobey Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, she also was under the impression that the Inner-world Generating Avatar was strong enough to suppress the Evil God. She never thought he'd be able to run away like this. Thinking about this made her uneasy.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at Edna indifferently. "I came back here to take Tia, Margaret, and Aura back to the inner world. If you don't want to return with them, I won't force you."</p>

  <p>There was no Rebirth Land for Edna in Zheng's inner world. Once she left, it was impossible to find she back.</p>

  <p>"But," he continued, "the Source World is not peaceful recently. If you travel alone in this world, the chances of finding the Evil God are very small."</p>

  <p>Edna was considered one of the top warriors in Zheng's inner world, but in the Source World, she was quite weak. With her talent, it was possible she would be able to reach the Other Shore Realm, but it was still a futile mission.</p>

  <p>Hearing Zheng's words, Edna was stunned for a moment. Then, her eyes lit up excitedly, like a prisoner who had seen the sun for the first time in years...</p>

  <p>"Creator, are you willing to let me go?"</p>

  <p>"If that's what you want, I won't stop you," Zheng repeated.</p>

  <p>"Then, I want to leave!" Edna said firmly.</p>

  <p>She could stay in Zheng's inner world and wait for the Evil God to return, but what she really wanted was to search for him. No matter how dangerous it was, she didn't care.</p>

  <p>"But my children are still in your inner world..." Although she loved the Evil God, their ways were different. As a mother, she cared for her children deeply.</p>

  <p>"I won't interfere with the development of my inner world. I believe you know that," Zheng replied indifferently.</p>

  <p>In most cases, Zheng would allow his inner world to evolve, and he wouldn't interfere anything unless someone as reckless as Evil God appeared.</p>

  <p>Edna nodded. She felt reassured. Her Creator was a man of his word, after all. Without further hesitation, she took her leave. Now that the Oneness Sky Palace was recovering from the turmoil of war, the chances of someone stopping her were slim.</p>

  <p>"I've already brought Xun and the others into my inner world. You can also stay there to avoid any danger. Especially you, Margaret. You need a peaceful environment," Zheng said, turning to face her.</p>

  <p>Margaret must've changed a lot while he was gone. She nodded meekly, with no objections.</p>

  <p>When they heard that Zheng was going to take the women into his inner world, Trish and Carrie exchanged worried glances.</p>

  <p>In the past few years, Zheng's status in the Oneness Sky Palace climbed each day. Consequently, as his maids, Trish's and Carrie's status had also been elevated— at least, among the rest of the maids of the Flow Sword Sect.</p>

  <p>Even the other disciples were courteous to them. They had never experienced such respect before Zheng came into their lives.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the two of them had silently agreed that they would devote their lives to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now that Zheng was gathering his family to move them back to his inner world, the two maids felt uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Luo, are you not coming back to the Flow Sword Sect?" Trish asked boldly.</p>

  <p>Zheng glanced at Trish and realized shamefacedly that he had completely ignored the two maids.</p>

  <p>"The Oneness Sky Palace is not peaceful now," he said carefully. "If you two are willing to enter my inner world, you can also..."</p>

  <p>Zheng was still a little hesitant. After all, the two maids were born in the Source World; he was afraid they wouldn't be willing to live in a small inner world.</p>

  <p>Yet, to his surprise, before he could even finish speaking, Trish and Carrie shouted in unison, "That would be great!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that they couldn't wait to enter his inner world, Zheng realized that his hesitation was unnecessary.</p>
