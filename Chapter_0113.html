<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The two halberds were more likely to penetrate Luo Zheng even though his body was a powerful spiritual weapon, resulting in Luo Zheng being severely wounded or worse.</p>

  <p>But, Luo Zheng was able to sense the positions of both White Fiend and Black Fiend, which upset the coordinated efforts of the two evils.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng's eyes flew open, and he moved a step to the right.</p>

  <p>After skillfully dodging the attack, Luo Zheng hurled the broken flying knife at the Black Fiend.</p>

  <p>Not expecting Luo Zheng to have the ability to discover where he was, the Black Fiend used the halberd to defend himself.</p>

  <p>The halberd was a top-grade mysterious weapon and when the two of them attacked people together, their power could be equal to that of a spiritual weapon. Black Fiend lifted the one in his hands to parry the incoming attack from Zheng's flying knife.</p>

  <p>Regrettably, the Black Fiend underestimated the power and strength of the broken flying knife.</p>

  <p>As the two weapons collided, the halberd was halved, and the knife continued to fly to its original target, the Black Fiend.</p>

  <p>With his head separating from his neck, the Black Fiend's final thoughts were a mass of confusion, 'How did Luo Zheng discover me...?</p>

  <p>How is that blade so strong...?' as he lay there, the Black Fiend faded and questioned everything.</p>

  <p>"No! Black Fiend!"</p>

  <p>Shrouded in mist, the White Fiend hollered in anger at the sight of his partner dying at Zheng's hands and vengefully sent the halberd hurtling at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Having already penetrated the veil of invisibility cloaking the White Fiend, Luo Zheng dodged his attack easily.</p>

  <p>Realizing he was at a disadvantage, the White Fiend decided to conceal himself amid the mists and waited for the right moment to destroy Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Without mercy, Luo Zheng stabbed her utilizing his soul strength.</p>

  <p>Filled with excruciating pain, the White Fiend fell over. His neck was severed and he surrendered to the power of the broken flying knife.</p>

  <p>The two evils perished in combat!</p>

  <p>Shortly afterward, the black and white mists, along with the life vitality that brought them to be, began to disperse slowly.....</p>

  <p>In front of the Green Haze group, Martin stood, staring at the vast expanse of mist fearfully.</p>

  <p>Fully aware that there was a fierce battle between two evils and Luo Zheng beside him, Martin was concerned when all he could see was mist.</p>

  <p>Although he was confident in Zheng's martial art skills, he didn't think Luo Zheng had a chance winning because the gulf between Zheng's expertise and his foes' was overwhelming.</p>

  <p>However, gradually, the mist dissipated and Luo Zheng came into view, standing near the remains of his two opponents.</p>

  <p>Emerging the victor was Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>Sighing in relief, Martin admired Zheng's ingenuity and ability to create consecutive miracles.....</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Martin realized Luo Zheng could defeat him with a single blow.....</p>

  <p>However, he thought it was reasonable and he could accept the fact.</p>

  <p>As soon as he saw the severed heads of the two evils, Liam's shocked panic paralyzed him.</p>

  <p>His entire body was racked with violent, uncontrollable shuddering.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng walking in his direction carrying the halberds, Liam fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Fear filled his widened eyes.</p>

  <p>"Stop Luo Zheng!" he shouted as his limbs shuddered out of control.</p>

  <p>"Why? Aren't you dying to kill me?</p>

  <p>Dying to doom me?</p>

  <p>Didn't you say, you wanted to finish me off, here, at the Dragon Fort?" taunted Luo Zheng while he glared down at Liam!</p>

  <p>"I did say that, but, only because of the orders that Fren gave! Please, Luo Zheng, spare me!" begged Liam. Facing Luo Zheng now, he lost his bravado.</p>

  <p>"I would have spared you because of our shared fellowship, but, you were intent on killing me here, at the Dragon Fort. There's no way for me to justify sparing you!" warned Luo Zheng as he pointed his broken flying knife menacingly at Liam.</p>

  <p>"I... I am nothing! A beast without human feelings..." Liam whimpered as he groveled, prostrating himself before Luo Zheng until blood covered his forehead.</p>

  <p>Softening somewhat, Zheng's heart was moved by Liam's suffering.</p>

  <p>Raised in a scholarly family, Luo Zheng was gentle by nature, though he'd come to realize that by killing, all disputes ended.</p>

  <p>But, killing still was not a way he liked.</p>

  <p>A glimmer of mercy crept into Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>In that instant, Liam triggered his golden needle, sending it at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Ppffft!" came the sound as the golden needle whizzed through the air, making its way to Luo Zheng at tremendous speed.</p>

  <p>Granted, Luo Zheng had a body similar to a spiritual weapon, but it didn't stop the golden needle from piercing his skin and lodging firmly in his chest.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, that was the Strychnos Thorn. It was made by an expert at forging poisonous needles in the Zhu Clan. And now, you're as good as dead!" exclaimed Liam full of exuberance after landing his unexpected blow.</p>

  <p>Removing the golden needle effortlessly, Luo Zheng said, "This secret weapon is famed throughout the Eastern Region, but..... it won't bring my death!"</p>

  <p>"Ping, ting-ting-ting-ting!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng dropped the needle on the ground. It clacked as it rebounded, clattering against the ground a few times before coming to a stop. Luo Zheng grinned.</p>

  <p>"But? How? You.....!" staring up at Luo Zheng, Liam's confusion mounted, and he demanded, "Anyone poisoned by the Strychnos Thorn dies! How is it you are an exception!?"</p>

  <p>Shaking his head, Luo Zheng replied, "That's a secret that you don't need to know since you're done for!"</p>

  <p>Almost the second that the broken flying knife left Zheng's hand, poor Liam's neck was parted from his head. After looking down at his dead enemy, Luo Zheng turned and left without looking back.</p>

  <p>Notorious for its remarkable fatality rates, the strychnos poison would be ejected from a hidden weapon to kill rivals even at the nature level.</p>

  <p>Even though Roger was at the nature level, if Liam had attacked him, Roger would die on the spot.</p>

  <p>But, Luo Zheng was blessed with a superhuman ability and was invulnerable to poisons.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng walked away, a chilliness greeted him.</p>

  <p>The chilly force spread, covering the ground and freezing everything, including the plants, rocks, and soil as it moved past them.</p>

  <p>Heading at Luo Zheng, the chilly force raced along.</p>

  <p>A chill touched Zheng's feet causing him to jump to one side.</p>

  <p>"Cre-ka-rack!" crackling noises rose as ice crystals covered with thorns fanned out in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The crystalline blossom was striking in appearance but fatal by nature.</p>

  <p>Had Luo Zheng not evaded it in time, it would have impaled him.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Luo Zheng suspected that this was Randall's doing.</p>

  <p>Several of the trees ahead were snow-white.</p>

  <p>There was a misty pine up ahead. Usually, misty pine was matched with the weather around it, so that on the coldest of days, it reflected that.</p>

  <p>Ahead, it performed a beautiful winter scene, which was an abnormal sign, indeed.</p>

  <p>Randall appeared from behind an icy tree.</p>

  <p>"Are you presuming that you'll manage to leave the Dragon Fort, alive?" asked Randall as he stepped closer to Luo Zheng. His steps were deliberate, slow, as snowflakes fell around him. Randall scoffed, "At sixteen, I joined the Imperial Army. I rose in fame and rank by my abilities, only to be humiliated by you, a brat. That alone gives me a good reason to kill you here!"</p>

  <p>Giving a slight shake of the head as he grinned, Luo Zheng returned, "I'm ready for your assault at any time you want to try!"</p>

  <p>"I promise if you don't resist, I'll kill you swiftly!" said Randall while his life vitality began to move, shaping itself into a long and ice-encrusted spear.</p>

  <p>With his heart thumping, Zheng's first inclination was to run.</p>

  <p>Refiners at the nature level could be divided into ten ranks according to their power. Each rank was disproportionately more powerful than the last.</p>

  <p>Presently, Randall was a leading master, blessed with rank four in the nature level of refining. With that level, he was bound to be able to defeat Luo Zheng, who was only at the marrow refining level.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to attempt to run away from my fatal strike, Luo Zheng?" ridiculed Randall, grinning as he took a step, just as Luo Zheng made his way to escape. Where Randall stepped, the ground became covered with ice.</p>

  <p>As Randall ran, the ground iced over and was in constant motion.</p>

  <p>Actually, Randall wasn't running. He was skiing over the surface.</p>

  <p>It didn't take much effort to overtake Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Randall was nearly on Luo Zheng, he stopped to aim his icy spear and launched it at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The icy spear whizzed along the air at Luo Zheng as fast as the golden needle that Liam had sent at him earlier.</p>

  <p>Sensing the threat behind him, Luo Zheng was about to turn and dodge it, but that proved to be a futile move.</p>

  <p>"Swoo-oosh!" as the spear sliced the air, it passed Zheng's shoulder, the razor-like tip shredding his tunic and cutting into his skin as it flew. Blood spurted like a geyser from the fresh wound.</p>

  <p>'Randall's prowess is worthy of his reputation in martial arts!' Luo Zheng admired his rival's talent silently.</p>

  <p>Glancing at the graze on his shoulder, Luo Zheng knew he had barely managed to escape death. Randall's ability and force were, indeed, a threat to take seriously.</p>

  <p>But, Luo Zheng had a few tricks up his sleeve still.</p>

  <p>In an earlier battle, when he went against the queen blade locust, Luo Zheng wasn't able to counter her strikes as he could now.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had a secret weapon that would turn the tables in his favor.</p>

  <p>As Randall drew nearer, Luo Zheng volleyed his broken flying knife, throwing it behind him, at his antagonist.</p>

  <p>During Zheng's encounter with the two evils, the mist was so thick that Randall couldn't see, so he was unaware of the might of Zheng's secret weapon.</p>

  <p>Smirking when he saw the paltry attack Luo Zheng sent his way, Randall waved his hand to form an icy shield.</p>

  <p>His blunder was classic. Considering a mysterious weapon couldn't endure the impact of the broken flying knife, there was no hope in his icy shield surviving. The shield shattered as the knife hit it, leaving Randall's forehead vulnerable.</p>

  <p>Caught off guard, Randall barely had time to duck and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>While Randall might have been Zheng's superior at the martial arts level, he was left humbled beyond measure.</p>

  <p>His humiliation magnified at tenfold being overwhelmed like this by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Randall flew into a rage, as the blue veins became visible and were bulging on his forehead. "Luo Zheng, that was an underhanded move, and sooner or later, I will make you suffer for this!"</p>
