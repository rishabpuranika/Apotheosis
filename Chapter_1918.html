<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Holy Drew was becoming more and more excited. His single eye shone brightly as he tried to understand what had happened to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He ripped open his clothes, revealing his lean and taut body. He then grabbed the wine jug and swallowed a big gulp, before spraying it on Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>In fact, even after arduously working for such a long time, he had only completed the first step of refining, which was tempering.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng's physical body was a human-shaped weapon, there was no need to rework on his appearance.</p>

  <p>Of course, if Luo Zheng wanted to change his physical body into another shape, it would be as easy as lifting a finger for Holy Drew.</p>

  <p>The liquid in the wine jug was the most famous Sunrest Wood Spring in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The four divine trees in the divine land all had their own unique characteristics. The Ray Tree, which was located in the east, was full of vitality, towering at a height of 300 million feet. There were thirteen races residing on the tree, and the most famous one was the Butterfly race. When one entered the Ray Tree, they could smell the fragrance of various types of flowers. It was refreshing and at the same time intoxicating.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Tree, which was in the north, looked like a bare wooden pole.</p>

  <p>It was taller than the Ray Tree, with only one pillar soaring into the sky.</p>

  <p>The Hidden Tree, which was in the south, was comparatively shorter. It looked similar to a banyan tree, constantly expanding its roots. The branches of the tree extended in all directions like vines, and the area they covered was very extensive.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Tree, which was in the west, was born at the edge of an endless sea. This tree was as high as the Ray Tree, and the only difference was that the huge trunk of the tree floated on the sea, looking like an island.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Wood Spring was located in the middle of the trunk. A pot of spring would be collected in every hundred years.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Wood Spring was considered like an elixir within the divine land. It could be used for medicinal purposes, and it was mostly loved and craved for by the numerous weapon refiners of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Wood Spring contained rich life energy. At times, the inner world of some martial artists would be too weak. During such times, even if one constantly struck it with the Thunder of Life, it would be difficult for it to give birth to new life. But if one placed the Sunrest Wood Spring within the inner world, it could easily do the job.</p>

  <p>For the people in the divine land, a hundred years passed in just a blink of an eye. For True Gods who had eternal lifespan, time was not an issue.</p>

  <p>However, there was always an insatiable demand for the Sunrest Wood Spring. Hence it was not an easy task to obtain it.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure success at the current task, Holy Drew had not been stingy with his collection of the elixir and offered up an entire pot of Sunrest Wood Spring.</p>

  <p>The golden hammer of Holy Drew smashed into Zheng's body more than a thousand times. All this while, Zheng's body blazed with golden brilliance.</p>

  <p>The golden Sanskrit words were like a black hole, continuously devouring the surrounding green flames.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was in a completely numbed state. He could only lie on the ground and watch as the one-eyed man used different methods to refine him.</p>

  <p>The Sunrest Wood Spring in the wine jug was completely used up. Holy Drew casually threw away the wine jug and grabbed Zheng's arm, pulling him up from the ground. His one eye was continuously observing Luo Zheng as he pinched his arm.</p>

  <p>"It's not enough," Holy Drew said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>The tempering was a rather important step, and it was because of the repeated tempering and the cleansing of the primordial energy that Zheng's body continued to grow stronger and stronger.</p>

  <p>However, this was only the first step. It was like laying the foundation for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Judging from Holy Drew's expression, it was obvious that he was not too satisfied with this result.</p>

  <p>Standing on the spot, Holy Drew considered for a moment and then said with a faint smile, "You are an interesting challenge and I am definitely going to use everything in my power to refine you."</p>

  <p>As per his promise to Holy Jay, he only had to refine Zheng's body thoroughly. However, during the process, Holy Drew's curiosity was aroused. Luo Zheng was just like a sword embryo filled with endless possibilities. Holy Drew wanted to refine a weapon that was worthy of his pride.</p>

  <p>In these past few years, he had indeed refined quite a few supreme chaotic weapons, and there was no lack of some unrivalled ones.</p>

  <p>Moreover, in the entire divine land, only he and his two personal disciples were capable of refining the supreme chaotic weapons.</p>

  <p>However, over the years, Holy Drew had lost his pursuit.</p>

  <p>Just like a martial artist's dream was to explore the world of martial arts, a weapon refiner also wished to explore further possibilities of refinement.</p>

  <p>The peak was not the end. This world was filled with infinite possibilities, just waiting to be explored.</p>

  <p>However, it was definitely a tough job to achieve a breakthrough in the world of weapon refining.</p>

  <p>Even the best supreme chaotic weapons built by Holy Drew had yet to fully display the power of chaotic energy. After all, Holy Drew's understanding of chaos was quite limited.</p>

  <p>But now the situation was different.</p>

  <p>From what Holy Jay had said, this little fellow lying in front of him had created his inner world using chaotic energy. From a certain point of view, Luo Zheng had already controlled a small part of the chaos, even though this part was only one in a billion of the chaos.</p>

  <p>But in the end, he had it under control.</p>

  <p id="top_2">Once Luo Zheng became more familiar with the chaos, he would be able to unleash the chaotic energy to an unimaginable degree.</p>

  <p>Therefore, in the eyes of Holy Drew, Luo Zheng was an unfathomable sword embryo. What he would build was an unimaginable weapon, a weapon with endless possibilities.</p>

  <p>An entire pot of Sunrest Wood Spring was poured onto Zheng's body, but still the strength of his body did not meet the requirements set by Holy Drew.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unable to use his strength, and his inner world had been sealed as well. He could only watch helplessly as Holy Drew tormented him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also understood that the person in front was tempering him, but he was going through a lot of pain during the process of hammering and tempering.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew continued to ignore Luo Zheng and showed hesitation on his face.</p>

  <p>His eye flashed as he stood in deep thought for a long time. Finally, he laughed. "You're lucky!"</p>

  <p>With that, he flicked his hand and a stone appeared.</p>

  <p>The stone was crystal clear and exuded a faint orange glow. It was quite eye-catching.</p>

  <p>"Wow!"</p>

  <p>Holy Jay, who was observing from outside the cave, had a strange expression on his face when he saw this stone. Soon, his lips curled up into a smile. "Isn't this guy famous for being stingy? How come he is so generous this time?"</p>

  <p>"Holy Jay, what is that stone?" Tianming asked in confusion. Looking at Holy Jay's expression, he realized the stone must be quite extraordinary.</p>

  <p>"That is a Godly Tile," said Holy Jay.</p>

  <p>"A Godly Tile?" Tianming's eyes narrowed as he tried to figure the meaning.</p>

  <p>When one obtained a Godly Tile, they could become a True God. Holy Beings did not allow True Gods to enter the universes that they had created, but that did not mean that the Godly Tiles were rare.</p>

  <p>Godly Tiles could be formed by the warriors themselves, or warriors could take away others' Godly Tiles. The divine land was a world full of True Gods. Just a single Godly Tile was unable to make Holy Jay feel weird.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay could feel Tianming's doubt, so he explained, "Godly Tiles have one characteristic, and that is they are unbreakable. Although the lifespan of a True God is endless, many True Gods have perished since ancient times. However, almost all of the Godly Tiles have been preserved. Even a Holy Being cannot casually destroy a single Godly Tile."</p>

  <p>"Even Holy Beings are unable to destroy Godly Tiles?" Tianming was astonished at this revelation.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay nodded. "After a long period of time, some of the Godly Tiles had already lost their divinity and turned into useless Godly Tiles. These useless Godly Tiles keep piling up like a mountain. However, what is astonishing is that even after an unimaginably long period of time, not a single Godly Tile has been damaged, whether those Godly Tiles came from a low-rank True God, a top-rank True God, or even a Holy Being."</p>

  <p>Tianming nodded. He was not aware about the ability of these Godly Tiles.</p>

  <p>If Godly Tiles were refined into weapons, wouldn't that mean the weapons were unbreakable too?</p>

  <p>Holy Jay nodded in agreement saying, "There are people who use Godly Tiles as weapons. However, they only use Godly Tiles as the toughest stones to smash people. They are completely unable to process or forge!"</p>

  <p>"Then what is Holy Drew up to?" Tianming asked.</p>

  <p>Since the Godly Tile couldn't be damaged, what was going on with this transparent Godly Tile that Holy Drew had taken out?</p>

  <p>"This Godly Tile is very special. Back then, when this object appeared, the Holy Beings were also fighting over it. In the end, it ended up in his hands. Who would've thought that he would be willing to take it out today!" Holy Jay could not help but sigh at this confusing situation.</p>
