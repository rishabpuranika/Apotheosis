  <p>
</p>

  <p>The golden liquid's aura was quite similar to that of the Descending Rings.</p>

  <p>Not long ago, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess from the Source World personally asked Luo Zheng for the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits. When they were used together with the Descending Rings, they could directly summon anything from the Other Shore down to the chaos. It was a way equivalent to breaking the restrictions of truth!</p>

  <p>In fact, the Primeval Lord of Heaven also knew that there would be a blue-golden storm in the Land of Bone Tribulation.</p>

  <p>The blue was the Soul Interdicting Water, but so far, no one knew what the golden liquid was.</p>

  <p>However, it had been a long time since the Primeval Lord of Heaven was in the Land of Bone Tribulation, and he had long forgotten about the aura of this golden liquid.</p>

  <p>That was why he couldn't connect them to the Land of Bone Tribulation at all when he saw Luo Zheng's golden red Chaotic Source Spirits before.</p>

  <p>But now that Luo Zheng had entered the Land of Bone Tribulation, he and Luo Zheng naturally realized immediately what the golden liquid might be. "Primeval Lord of Heaven, why is this golden liquid's aura in this storm the same as the aura of the Descending Rings?" asked Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was lost in thought. There was a somewhat strange connection between the two.</p>

  <p>The Myriad Tribulations Storm was a great test for warriors who entered it for training, and only those strong-willed enough could pass it.</p>

  <p>The mixture of the golden liquid and the Soul Interdicting Water could cause a violent stab of pain to anyone it hit.</p>

  <p>It was so painful that even the Primeval Lord of Heaven still clearly remembered how it felt when he experienced it over a thousand chaotic eras ago. "If the golden liquid is the same type of thing as the Descending Rings, then it is used to summon things from the Other Shore, while the Soul Interdicting Water works to prevent anything from descending..." Luo Zheng analyzed.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Luo Zheng's words, the Primeval Lord of Heaven broke free from his train of thought. He suddenly perked up and said, "I got it. It turns out that the Land of Bone Tribulation is so ingeniously designed.</p>

  <p>The Instant Civilization was smart to make use of the geographical advantages..." "What geographical advantages?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"As you said, the Soul Interdicting Water prevents things from descending while the golden liquid works the same as the Descending Ring, which is used to summon things down. Their functions contrast each other. If they appear at the same time, then the Myriad Tribulations Storm, which could tear almost everything apart, is formed," the Primeval Lord of Heaven theorized.</p>

  <p>Back then, he couldn't figure out why the mixture of the Soul Interdicting Water and the golden liquid could have such an effect.</p>

  <p>Now, he seemed to have completely understood it.</p>

  <p>The two types of liquid within the storm were like two hands: one hand extended to the Other Shore, while the other extended outside the Other Shore. Naturally, a powerful tearing force was produced.</p>

  <p>"I'll go in first!" the centipede declared before he and his bone plate entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm in the center.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the tribulation skeleton on his opposite side followed suit.</p>

  <p>It entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm from the other side of the storm!</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>Countless drops of blue and gold mixed together and floated inside the Myriad Tribulations Storm. When the droplets hit a body, they exploded and produced numerous strange black cracks. The cracks expanded, then released a powerful tearing force.</p>

  <p>If the droplets hit a body that wasn't cultivated to perfection, then it would be quickly torn apart!</p>

  <p>As the centipede continued to advance, the tribulation skeleton on his opposite side also moved towards the center of the Myriad Tribulations Storm.</p>

  <p>The small water drops in the outermost layer of the Myriad Tribulations Storm were very small and sparsely scattered. About ten feet deeper inside, however, the small water drops grew bigger and became denser. When viewed from the outside, there was a layer of water drops every ten feet? and there was a total of twenty layers from the outermost part to the center of the storm!</p>

  <p>After the centipede was thirty feet deep into the Myriad Tribulations Storm, small rings suddenly appeared on the surface of his body. The rings were tightly locked together and increased the centipede's physical strength.</p>

  <p>"Da! Da! Da!"</p>

  <p>In turn, the rings blocked all the black cracks the small water drops made on his body.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, his tribulation skeleton on the other side experienced the same as well. As a result, the tribulation skeleton glowed a golden light after the storm repeatedly hit his body.</p>

  <p>The water drops at the outermost layer did not affect the tribulation skeleton at all, so the centipede had no choice but to go deeper into the storm every time the Land of Bone Tribulation opened.</p>

  <p>As he moved forward with ease, he abruptly stopped in the sixteenth layer and remained motionless right after. His tribulation skeleton also stopped in the sixteenth layer on the other side.</p>

  <p>Of course, all the Other Shore creatures who saw the centipede move so quickly sported envious looks.</p>

  <p>"It seemed that he can easily withstand sixteen layers of the Myriad Tribulations Storm with the help of the tribulation skeleton?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know when I can reach the same level!"</p>

  <p>"My tribulation skeleton has just entered the third layer..."</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures began to discuss among themselves as they drove their bone plates forward and entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, one's tribulation skeleton became stronger after they entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm. It also affected their real bodies' strength, so it meant that they could advance further after that process.</p>

  <p>But after one got out of the Myriad Tribulations Storm their tribulation skeletons and their real bodies were no longer connected. Only after they had truly obtained the Myriad Tribulations Bodies would their tribulation skeletons and their real bodies finally merge.</p>

  <p>Once all the Other Shore creatures had entered, Luo Zheng also took control of his bone plate and entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm.</p>

  <p>"Da!"</p>

  <p>A blue-golden drop of water hit his right arm first and burst into a black crack. His body slightly trembled.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the tearing force from that small water drop was powerful!</p>

  <p>Fortunately, he had absorbed a large amount of Body-strengthening Jades and his physical body had reached its limit, so he was strong enough to take it. Furthermore, he wasn't afraid of anything because he had the Chaotic Source Spirits to protect his body. Thus, he simply continued to drive the bone plate forward.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Other Shore creatures in the Myriad Tribulations Storm all looked at him.</p>

  <p>As for them, they all activated their body protecting theurgies to defend against the water droplets. Some of them used illusory shield shadows that surrounded their bodies, while some others' bodies glowed with a golden light. While all of them changed in some way, there were no changes in Luo Zheng's body at all.</p>

  <p>"Did that guy just withstand the water drops with his physical body?"</p>

  <p>"Will he really go to the second layer the first time he has entered the storm? He's so aggressive!"</p>

  <p>"Just wait and see, he'll surely suffer!"</p>

  <p>It was known that the water drops were immensely powerful despite their size. It was likely for one to lose their life if they weren't careful in the Myriad Tribulations Storm.</p>

  <p>Some of the Other Shore creatures even began to think that if Luo Zheng was seriously injured, they wouldn't mind killing him. They became more excited now that the Soul Interdicting Water had tainted Luo Zheng, since he would have no way to escape!</p>

  <p>But just as the crowd thought, Luo Zheng had already driven the bone plate thirty feet forward and stepped into the third layer.</p>

  <p>On the other side, his tribulation skeleton also sat upright on the bone plate.</p>

  <p>The water droplets continuously hit it, but there were only faint golden marks on its surface.</p>

  <p>"Even though these small water drops have a strong tearing force, it cannot affect my body on a large scale. Warriors at the Chaotic Source Realm are best at resisting such attacks," Luo Zheng said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits feared bearing too much power at once the most. However, the constant tearing of the water droplets hardly exhausted them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked ahead and the corner of his mouth slightly curled up. Then, he did something that surprised everyone around him.</p>

  <p>He leaned forward a little, then the bone plate quickly moved forward. In the blink of an eye, he was already a hundred feet into the storm and had landed at the side of the warrior from the Sturdy Bull race!</p>
