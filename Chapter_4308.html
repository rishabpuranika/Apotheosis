<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4308 Brains </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>From the continental plates, which were tens of millions of miles wide, to the fist-sized stones, they all turned into fine powder and floated upward into the sky.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"What's going on?"</p>

  <p>"Our bodies! They are collapsing!"</p>

  <p>Still, a large number of the creatures remained on the belt of the Source World.</p>

  <p>They all hoped to survive, but luck was not on their side this time.</p>

  <p>Each of them looked around in a panic as they saw inches of their bodies flaking off bit by bit, turning into dust and eventually, drifting into the air.</p>

  <p>A few wanted to escape while others wanted to resist, but their efforts proved to be useless at this point.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was always firm with any decision he had ever made.</p>

  <p>Before, he thought he stood a chance with the help of the Fields, but he soon realized that there was a gap too big to be filled. In this realization, he chose his last resort.</p>

  <p>Within an hour, all the things in the Source World, along with tens of thousands of creatures, were sacrificed. At the same time, the belt completely disappeared and left only the prison on the platform while the black ship floated not too far away.</p>

  <p>Shera, the former captain, and Edna stood on the deck as they witnessed the broken Source World disappear right before their eyes.</p>

  <p>"Thanks to the Evil God, my black ship will survive," the former captain said with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>"This is crazy... I like it. Too crazy," Shera exclaimed giddily.</p>

  <p>Edna looked over at Shera, her expression as calm as ever. No matter what the Evil God did, she would wholeheartedly support him.</p>

  <p>"Grow!" the Evil God roared.</p>

  <p>Just then, the prison on the platform expanded rapidly and new avatars shot up one after the other.</p>

  <p>The number of appearing avatars exceeded one hundred thousand, then five hundred thousand, and eventually, there were one million of them packing densely the platform.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven looked at them and asked, "How many avatars can be made once all the materials in the Source World are consumed?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked down then proceeded to answer, "Around four million."</p>

  <p>Each avatar was far stronger than an ordinary warrior at the Eternal Realm, so the Source World was limited to produce only four million of them.</p>

  <p>"With so many avatars on our side, it's a force that can be reckoned with," the Grandmaster of Heaven pointed out.</p>

  <p>The real Evil God sneered, "Four million ants are still no match for an elephant. They are not strong in battle, but I only need their intelligence."</p>

  <p>One of the avatars who stood behind the prison fence overheard their discussion. "If you only need our intelligence, then our bodies are useless.</p>

  <p>I suggest you create only our heads."</p>

  <p>The avatar's words struck a chord with the Evil God. A big smile plastered across his face. "That is reasonable. I will only keep your heads!"</p>

  <p>This was an advantage because if he only created their heads, he would no longer need the prison anymore.</p>

  <p>At first, the Grandmaster of Heaven thought the Evil God had joked about creating only heads. To his surprise, the Evil God immediately started to sacrifice for the second time.</p>

  <p>Most of the avatars agreed to the plan and readied themselves as they were eager to find the source of energy. Others, however, resisted and cursed at the Evil God. Sadly for them, they had no choice. All the bodies of the avatars quickly disintegrated into pure energy.</p>

  <p>A few minutes passed and only rows of heads were left across the huge platform. At the same time, more heads were generated and appeared alongside them.</p>

  <p>Both the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran scratched their heads in confusion.</p>

  <p>Though neither of them followed any of the rules, they were still shocked with what the Evil God had executed.</p>

  <p id="top_30">What exactly was he trying to do?</p>

  <p>As they watched, they saw the Evil God provide the energy for these heads. This was to ensure that they could think flexibly and extensively.</p>

  <p>"The number of my avatars has soared. It is now one billion and six hundred million." The real Evil God nodded in acknowledgment of what he'd done. He was above and beyond proud of all the progress.</p>

  <p>In fact, he still wanted to create more heads, but he needed to reserve some energy for them to think. So one billion and six hundred million was the limit.</p>

  <p>The avatar that initially suggested creating heads spoke out once more,</p>

  <p>"Actually, our number can still increase. You'd only need our brains to contain our intelligence, and it's far more efficient to communicate with each other with spiritual senses."</p>

  <p>As they heard this, the Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran gasped in shock.</p>

  <p>Was he serious?</p>

  <p>If rows of heads weren't wild enough, what more rows of brains?</p>

  <p>"That's right!" the Evil God exclaimed in delight. "Your eyes, ears, mouths, noses, skulls and teeth can also be sacrificed!" After finishing his words, the real Evil God clapped his hands and executed yet another round of sacrifices.</p>

  <p>Just like that, one billion and six hundred million heads were sacrificed once again.</p>

  <p>When only brains were left with souls within them, the number went up to a whopping two billion.</p>

  <p>These brains held souls that were stronger than any of the warriors at the Holy Soul Realm as they released spiritual senses to search around. It came to a point that so many spiritual senses were intertwined together in the air and formed a chaotic soul windstorm.</p>

  <p>"Quiet down!"</p>

  <p>Once the real Evil God released a terrifying soul pressure, the two billion brains instantly withdrew their spiritual senses and the windstorm settled down into nothing.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, the real Evil God began to delegate the tasks amongst the two billion brains before him. Some were responsible for thinking, some collected information, and some selected useful, decisive information.</p>

  <p>Because the brains contained much chaotic information, they had to work intrinsically together to pull everything off.</p>

  <p>As he finished his arrangements, the Evil God turned around and gazed into the distance. All of a sudden, a silver light flashed.</p>

  <p>His eyebrows suddenly raised. Stretching out his hand, he retracted the black ship and the platform dozens of miles away. Without warning, the fluctuating silver energy flow shot over them all.</p>

  <p>The energy flow swept past them at unbelievable speed, then suddenly disappeared back into the void.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was not the only one who caught a glimpse of it. The Grandmaster of Heaven and Duran couldn't help but pace around as they saw the energy flow.</p>

  <p>"This... This is the energy flow you mentioned?"</p>

  <p>"How can it hold such immense power?"</p>

  <p>The real Evil God looked over at them with a cold, motionless expression.</p>

  <p>"This is the reason why I had to sacrifice the Source World."</p>

  <p>As they knew, the battle between Luo Zheng and the downgrader in the Burial Land was still ongoing.</p>

  <p>Within such a short amount of time, Luo Zheng had already launched six sets of 'Mirror', 'Uniting' and 'Annihilating' in a row, which created gaping holes within the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>But even though his attacks were powerful, it was still unable to kill the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Just then, the downgrader released a light that resembled a dazzling golden sun. The sun surrounded him and expanded along the edge of the Burial Land. At the same time, the Li Shan mountain, the divine land, and the Ruin Graveyard were swallowed up by the golden sun while tens of billions of Troubled Creatures were killed in the process.</p>

  <p>The entire Burial Land grew still and silent, all except for the Immortal Mansion that Luo Zheng managed to protect.</p>

  <p>Once the light of the golden sun eventually dimmed down, the silhouette of the downgrader appeared from a distance. "In the past, when a world ended, Clarence and I had a fierce battle. That was definitely my favorite.</p>

  <p>This time, with you as my opponent, I have to say I am pretty damn bored."</p>

  <p>For him, Luo Zheng merely used tactics that attacked him instead of killing him.</p>

  <p>In the end, nothing Luo Zheng ever struck him with produced substantial damage to him.</p>

  <p>"Ten billion..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood up tall as he raised his hand into the air. Just then, ten billion silver rings of light scattered across the sky.</p>

  <p>It seemed that he was still using the set of 'Mirror', 'Uniting' and 'Annihilating'.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The energy flow gathered and rushed straight at the downgrader.</p>

  <p>Usually, all the downgrader had to do was dodge. However, he'd planned to forcefully block the energy flow altogether.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, as he resisted the energy flow, Luo Zheng's figure quietly disappeared. The next thing he knew, Luo Zheng stood right by the black light.</p>
