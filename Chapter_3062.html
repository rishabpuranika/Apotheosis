<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3062 The Power Of Three Annihilation Strike </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Silence reigned the walls of the cave the moment Zheng began to focus on embracing the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>Zheng noticed something and turned his gaze up at the swords and blinked his eyes several times.</p>

  <p>The many swords on the roof looked like stalactites hanging from the cave.</p>

  <p>All of them pointed at him. The intertwined sword intents gave off an unusual calming vibe as Zheng felt his mind relax underneath them.</p>

  <p>'It turns out that these swords are not only a test, but they can also have a soothing effect by intertwining the sword intents!' Zheng thought to himself as he studied them from below.</p>

  <p>He could not figure out how this was happening, but he could surely feel himself relax under the influence.</p>

  <p>Feeling refreshed from the intertwined sword intents, Zheng began focusing on cultivating the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>The Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship comprised of three moves, each more complex than the last. The first one, being the simplest of them all, was called the Three Annihilation Strike. The "three" mentioned in the technique did not mean blending three Godly Ways; it was far complicated than that. It meant combining three layers of the Ways-blending Energy when the move was being used.</p>

  <p>As he continued to focus and study the Three Annihilation Strike, his eyes flashed a bright color in response to his thoughts.</p>

  <p>The worth of the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship far surpassed any other supreme swordsmanship manuals.</p>

  <p>However, the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship had high barriers to entry— one had to at least be able to blend five hundred Godly Ways. It took a lot of time to cultivate so many Godly Ways in the first place. The tough obstacles to master so many Godly Ways discouraged many warriors from cultivating it.</p>

  <p>But Zheng was an exception. He had already mastered more than enough Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>As a result, he didn't encounter difficulties in practicing the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>One day passed.</p>

  <p>Three days passed.</p>

  <p>Ten days passed.</p>

  <p>Zheng slowly stood up from the jade cushion. He reached his hand out and flicked his fingers. With his signal, a sword fell into his right hand and he clenched it tightly.</p>

  <p>As the Ways-blending Energy began to flow out profusely, Zheng marched forward with determined eyes and left the jade cushion.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The moment he took a few steps ahead of the jade cushion, one of the swords on the roof fell off and came crashing down towards him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng's reflexes were activated as his gaze became sharp.</p>

  <p>He slowly lifted the sword in his hand. Soon as he did this, it reacted to his inner thoughts as a sword radiance emitted from its edges.</p>

  <p>Before, Zheng relied on his unstable Ways-blending Energy to activate the Ways-blending Strike, which was a formidable technique. However, the Three Annihilation Strike was different.</p>

  <p>The sword radiance emitting from the sword with the Three Annihilation Strike consisted of three rays of Ways-blending Energy. Only one of them was the main part and the other two were secondary parts.</p>

  <p>As Zheng released the sword strike, the three rays of Ways-blending Energy fused. The aura unleashed resembled that of the Ways-blending Strike.</p>

  <p>However, when the sword radiance clashed with the sword that fell from the cave towards Zheng, the two secondary rays of Ways-blending Energy exploded. The sword radiance flashed bright and silver.</p>

  <p>The overwhelming energy of the secondary parts converged inwards and activated the main part.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Dazzling white light enveloped the cave.</p>

  <p>The sword that attacked Zheng disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>"The Three Annihilation Strike is so powerful!" Zheng gasped as he stared at the sword in his hands, completely awestruck.</p>

  <p>The same energy was released but the power differed from that of the Ways-blending Strike. Although Zheng had expected the potential of the Three Annihilation Strike to be formidable since the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship was not easy to cultivate, the extent of its power still stunned him. He wondered how many divine megaton of force the Three Annihilation Strike contained.</p>

  <p>More importantly, the Three Annihilation Strike consumed much less Ways-blending Energy compared to the Ways-blending Strike.</p>

  <p>When Zheng lost his focus thinking about his new technique, more swords above his head began to fall towards him. This time, they came after him from all directions.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>More than ten swords shot in a row, each of which contained the force of one divine megaton. This was similar to more than ten warriors at the Other Shore Realm coming to attack Zheng at the same time.</p>

  <p>Of course, this did not mean he was able to fend off more than ten warriors at the Other Shore Realm at once.</p>

  <p>After all, these swords could only manage one blow. But the warriors at the Other Shore Realm would charge continuously. Furthermore, Zheng now could predict their trajectory, speed, and power so the sword attacks were predictable compared to the warriors.</p>

  <p>"Can I deal with these swords with the Three Annihilation Strike?"</p>

  <p>Zheng murmured to himself as he stared at the sword in his hand. He wanted to give it a try without returning to the jade cushion.</p>

  <p>As the Ways-blending Energy in Zheng's inner world continued to gather, he stood prepared with his stance. He began to fight back with the sword in his hand, and streaks of sword radiances flared up in all directions around him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>When each Three Annihilation Strike split, it would produce streaks of light that danced around the corners of the cave. The light was so blinding that Zheng had to use his spiritual sense to navigate around safely.</p>

  <p>He took over ten steps forward and released more than ten sword strikes.</p>

  <p>The blinding white light dissipated. And the swords that flew at him fiercely disappeared from the impact of the attacks.</p>

  <p>Zheng pursed his lips and smiled, feeling proud. When he was about to continue forward, the swords hanging on the cave roof slightly shook. This time, over a hundred swords were raining down on him.</p>

  <p>As he stared at the swords falling on to him, his smug expression stiffened up. He quickly retreated to the jade cushion.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>Over a hundred swords surrounded him, but were blocked by an invisible force.</p>

  <p>His face darkened as he looked around himself surrounded by the swords which almost killed him. 'No wonder the old man said that I might die inside the room. Even those who have reached the Other Shore Realm would find it difficult to deal with these swords, let alone the True Gods, ' he thought to himself as he let out a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Although he knew he would be kicked out of the room after thirty days, he didn't want to leave in such an embarrassing way.</p>

  <p>"Six Annihilation Strike?"</p>

  <p>Zheng murmured as his face brightened. The Six Annihilation Strike was much more powerful than the Three Annihilation Strike, but they were similar in principle.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship, many layers of Ways-blending Energy burst out one by one, leading to the power increase. When one used the Six Annihilation Strike, five layers of Ways-blending Energy would burst out in total.</p>

  <p>As for the Thousand Annihilation Strike, the number of thousand was only virtual. Even if only seven or eight layers of Ways-blending Energy burst out, it was still called the Thousand Annihilation Strike. However, the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship also recorded that there was a possibility of a thousand layers of Ways-blending Energy to burst out using that technique.</p>

  <p>It was hard for Zheng to imagine how powerful it would be. But as the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship was incomplete, even Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself could not reach that level.</p>

  <p>After learning the Three Annihilation Strike, Zheng thought he was strong enough to beat these swords. However, there were so many swords in the cave, and even if he managed to use the Six Annihilation Strike, it would still be difficult for him to leave the cave.</p>

  <p>In the end, Zheng's attention was focused on learning the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Zheng had his reasons to prefer the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship over the Sword Texture Technique. The Sword Texture Technique was so impactful that it was capable of killing the target in one shot. However, the user had to have a high level of cultivation to perfect it.</p>

  <p>Zheng had already mastered the Ways-blending Strike; it was only natural he'd go for something else more challenging and valuable.</p>

  <p>After all, only the best things attracted his attention. Nothing else was worth his time and effort.</p>

  <p>In the next twenty days, Zheng sat atop the jade cushion in the cave and worked on studying the Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship. To him, the challenge of cultivating it far surpassed that of the Godly Ways Blending Swordsmanship. He was determined on emerging victorious from the cave after his thirty days ended. If he got confused over something, he'd morph himself into an avatar and practice in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Time flew, and thirty days had passed in the cave.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, three days had passed outside the Sword Tower.</p>

  <p>The old man glanced at the rooms in the Sword Tower. He paced back and forth with his hands behind his back, thinking Zheng would soon get kicked out of his room. The old man disliked most of the young people because they would not listen to his advice. Thinking about Zheng getting thrown out, he decided to mock him over not listening to him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he heard a muffled voice. One of the rooms of the Sword Tower opened, and a warrior cultivating in the Sword Tower collapsed out of it.</p>
