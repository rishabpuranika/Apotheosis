<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Demon Night was unique from all other races due to the fact that they possessed soul statues which allowed them to easily communicate with the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Thus, the members of the Demon Night in the Lower World were connected and united with their clansmen in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Other races were different. Although some could communicate with the Upper World through secret methods, their links weren't as close. For example, those in the Purple Heart Sacred Place knew next to nothing about their peers in the Upper World and were not aware of the important position the human race actually held up there.</p>

  <p>Among the three queens of the Demon Night, Zheng's sword spirit Xun was the one in charge of killings. This was the primary reason why Yolande hesitated.</p>

  <p>Her fears were not unfounded. The human race and the Demon Night often competed with each other. The secret of the Dark Nether Cave was extremely important, and it was a dispute in the human race.</p>

  <p>Xun let out a bell-like laugh after hearing Yolande's words. "You don't have to worry," she told her. "I've already lost everything. Luo Zheng is my only hope now."</p>

  <p>Xun had followed Luo Zheng with the last shred of her soul and hoped that by sticking to him, she'd one day be able to make a comeback. However, for the time being, she would serve as Zheng's sword spirit.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stared hard at Yolande. "Tell me."</p>

  <p>Yolande shook her head. "My thoughts are somewhat naive. After all, the Heavenly Fragment will, at last, belong to Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Xun whipped her head at Yolande in surprise. "What? Did you just say 'Heavenly Fragment'?"</p>

  <p>The Demon Night queen had thought that nothing else in the world could surprise her but, lo and behold, Yolande came and dropped this kind of bomb on her.</p>

  <p>The others, however, did not have such a strong reaction. Fabian, Jarrod, Malcom, Rehaan, Esther and the two top-level war lords of the Demon Night were surprised at the queen's reaction to Yolande's words.</p>

  <p>Among them, Esther was the most surprised. She was well aware of Xun's status and knew that she was a person who remained calm even in the face of the enormous Mad Scorpion.</p>

  <p>A Demon Night queen was no stranger to supreme legendary beasts, and while the Mad Scorpion was fearsome, it was only an extremely powerful vicious beast as a watchdog of the hell.</p>

  <p>Yolande raised a long, shapely eyebrow and looked at Xun with threatening eyes. "The Heavenly Fragment belongs to the human race. It has nothing to do with the Demon Night."</p>

  <p>Xun's expression calmed. "You're afraid I'll get my hands on it?" She smiled at Yolande coldly. She then fixed her gaze on Luo Zheng. "This is fate," she said. "Luo Zheng will lead the world of chaos and has come all the way to the Sea God Continent. I just didn't expect him to inherit a Heavenly Fragment.</p>

  <p>That's all."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. "Since the Heavenly Fragment is so important, why don't you take it for yourself?" he asked Yolande.</p>

  <p>Frankly speaking, Yolande did not really need Luo Zheng to enter the Dark Nether Cave. She could've gone inside by herself and obtained whatever was hidden inside.</p>

  <p>The Cursed Land was built on the surface of the Sea God Continent, while the Tower of Sin was used to suppress the Dark Nether Cave. The Heavenly Fragment was buried deep inside the cave. Furthermore, it was guarded by a beast from hell with the fragment itself hidden inside its body.</p>

  <p>Xun smiled in realization. "Because she can't take it."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned. "Why?"</p>

  <p>Yolande visibly hesitated before replying, "I don't have the Jade Butterfly, so I can't lure the Heavenly Immortal Root here to open the Mad Scorpion's mouth," she admitted. "Besides, I don't have a complete soul, so I can't really bear the fragment."</p>

  <p>Xun had left a piece of her soul on the Killing Sword Mountain, while Yolande's was split into a million pieces and scattered all over the Lower World for cultivation. Bearing the Heavenly Fragment required a complete soul that neither of them could provide.</p>

  <p>"Then… Where's the fragment?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I learned the language of the green-skinned creatures through scouring Huey's mind. There was an extremely important piece of information I found," Yolande replied. "Those people had sealed the Heavenly Fragment away and given it to the green-skinned creatures' prophet for safekeeping, turning it into their sacred treasure. I told them that I knew their prophet, so they brought us here."</p>

  <p>"In other words, we are going to take away their sacred treasure?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Yolande nodded. "Yep, that's exactly what we're gonna do."</p>

  <p>"Then how do we leave this place?"</p>

  <p>Esther chipped in.</p>

  <p>Her question was rather important. At that point, Esther, Fabian, and the rest of the party did not really care about what this Heavenly Fragment was.</p>

  <p>The conflict in the Upper World had nothing to do with them, as far as they were concerned.</p>

  <p>"If you find the sacred treasure, then you can leave," Yolande replied.</p>

  <p>Her answer made everyone's shoulders slump. This small world had different rules. They couldn't activate their life vitality or forceful energy but could only build up strength and store energy. Each one of them found a corner in the prison to close their eyes and rest. If they wanted to take the green-skinned creatures' most sacred treasure, then they had better be prepared to fight for it.</p>

  <p>Here, even the time flow rate was completely different. There was no sun or moon in the sky, nor were there any stars, so nobody would be able to tell what time it was.</p>

  <p>They spent a few hours in boredom and idle silence. Not long after, a group of green-skinned creatures appeared outside their prison.</p>

  <p>The one at the lead had a withered ring on his head with three fist-sized skulls embedded on the edge. He also held a crooked walking stick and was surrounded by many other green-skinned creatures.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng took one look at the man and whispered to Yolande, "Is that their prophet?"</p>

  <p>Yolande shook her head. "I don't know," she said before standing up and walking towards the green-skinned group.</p>

  <p>The man and Yolande began talking intensively.</p>

  <p>After conversing for a while, the man ferociously poked the ground and turned around to leave. The other green-skinned creatures pointed their spears at Yolande, Luo Zheng, and the rest of the party for a few seconds before leaving with their leader.</p>

  <p>Their actions made Luo Zheng confused. "What was that for?"</p>

  <p>Yolande shrugged. "The communication has failed. They plan to kill us tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Everyone was alerted with this revelation. Since the communications were in vain, they could only make their move to grab the treasure as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to estimate the cultivation of these green-skinned creatures. The rules they had grasped were in accordance to those of this small world. However, because it was built by the spiritual energy between heaven and earth that the Mad Scorpion absorbed, the small world was also a great constraint to them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng approached the edge of the bars and pointed at the green-skinned guard who had taken his space ring.</p>

  <p>The guard had been playing with the ring, trying to figure out how it worked. Seeing Luo Zheng pointing at him and asking him to go over to him, the green-skinned guard muttered a few words and walked towards the cell.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was at an arm's length, Luo Zheng extended his hand at lightning speed and grabbed his ring. He did not give the green-skinned guard any time to react and kicked the bars that were holding them captive. Even without the aid of forceful energy, Zheng's strength was outstanding as the bars crumbled and fell with one kick.</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>There was a loud bang when the five feet wide bars hit the floor and instantly crushed the green-skinned guard underneath. Luo Zheng walked over and stepped on his head, crushing his skull like a soft watermelon on a hot summer day.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng lightly tapped his space ring and brought out a long spear. Without turning, he threw the spear towards Xun who was quick enough to catch it. At the same time, Luo Zheng took out his own broken flying knife. He buckled the ring at the end of the knife on his own thumb.</p>

  <p>With a slight wave of his hand, the knife shot forward into the air with a whoosh.</p>

  <p>Since he wouldn't be able to use his life vitality in this small world, this small flying knife had become an extremely useful weapon.</p>
