<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2105 Ripping Consciousness </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Emperor Soul Imprint was initially a method used by Holy Jay to cultivate his soul. Such a method of cultivation was extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>When the soul's power was released, the Emperor Soul Imprint could release a pressure that could dominate other people.</p>

  <p>The powerful pressure released by the Emperor Soul Imprint was even stronger than the Great Dominance Technique. Even if the opponent was stronger than the user, the user could simply disrupt the opponent's mind.</p>

  <p>If the opponent's strength was on par with the user's, then the user could suppress their opponent. Ultimately, if the user was stronger than their opponent, then they could directly make the opponent yield without any combat. The warrior who practiced the Emperor Soul Imprint could achieve victory without the need for a physical battle.</p>

  <p>However, that particular kind of Mu Ning didn't match with Zheng's personality.</p>

  <p>After all, he wasn't a particularly insolent person. He never wanted to look down on people, especially innocent ones.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, for achieving the Gold Fighting Soul in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Luo Zheng had no other choice. He had already entered the Mind Refining Tower. After all, the soul cultivation method given by Holy Jay was the only method for him to improve his soul.</p>

  <p>Zheng's consciousness continuously observed the soul in his mind. The small swords and the Emperor Soul Imprints interacted with each other.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, they released a golden light. The strange events made Luo Zheng curious about the changes that had occurred in his soul.</p>

  <p>Wasn't that the Emotion Closing Pill he used was to help him comprehend the Emotion Closing Godly Way? How could it cause such a change to his soul? He wasn't aware of such side effects.</p>

  <p>Curiosity enveloped Luo Zheng and made him want to do something.</p>

  <p>As excitement got the better of him, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his head. His vision went black, and he almost fainted again.</p>

  <p>At that moment, his soul was abnormally weak. Even though Wynn had personally nurtured Zheng's soul, it would still not be possible for him to recover so quickly.</p>

  <p>Wynn only had his soul left. However, his True God Soul was far more powerful than the souls of the Supreme Lords. Additionally, his methods were also many times more profound. He knew Zheng's importance to Mike, so he naturally used his last bit of power to help him.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's soul injuries were severe, with Wynn's help, it only took him almost a month to recover from his injuries.</p>

  <p>The second day after his soul had fully recovered, Luo Zheng found a secluded valley. With a relaxed expression, he sat on a boulder within the valley and tightly closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could not measure the power of the seven times refined pill.</p>

  <p>However, the Emotion Closing Pill had tortured him to death. Therefore, the little golden swords that it had left behind on his soul could not possibly be mere decorations.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>Calmness enveloped Luo Zheng as he closed his eyes and entered a meditative state. Suddenly, the power in his soul also began to emerge.</p>

  <p>The sound of peaceful birds also began to echo in the valley.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the tranquil blow of the wind through the grass around was also reflected in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>"Emperor Soul Imprint!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not know how to activate the small golden swords in his soul.</p>

  <p>All he could do was to release the immeasurable power of the Emperor Soul Imprints.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng activated the Emperor Soul Imprints, a strong soul force reverberated through the entire valley.</p>

  <p>The valley that Luo Zheng found was located in a relatively remote area of the Breaking Cloud World. To avoid any disturbances, Luo Zheng had to stay away from those cities. He needed to settle far from any other warriors or humans. Seclusion was considered the primary defense of his valley.</p>

  <p>However, as the most prosperous supreme world of the Celestial Position race within the Breaking Cloud World, there was almost no wasteland.</p>

  <p>Even within a radius of a thousand miles, there were still many small towns and villages. Civilization was still not that far from Zheng's value.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning of Zheng's soul suddenly spread out and scattered in all directions like a flood. The valley had blocked the Mu Ning of Zheng's soul to a certain extent. However, a portion of it was still able to escape and spread out.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the dominant Mu Ning had affected the nearby creatures. The snakes and insects around the valley were greatly frightened as they ran in all directions. The mortals within a thousand miles all felt dizzy and felt inferior. Those without strong willpower couldn't help but kneel down.</p>

  <p>And this was a small portion of Zheng's soul power, the pressure he released was only forty percent.</p>

  <p>Just as he activated the Emperor Soul Imprints, a strange scene appeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but grow even more curious.</p>

  <p>The little golden swords on the surface of his soul began to rotate slowly.</p>

  <p>As they continued to spin, the little golden swords even began to move on the surface of his soul. Their movements were similar to the fishes that swam at a river. The little golden swords were extremely flexible and felt very much alive.</p>

  <p>"Are these little golden swords also alive?" Luo Zheng was dumbstruck since he thought that such a thing was impossible. After all, those small golden swords were the same as the Emperor Soul Imprints. All of them were just imprints left on his soul.</p>

  <p>However, after the little golden swords moved for a while, they all pierced towards the Emperor Soul Imprints. The little golden swords actually merged into the Emperor Soul Imprints.</p>

  <p>At that moment, it seemed that the swords were indeed alive. However, the next events quickly convinced Luo Zheng to deny the idea.</p>

  <p>The Emperor Soul Imprints shrank rapidly, while the small golden swords continuously grew larger and larger. The small golden swords didn't merge into the Emperor Soul Imprints, but instead, absorbed the Emperor Soul Imprints.</p>

  <p>The speed at which they swallowed the Emperor Soul Imprints was extremely fast. As time flew by, the Emperor Soul Imprints continuously shrunk. Not long later, the fist-sized Emperor Soul Imprints had turned into the size of a walnut and then into the size of a cherry. Soon, they were only the size of a sesame seed and then was completely swallowed up by the golden swords.</p>

  <p>As for the small golden swords, they grew in size by ten times. After they devoured the Emperor Soul Imprints, the small golden swords stopped mid-air and floated silently on the surface of Zheng's soul.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?" Doubt was written all over Zheng's face. His expression grew even more cautious.</p>

  <p>He was not sure if the recent changes were good or bad. The Emperor Soul Imprints that he exhaustively cultivated in the Mind Refining Tower had truly disappeared. All his hard work for the Emperor Soul Imprints was suddenly devoured by the small golden swords.</p>

  <p>With his mind continuing to wander, Luo Zheng once again circulated his soul force.</p>

  <p>Without the Emperor Soul Imprints, the small golden swords began to move again. The small swords began to flow rapidly on the surface of his soul. The small golden swords were as fast as hungry sharks. As the golden light flowed, Zheng's eyes also flashed.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a strange sensation overcame him.</p>

  <p>He felt like his soul continuously escaped him. Additionally, his senses began to disappear. Zheng's eyes were also icy cold, and no longer contained even the slightest trace of emotion.</p>

  <p>'I understand now�</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Godly Way is actually closely linked to the soul. It unpredictably affects my soul.</p>

  <p>This Emotion Closing Pill is indeed the most critical link in the Emotion Closing Godly Way...'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng silently thought in his heart. However, he still had a silent and cold expression on his face, without the slightest bit of excitement or joy.</p>

  <p>Indifference was reflected in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had relied on the malicious Mu Ning to suppress his emotions whenever he activated the Emotion Closing Godly Way. However, that was only an unorthodox method; even the malicious Mu Ning could not completely cut off his emotions. It was because the malicious Mu Ning originally contained the emotion of 'wrath.'</p>

  <p>"In the end, the Emotion Closing Godly Way still needs me to cultivate the soul. After all, the soul is the source of the seven emotions and six desires. With this Emotion Closing Pill, can I be considered to have just entered the Godly Way?" Luo Zheng muttered with a cold expression.</p>

  <p>He then reached out a finger to touch his space ring and took out a long sword. With his explosive strength, he slashed the sword in the air and then pointed it at the sky.</p>

  <p>A bit of sword intent condensed on the surface of the long sword. The sword intent gathered made the long sword glimmer faintly.</p>

  <p>The bit of sword intent was only the size of a needle. However, it somewhat constantly shimmered around the tip of the sword.</p>

  <p>"Condensing sword intent?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said coldly as he meticulously observed. At that moment, his emotions were completely gone. As such, he naturally didn't have much of an expression on his face. Under the influence of the Emotion Closing Godly Way, both of Zheng's negative and positive emotions had dissipated.</p>

  <p>Not a single sentiment could be felt by him.</p>

  <p>Wuu! Wuu!</p>

  <p>As the sword intent continued to condense, the silver light it emitted also became stronger. The light grew even brighter as time went by.</p>

  <p>It was as if a star had formed on the tip of the ordinary long sword. A brilliant light glimmered at the pointy end.</p>

  <p>"It's still not enough. To step into the Emotion Closing Godly Way, one has to let go of all their emotions� Those small golden swords did indeed cut off my grief, my happiness, and other emotions. However, I'm not really leaving everything behind," Luo Zheng muttered as he stared at the silver light emitted by the sword intent.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng's heart continuously pounded at a fast pace. He suddenly thought of something and raised his eyebrows. "I finally understand," he said with a cold tone and a blank expression. "Even if I have cut off all my emotions, I still have my own consciousness!</p>

  <p>So the ultimate comprehension into the Emotion Closing Godly Way should be�"</p>

  <p>At that moment, the small golden swords on the surface of Zheng's soul moved even faster.</p>

  <p>As they continued to rotate, golden sword light shot out from Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>It even seemed like Zheng's pupils turned into brilliant stars.</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>

  <p>The sword light that was only emitted from his eyes had directly penetrated the mountains within the valley. All that was left was a thin line of sword marks. The destruction it caused was catastrophic.</p>

  <p>That was the power of Zheng's gaze.</p>

  <p>"It is... Ripping Consciousness!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's strike shot straight towards the sky.</p>

  <p>The strike of his was the same as the strike of Tianming's. Both of their strikes were comparably powerful. However, Tianming's strike was intense and powerful, while Zheng's strike was decisive and sharp.</p>
