<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1508 Emotion Closing Godly Way </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>At this moment, the power contained within the sword intent caused Gus' expression to change drastically. Stunned, he cried out inwardly.</p>

  <p>Almost in an instant, he let go of the sword in his hand and leaned backward, trying to avoid the daunting sword intent.</p>

  <p>But when Luo Zheng truly launched the power of the 'Gods-intimidating Strike', even Luo Zheng himself would not be able to control the strong power it contained.</p>

  <p>The piercing sword intent went straight for Gus and impaled his chest. It pierced through his chest, as if it had not encountered any physical resistance whatsoever. The sword intent escaped out of his back. Golden blood blossomed into golden flowers, morphing into the Dark and Light energies that gradually dissipated.</p>

  <p>"You should have done that a long time ago!" In the distance, Freya stared at this scene in front of her. The corner of her mouth slightly curled up and she let out a long sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the level of Zheng's true strength, in Freya's heart, he was already invincible.</p>

  <p>Aside from the fact that Luo Zheng was unable to fight world lords and Supreme Lords, when had he ever suffered a loss while facing a Soul Sea Realm or Spirit Supreme Realm warrior?</p>

  <p>Freya's insight was naturally inferior to that of Xun. It was even inferior to Livingston's. Livingston was indeed immersed in the path of weapon refining, but he had also been a powerful world lord back then.</p>

  <p>When Livingston and Xun had seen Gus materialize, they realized that he exuded profound strength. Although he had only been at the Soul Sea Realm, they felt that Luo Zheng was in trouble.</p>

  <p>But how could Freya feel that?</p>

  <p>She only saw that the young man was unarmed, yet he had snatched away Zheng's sword two or three times in succession. Luo Zheng, meanwhile, had almost no strength to fight back!</p>

  <p>When she saw Luo Zheng continuously suffer setbacks, she had been incredibly nervous. She also hated Gus. He had known Luo Zheng was his junior fellow disciple, yet he attacked ruthlessly. Clearly, Gus was not a very righteous person.</p>

  <p>However, it was not long before she saw Luo Zheng unleash the astonishing sword attack, injuring Gus. Her heartbeat finally returned to normal.</p>

  <p>The smile on Gus' face had frozen.</p>

  <p>Even though he was only at the Soul Sea Realm, his eyes were sharp.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng unleashed his sword intent, Gus realized that it was passed down in the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>The specialty of the Emotion Closing Godly Way was decisive killing.</p>

  <p>The instant one executed a sword move, one could completely close off all his or her emotions.</p>

  <p>However, one usually had access to the edge of the Emotion Closing Godly Way only after becoming a world lord. Even a Supreme Lord would not be able to display the full extent of the Emotion Closing Godly Way, but the Mu Ning contained within Zheng's sword strike seemed to have reflected that.</p>

  <p>'Is this boy truly only at the Soul Sea Realm?'</p>

  <p>Gus suspected that Luo Zheng was a True God, reincarnated with the latter's memories and insights.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes turned cold once again after the attack. No warmth seemed to exude from his body. At the same time, a wisp of sword intent constantly pulsated on the edge of the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, emitting a faint blue light.</p>

  <p>He did not give Gus the chance to recover. The Gods-intimidating Strike contained a majestic Mu Ning, and it was already shooting at Gus.</p>

  <p>"Stop! Calm down. We can talk about this..."</p>

  <p>Gus vigorously tapped the ground with his hand. His body flashed. The outline of his figure turned erratic right in front of Zheng's eyes. Luo Zheng could not see him clearly anymore.</p>

  <p>Gus displayed his strange escaping technique in an attempt to dodge Zheng's slash.</p>

  <p>A few drops of golden blood fell to the floor.</p>

  <p>In the next moment, Gus appeared beside Luo Zheng with a wry smile on his face. "We can talk about this without fighting..." Even before he finished speaking, Gus's expression changed once again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng let out a short huff. His eyes still flickered with a cold light as the Thunder Wind Divine Sword slashed a circular sword light in the air. It was the Gods-intimidating Strike. It was still incomparably fast and still possessed a terrifying might.</p>

  <p>Gus' movements were still strange as he tried to deploy his technique. He barely managed to dodge the attack.</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Strike could be called one of the most powerful sword skills in the universe. Whether it was speed or power, it reached the pinnacle of swordsmanship in both aspects.</p>

  <p>If Gus himself had personally come and stood there while Luo Zheng slashed tens of thousands of times with his sword, he would not have lost anything. However, the Gus before him was only at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Dodging Zheng's attack was quite an arduous task.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Another golden flower of blood bloomed on Gus's leg. The wound was so deep that the bone was visible.</p>

  <p>"I have something important to tell you. Can you stop? Let's have a good talk first!" Gus' features were anxious, but his words had no effect on Luo Zheng. Right now, Luo Zheng had already entered the state of closing emotions.</p>

  <p>Although he could not block out all the emotions in his heart, he was anyway not the least bit interested in the nonsense Gus was spouting.</p>

  <p>"Damn you! The Primal Chaos Technique is awful!" Seeing that Luo Zheng was still wielding the sword at him, Gus once again used his escape skill to avoid the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>Zheng's Gods-intimidating Strike was indeed powerful, but it was not so impressive in Gus' eyes. What had him troubled was the Primal Chaos Technique.</p>

  <p>The reason for it was simple.</p>

  <p>A sword move like the Gods-intimidating Strike demanded a high amount of life vitality from a martial artist. The speed at which the life vitality was being consumed was much more.</p>

  <p>Warriors at the Soul Sea Realm who cultivated the life vitality system could only use two strikes at most. Then they had to stop and replenish their life vitalities.</p>

  <p>However, this boy in front of him did not have the life vitality within his body. Rather, he was accumulating chaotic energy in his body!</p>

  <p>In his early years, Gus had heard from his master that the natures of the chaotic energy and the life vitality were similar.</p>

  <p>For instance, life vitality could be turned into something through visualization, but chaotic energy could directly be turned into something.</p>

  <p>Life vitality could form a world within the body and nurture life, while the chaotic energy was the very foundation of all life.</p>

  <p>It was also because of this conjecture that his master had written the 'Primal Chaos Technique' and was quite proud of it. Chaotic energy was thousands of times thicker and more solid than life vitality, and once successfully cultivated, the sea of the chaotic energy that the body contained was multiple times more powerful than the sea of life vitality that it could cultivate.</p>

  <p>Later on, when his master had finished compiling the 'Primal Chaos Technique', he mournfully commented that no one in the entire universe would be able to cultivate the Primal Chaos Technique. He told Gus that if he met such a person in the future, he would undoubtedly take him in as his third disciple.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was able to unleash the 'Gods-intimidating Strike' again and again without hesitation, while Gus did not even have time to speak. He only tried to flee in every direction.</p>

  <p>Slashes of sword intent continued to pierce through the True Path, as if they were invisible blades slicing a number of cracks in the ground. Luo Zheng walked slowly, closing in on Gus step by step.</p>

  <p>With every thrust of his sword, the ground was covered with more golden blood. The wounds on Gus' body also increased in number.</p>

  <p>Saul, who was watching the battle, also looked surprised. As a 'high level' puppet, his appearance was no different from a human's. Therefore, he could show more expressions than ordinary puppets. "I never thought that Gus would find it hard to tackle Luo Zheng!" he said.</p>

  <p>Freya looked at Saul curiously, thought for a while, and said, "Wasn't it obvious? Luo Zheng has a weapon, but Gus... he is unarmed, and he is also just at the Soul Sea Realm." She had originally wanted to point out that Gus was already coping well, being at the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>He was still able to fight Luo Zheng to this extent. However, right now she was inside the fairy palace, which she felt was extraordinary in itself and it intimidated her. She was too embarrassed to retort to Saul.</p>

  <p>Saul gave her a small smile and said, "You don't understand. Gus possesses the bloodline of a king of the Sacred race and is considered a top existence in the race. My master took him in as a disciple, so how could he be weak? You treat him as an ordinary warrior at the Soul Sea Realm? Pah!"</p>

  <p>The 'master' that Saul was referring to was naturally Zheng's master as well.</p>

  <p>Even though Xun, Livingston, and Freya were not aware of Gus's origins, Saul knew of it all too well.</p>

  <p>As someone who had surpassed the heavens, Gus was now someone who could secure a place even in the world above the heavens. Even though he was only at the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm now, in fact, he should still be much stronger than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, Saul was only expressing his feelings. If his master were to come to know of Zheng's strength, he would be extremely pleased. As for the fight on the True Path, Saul would naturally not stop it.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Some more golden blood spurted out.</p>

  <p>By now, Luo Zheng had chopped up most of Gus's body into pieces. His body parts turned into Dark and Light energies and gradually diffused in the air.</p>

  <p>Only his head and upper body were left on the ground now. He could not dodge the attacks any more.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's offense slowed down. He walked up to Gus and squatted down, saying, "Speak. Now we can have a good talk."</p>
