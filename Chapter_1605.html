<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1605 Flame Kitten </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Janet had always been something of a leader figure along the way, so everyone would always turn to her whenever they entered a new hall.</p>

  <p>After all, she was the only one who was somewhat familiar with the Halls of Causality--but now, all who were present clearly understood that the man named Tianxing was their true leader.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng stared at the mountain-sized giant for a long while with a frown. The rest of them just gazed at him too, and wondered what his next plan of action was.</p>

  <p>He scratched his head and let out an exasperated sigh. "What is this thing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Janet who stood next to him couldn't help but look at him helplessly. She didn't expect that Luo Zheng did not even know what a Lava Giant was.</p>

  <p>Even Jeffrey, Hailey, and the others all looked at Luo Zheng the same.</p>

  <p>Only Coleman was oblivious to what had transpired. He stared at the Lava Giant and muttered, "This thing seems to be stronger than I am!"</p>

  <p>"This Lava Giant is a Law Creature, created by Original Laws. It contains the Earth Law and the Fire Law. Such a massive Lava Giant would probably need the sixth layer of the Fire Law's power to be born,"</p>

  <p>Janet said lightly.</p>

  <p>It was known that Law Creatures were quite common.</p>

  <p>For instance, a thunder spirit was born from dense thunders, while immortal flames conceived a fiery evil spirit.</p>

  <p>However, those were all low level Law Creatures.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, higher level Law Creatures required a higher level energy of Original Laws to be slowly nurtured.</p>

  <p>For example, the golden wind blades that emerged from the storm Luo Zheng previously encountered in the Chaotic Ocean of Stars. They were all higher level creatures of the Wind Law.</p>

  <p>There was silence in the air at that moment as everyone tried to look for ways to pass through the magma lake.</p>

  <p>Coleman's burly figure passed through and walked two laps around the edge of the magma lake. He suddenly noticed that the surface of the lake started to fluctuate and emit fiery red ripples.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Coleman exclaimed. He stared at the red ripple, and then his face twisted into a strange expression.</p>

  <p>"Plump�"</p>

  <p>Small bubbles of lava appeared within the magma lake, and then spirals of fire danced in the air when they burst open. Once the flames began to dance, they stopped spinning.</p>

  <p>Only then did everyone realize that the flames were actually in the shape of several kittens that were about a foot long.</p>

  <p>The kittens looked like innocent and docile pets as they floated on the surface of the lake, their adorably large eyes wide open while they stared at the warriors in front of them.</p>

  <p>They floated for a while before they dove back into the magma. More magma bubbles exploded afterwards, and more flame kittens crawled their way out of the bubbles.</p>

  <p>"This little thing is quite cute," Coleman said as he stretched out a finger and waved it towards a little flame kitten. Nobody knew what was up with him for him to attempt such a thing.</p>

  <p>"Meow�"</p>

  <p>The little flame kitten purred lowly, and then it slowly floated towards Coleman.</p>

  <p>However, it moved at an extremely slow pace. Its legs clumsily glided in the air, which made it even slower than an ordinary person's walking speed.</p>

  <p>Just as it had reached Coleman halfway, everyone heard a cat's mournful cry.</p>

  <p>"Meow!"</p>

  <p>What used to be a docile looking flame kitten suddenly swelled up ten times its original size. Then it aggressively pounced towards Coleman!</p>

  <p>While the little flame kitten looked docile and domesticated at first, now it was the total opposite. The power of the Fire Law contained within it was so strong that everyone couldn't breathe properly. It felt as if a small, glowing sun had appeared before them.</p>

  <p>Coleman relied entirely on his basic reflexes to turn around and flee. The flame kitten was so powerful that he could hear sizzling sounds behind him as he ran.</p>

  <p>Apparently, it was the heat from the flame kitten that had passed through his armor. The metal plates on his back hadn't melted, but the heat was enough to turn his armor red and boiled!</p>

  <p>"This flame! Everyone disperse!"</p>

  <p>Soon enough, everyone saw how powerful the tiny flame kitten was and quickly retreated.</p>

  <p>"Help!" Coleman desperately cried out. However, he couldn't stave off the flame kitten behind him. If he ever got caught, he would instantly burn into ashes!</p>

  <p>"Help him!" Although Janet and the others had chosen to retreat, that didn't mean that they would abandon Coleman.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh swoosh swoosh!"</p>

  <p>Jeffrey raised his hand up and shot three ice cones. His achievements in the Ice Law weren't a joke, after all. However, the three ice cones melted into water and were instantly vaporized by the scorching heat before they could even reach the kitten!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned when he saw the scene. The moment he had activated his forceful energy, he darted swiftly to the other side like lightning. He tilted his body to the side as he raised his leg, and then directly kicked the back of Coleman's armor!</p>

  <p>The impact of his kick was so strong that Coleman was sent flying outside the Hall of Causality!</p>

  <p>In turn, Coleman's speed had increased more than twofold. When he finally charged out of the Hall of Causality, the little flame kitten slowly floated back and chose not to attack Luo Zheng and the others. Instead, it leaped and sank back into the magma.</p>

  <p>"This little flame kitten� It should be the pure power of fire, born from the seventh layer of the Fire Law," Hailey said and took a step back as she stared at the dancing flame kittens. "In other words, the power of the Fire Law in this magma lake may not be on the sixth layer, but the seventh!" she said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Only Hailey was a master of the Fire Law out of all the martial artists present, so she had an authority to speak about it.</p>

  <p>"The seventh layer of the Fire Law! No wonder the kitten was so powerful when it attacked me," Coleman sighed. It turned out that Janet had underestimated it when she said that the Lava Giant's two Original Laws should be around the sixth layer.</p>

  <p>"Who cares which layer it is! That doesn't matter. What matters most now is how we are about to pass this lake," Coleman said. He stared at the large magma lake and remembered the kitten's power, which made him shudder.</p>

  <p>There were no bridges or ropes above the magma lake, since it was a dead-end place.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, it wasn't just ordinary magma. A Soul Sea Realm warrior was supposedly strong enough to swim directly in ordinary volcanic magma, which could never break the defense of the warriors' life vitality?</p>

  <p>However, it could be said that the power of the Fire Law in the magma lake was something they couldn't even resist.</p>

  <p>That was the rule of this Hall of Causality. In general, every hall had their own different rules, which couldn't be broken no matter how hard they tried to. The only exception was when Luo Zheng had used the small skull to stop the giant square rock to turn over, but that was also because the skulls on Zheng's back contained power that was almost comparable to the laws of the heavens. It was why the small skull was able to resist the huge rock and not get crushed. Moreover, the power in the small skull could even go against the heavens' rules in the rock.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt the intense heat transmit over to him while he stood by the lava lake, which made him retreat a few steps. He sighed wistfully as his eyes constantly scanned the cave's surroundings, trying to search the effective way out of the lava lake.</p>
