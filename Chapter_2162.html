<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng's rhetorical question caught Lambert by surprise.</p>

  <p>Lambert stared coldly at Luo Zheng and asked, "Which clan do you come from?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. "Why should I tell you?"</p>

  <p>Lambert knew this tactic as a swift and decisive person. Luo Zheng answered himself with three "why" words in a row.</p>

  <p>He already realized that threats were useless against Luo Zheng. After all, Luo Zheng was a very fearless person.</p>

  <p>But as a guard of the Hulan Clan, Lambert had to be observant and smart. Since Eric had lost five thousand divine might coins, he would not refuse to give them to Luo Zheng under the watchful eyes of the people. After all, there still happened to be the elders of the other clans on the fifth and sixth floors of the Brilliant Moon Restaurant.</p>

  <p>Without looking back, Lambert walked up towards the other side.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the two servants of the Huoulan Clan had already helped Eric up.</p>

  <p>Lambert reached out his hand and gently pointed at Eric's forehead. Just then, a powerful ray of light coruscated from between Eric's eyebrows.</p>

  <p>His mind was just put at rest.</p>

  <p>Eric suffered a great amount of bone damage after Zheng's hit. However, it was common knowledge that physical injuries were easiest to heal, taking around two to three days to recover. This was supposed to be no hindrance to his test of the Heavenly Han House. What worried Lambert the most was Eric's soul because he did not dare to underestimate Zheng's power.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, only a small hole was found on Eric's soul, so it was not really something to worry about. It seemed that Luo Zheng had been lenient on him, but Lambert still sighed in his heart. It was hard for him to imagine how a proving godly warrior could cultivate his soul to such a state.</p>

  <p>After collecting all the divine might coins on the ground, Luo Zheng cupped his hands in salute towards Lambert and the others. Then, as if there was no one else present, he walked out of Brilliant Moon Restaurant with his head held high.</p>

  <p>Gasps and whispers filled the restaurant once Luo Zheng exited.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell was that man?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he used the food in the restaurant to refine a food pill, so he should be a citizen of Six-Burden Divine City, right?"</p>

  <p>"That's not even the point. I just wonder how he became so strong. He defeated Eric with only one move. It seems that he even played it easy on him. Eric would have been dead if he went all out."</p>

  <p>These people continuously wondered but had no clue that Luo Zheng was more powerful than anything they could ever imagine.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Eric was just an elite disciple from a second-tier clan.</p>

  <p>Even the proving godly warriors who were trained by the influential clans on the Floating Islands were no match for Luo Zheng. Eric didn't stand a chance.</p>

  <p>Due to the special nature of Zheng's inner world, he had not managed to condense the Godly Tile. But once he successfully condensed the Godly Tile, his strength would be enhanced by millions. By then, ordinary low-rank True Gods would find it nearly impossible to defeat him.</p>

  <p>In a strange room found on the fifth floor, an old man stretched out his hands and gracefully waved them in the air.</p>

  <p>A fire began to slowly emit between his hands. This fire wrapped around something that was constantly burning, emitting a faint and peculiar fragrance.</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>As the sound echoed, a light yellow pill fell out from the fire. It slowly rolled about in the golden plate, emitting a buzzing sound.</p>

  <p>Once the pill appeared, a strange odor quickly lingered within the room.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, the old man gently pushed the plate to the other side of the table. "Please enjoy it," he said.</p>

  <p>Across the table was a girl dressed in green. She smiled and responded,</p>

  <p>"It smells so good. Thank you, Grandpa Bruce!"</p>

  <p>Within seconds, the girl put the pill into her mouth and swallowed. An intoxicated expression immediately plastered across her face.</p>

  <p>The food pill that the old man refined was similar to the one Luo Zheng did. It was known as the Original Pure Food Pill.</p>

  <p>Very few people knew how to refine the Original Pure Food Pills, and most of them were the old True Gods. Bruce Hu was one of them, having refined pills for many years now. After the girl swallowed the pill, Bruce said in a hoarse voice, "At such a young age, that man has already known how to refine Original Pure Food Pills. His soul and strength are exceptionally strong. I wonder what kind of Godly Way he is cultivating.</p>

  <p>He managed to defeat Eric with a single move!"</p>

  <p>"It was not even a defeat." The girl shook her head. "It was a one hit kill."</p>

  <p>For sure, Luo Zheng had the ability to kill Eric with one move, but for some reason, he had shown mercy at the last possible second. Anyone who had seen Luo Zheng could easily see that.</p>

  <p>"Right. He could have killed Eric just like that," said Bruce. "We can't underestimate him. Miss, we need to investigate his origin."</p>

  <p>The green-clothed girl smiled. "At this point, investigation is necessary. I understand that his past must be very interesting, too."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Miss," Bruce said as he snapped his fingers to her face,</p>

  <p>"You and that guy are not the same kind of person. Don't be attracted by him." His eyebrows rose in concern.</p>

  <p>She furrowed her eyebrows and chided, "Grandpa Bruce, what are you talking about? I don't like him!"</p>

  <p>"I know you well." Bruce chuckled. "And I know exactly what you're thinking about."</p>

  <p>The girl gave him a glare, not saying another word.</p>

  <p>Aside from this room, other rooms on the upper floors were discussing and debating Zheng's identity and background.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had come from Mirror City and hadn't introduced himself. No matter how much they discussed, he would remain a mystery to all of them. At this point, they could only anticipate his test of the Heavenly Han House, and they believed that they would know that day.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng left the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, he strolled leisurely through the streets of Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>He spent a lot at the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, but did not expect to receive five thousand divine might coins right after.</p>

  <p>The impulsiveness of Eric brought him those coins so effortlessly.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, he knew that this was just a one-shot deal. The next time, he probably wouldn't be so lucky.</p>

  <p>There were only six or seven days left before the test of Heavenly Han House, so Luo Zheng had to gather some information in Six-Burden Divine City.</p>

  <p>He mastered the disguise technique quite well from Master Evil, but it proved to be very strange.</p>

  <p>It was not about making a human skin mask, or changing the face of a stranger as normal people would do.</p>

  <p>The technique of Master Evil was a method of cultivation, as well as a method of body refining. However, it didn't aim to train one's strength or body, but rather, to train the muscles on one's face. As he continued to practice this technique, every muscle on his face would move, thus allowing him to change his appearance completely.</p>

  <p>In this way, others wouldn't feel too shocked when they saw Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, people could recognize him based on the memories of the past few days. They just felt that Luo Zheng was a bit unfamiliar.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face kept changing when he trained his muscles to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>This way, even if he went to the Floating Island of the Han Clan, the two sisters who saw him in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and other members of the Han Clan wouldn't be able to recognize him at all.</p>

  <p>In addition to the disguise technique, Luo Zheng also wanted to expand his inner world and practice his martial arts skills to a greater extent.</p>

  <p>After he became a world lord in the universe, many of the martial arts that he cultivated in the past became useless. However, it was a different case in the divine land. Because they were unable to fly in the air, they had to fight hand-to-hand. In other words, the basic martial skills played an important role.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng had to be very careful when using chaotic energy. He didn't dare to use the Emotion Closing Godly Way as it was classified forbidden in the divine land. If he was caught using it, he would get into a lot of trouble.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't use his trump cards now, but he was still full of confidence nonetheless.</p>

  <p>According to Master Evil's analysis, as one of the three great clans under the rule of the Han Clan, the Hulan Clan was quite powerful. Eric was from this clan, and was renowned one of the best warriors they had to offer.</p>

  <p>But since Eric proved to be powerless against Luo Zheng, the disciples of the other clans would be even less likely to fight back.</p>

  <p>Although there might be a few strong competitors, Heavenly Han House offered at least ten spots. Given his abilities, Luo Zheng would not fall out of the top ten. Therefore, he had a sure spot in the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Before the test, many clans would order their men to gather information about their competitors in Six-Burden Divine City for a competitive advantage. Therefore, everyone was more or less knowledgeable of the potential competitors.</p>

  <p>A group of people spent their lives collecting such information and selling it to the great clans and sects as a business.</p>

  <p>The information included the characteristics, strength and specialties of the competing martial artists. Even their Godly Ways and cultivation methods were also recorded.</p>

  <p>Notably, after his fight with Eric, Luo Zheng was honorably ranked at the fourth place.</p>

  <p>But for some reason, his information was completely different from that of the others.</p>

  <p>His basic information was all unknown and difficult to discover.</p>

  <p>The only thing that had been acknowledged was his strength. His fight with Eric had been briefly described. With a tremendous power, he had defeated Eric in one simple, drastic move.</p>
