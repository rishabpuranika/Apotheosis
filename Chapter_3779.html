<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The majority of people didn't spend a long time on the twentieth layer.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven, for example, had merely spent a short while on that layer once he had successfully concluded his cultivation on the nineteenth layer. Within a short span of time, the refining of his tribulation skeleton had been completed, and he had achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng had spent little time on the first nineteen layers, so it stood to reason that he should require more time on the twentieth layer.</p>

  <p>But the Primeval Lord of Heaven had obviously underestimated the refining speed on the twentieth layer. After just a few minutes, Luo Zheng had successfully completed his refining.</p>

  <p>In other words, if someone could directly bear the power of the blue gold currents on the twentieth layer, then theoretically, they would only require one or two days, or even less, to achieve the Myriad Tribulations Body!</p>

  <p>'I've already achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body?' Luo Zheng studied his tribulation skeleton with a dazed expression.</p>

  <p>As the tribulation skeleton emitted a golden light, the bone plates beneath his feet and his tribulation skeleton began to rotate with the tornado. The distance between the two bone plates decreased continuously, and finally they overlapped with each other!</p>

  <p>'Is this bone plate an illusion?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned when he saw the two bone plates intersect and fuse into each other.</p>

  <p>At this point, not only did the bone plates become phantasmal, but even the tribulation skeleton morphed into a phantom.</p>

  <p>When the two bone plates were completely overlapped, Luo Zheng and his tribulation skeleton followed suit.</p>

  <p>Once the tribulation skeleton had completely entered Luo Zheng's body, the golden light became diffused and faded into nothing. But Luo Zheng felt as if his bones had been scorched by fire, and he felt a fiery agony in his skull, spine, arms, and legs...</p>

  <p>At this time, Luo Zheng was already within the eye of the tornado, sitting atop the bone plate while spinning crazily.</p>

  <p>"In two months, he has already achieved the Myriad Tribulations Body..." the Sturdy Bull murmured in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Even though he was clueless as to the shortest time to achieve the Myriad Tribulations Body, from his point of view, Luo Zheng's cultivation speed was simply miraculous as he had got the Myriad Tribulations Body after the Land of Bone Tribulation opened only twice!</p>

  <p>"Achieving the Myriad Tribulations Body is not his limit," the centipede said. "The twentieth layer was still quite easy for him. He is very likely to move to the next level."</p>

  <p>"The next level?" another creature queried curiously.</p>

  <p>The centipede nodded and said with wizened eyes, "It is said that very few people can obtain the Bone Tribulation Imprints in the Land of Bone Tribulation. Yet, one requires those imprints to become a super strong warrior!"</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures were of naturally inferior numbers compared to the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>The centipede and the Sturdy Bull were both considered talents among their own races. However, as the creatures in the Source World were countless times more numerous than those of the Other Shore, and the chances of a talent being born were much greater, the vast majority of the talents who obtained the Bone Tribulation Imprints came from the chaos.</p>

  <p>Just as the centipede had anticipated, Luo Zheng's entire body began to sink while spinning.</p>

  <p>The blue golden tornado quickly gobbled Luo Zheng down like a fast flowing vortex.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng sank swiftly to the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A light column rose to meet him from the bottom, and Luo Zheng was soon enveloped.</p>

  <p>'This light column is similar in nature to that in the Soul City...' Luo Zheng's eyes flashed with recognition.</p>

  <p>While contemplating this, he suddenly felt a burning sensation on his back.</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>It was as if a red hot iron had been placed on his back, branding a mark on it.</p>

  <p>"Dirty Body Imprint!"</p>

  <p>Before the burning feeling subsided, another scorching imprint was ruthlessly placed on his chest.</p>

  <p>"Internal Shaking Imprint!"</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>"Lasing Golden Imprint..."</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng plummeted downward, the Bone Tribulation Imprints continued to appear on his body one after another.</p>

  <p>After descending all the way to the bottom, nine Bone Tribulation Imprints seared into his flesh one by one, as if they had been prepared in advance.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't feel anything except when these imprints touched his body.</p>

  <p>"This is also similar to what happened in the Soul City. Didn't you say that nine Bone Tribulation Imprints were incredibly difficult to get?" Luo Zheng asked since things were quite different from what he had expected.</p>

  <p>In the Soul City, Luo Zheng had also obtained nine Holy Soul Imprints without much effort. At that time, he and the Primeval Lord of Heaven had been extremely confused, but now, the similar thing had happened again. With so little difficulty, he got nine Bone Tribulation Imprints, which was reeking of strangeness.</p>

  <p>"It's indeed odd," the Primeval Lord of Heaven agreed, and his face shone with confusion.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was blind luck that Luo Zheng had obtained the nine Holy Soul Imprints in the Soul City. But now such a thing had happened again in the Land of Bone Tribulation, and this clearly had nothing to do with luck.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the mystery, it was beneficial for Luo Zheng to obtain the Bone Tribulation Imprints successfully.</p>

  <p>Outside the light column was a dark blue sea.</p>

  <p>The vast sea in the Sanskrit Light Stage was a mysterious landscape to those of the outside world.</p>

  <p>To the Other Shore creatures, the Sanskrit Light Stage was those bone caves. The world outside the bone caves seemed to not exist. Only when the bone caves were broken would the creatures in the sea invade them.</p>

  <p>However, those bone caves were very much alive. Even should they be damaged over a period of time, they could still repair themselves.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the vast majority of the Other Shore creatures only viewed the Sanskrit Light Stage as a passageway.</p>

  <p>Even the Element Spirit race, who knew the Other Shore best, lacked any real knowledge about the Sanskrit Light Stage.</p>

  <p>While Luo Zheng was still at the bottom of the light column, a black figure rose from the depths of the sea like a wraith.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The black figure quickly approached the light column and extended a hand towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>That "hand" was made of a number of tentacles!</p>

  <p>As the tentacles entered the light column, they wrapped around Luo Zheng one after another and pulled him down from the light column!</p>

  <p>When the Other Shore creatures in the Myriad Tribulations Storm witnessed this sudden event, they were all dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>The many strange creatures in the sea had always appeared to be controlled by a law of some kind and never dared to rush into the Land of Bone Tribulation to attack warriors. Therefore, at the occasional sightings of the ghost hand creatures swimming along the sea walls, they were not overly concerned.</p>

  <p>But what happened now boggled their minds!</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng was taken away from the light column?"</p>

  <p>"What kind of creature do those tentacles belong to?"</p>

  <p>"It wants to kill Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Look, there's a spear wrapped in the tentacles over there!"</p>

  <p>Although the light at the bottom of the dark blue sea was very dim, these creatures had excellent vision, and they could still clearly view the events unfolding.</p>

  <p>Some of the tentacles had wrapped around Luo Zheng, while others were wrapped around a long spear!</p>

  <p>The spear was completely blue. Powerful energy was surging within it, and on the surface of the spear tip, a red light was pulsing mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"That spear!" The Primeval Lord of Heaven was shocked at seeing this.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Zheng asked. He also noticed the extraordinary qualities of the spear.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven cautiously explained, "The spear itself is insignificant, but the tip of it is made of a Celestial Stone, which can amplify power nine-fold. It's a very rare and useful treasure in Stage Thirty-three. The only problem is that it can't be combined with the Other Shore Tokens that can amplify force too."</p>
