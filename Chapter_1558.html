<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once she gave him the jade slip then Lucille would have no more means to make Luo Zheng accountable to their deal.</p>

  <p>The use of magnetic power as a secret cultivation technique wasn't even passed down in her own clan. This was privately taught to her by the patriarch himself!</p>

  <p>Lucille usually sat within the Magnetic Sacred Mountain while cultivating with the five elements. She did this in order to extract the surrounding magnetic power in order to aid her cultivation.</p>

  <p>However, the Magnetic Sacred Mountain was incredibly heavy and it was impossible for her to carry it around like Luo Zheng did if she didn't know how to refine it.</p>

  <p>Had Luo Zheng been any other stranger, there was no way she was going to give him such a secret technique.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's knowledge of the refining method was too precious to pass up!</p>

  <p>She couldn't just let him leave, not with the knowledge that he had something of value to her. All Lucille could do was to swallow her pride and exchange information with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on the other hand, was no fool and quickly noticed the trace of hesitation on Lucille's face.</p>

  <p>He knew perfectly what she was thinking but he simply waited for her to make her choice.</p>

  <p>If she didn't believe in him then he could just leave. Now that he knew the potential of the mountain's magnetic power then all he needed to do was to enter the library and search for more information regarding it.</p>

  <p>Finding this method shouldn't be too difficult.</p>

  <p>However, that would mean waiting until after he got out of the Illusion Battlefield. Since Lucille was offering up the information to him now then that would be extremely convenient for him.</p>

  <p>Lucille chewed on her lip but her shoulders visibly slumped in resignation. "You can't spread this technique to others. If you do, my Ji Clan will hunt you down to the darkest corners of the universe!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng would've rolled his eyes but that wasn't exactly polite.</p>

  <p>He was someone who had already killed four Supreme Lords. He was not afraid of the Ji Clan nor the fact that they might also be included in the long list of those who currently waited for him at the gates of his fairy palace.</p>

  <p>Still, he nodded in understanding and took the jade slip that Lucille gave to him.</p>

  <p>With it in his hands, Luo Zheng quickly infused his senses into the jade slip and began to rapidly memorize the technique.</p>

  <p>Just as she said, this technique alone would be enough to help him extract the magnetic power from the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Zheng came upon an epiphany the moment he was done memorizing it.</p>

  <p>A trace of nervousness appeared in Lucille's heart once she saw the change in Zheng's expression.</p>

  <p>She wasn't usually so jumpy but this technique had been passed down to her from the patriarch. The repercussions of him finding out that she gave it to an outsider was numerous and extremely scary.</p>

  <p>There was no exaggeration if she said she would break down if Luo Zheng attempted to run away from her right now.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, this did not happen. Although the information regarding the Blood Refinement Technique was precious, it wasn't of much use to Luo Zheng since he had already refined the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>Also, even if he taught Lucille now, she wouldn't be able to leave the Illusion Battlefield to bring her own Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>"This mountain is impervious to the five elements but there is a method to refine it. This is called the Blood Refinement Technique," he muttered, using chaotic energy to explain it all to Lucille.</p>

  <p>Lucille's eyes were practically shining with excitement as Luo Zheng explained the method recorded in the "Myriad Manifestations of Nature."</p>

  <p>She eagerly listened to his words and absorbed all the relevant information like a sponge.</p>

  <p>"Did you get all that?" he asked after he finished speaking.</p>

  <p>Lucille nodded, "I got it," she assured him. "I wonder who invented this Blood Refinement Technique? It's truly such a brilliant idea!" Lucille thought this person would've most probably mastered the laws of all living things. Only a wise and powerful being could've possibly come up with a method like this.</p>

  <p>In fact, the inventor might even be more knowledgeable than the patriarch in her clan!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, however, couldn't answer this question. "I've already given you the method. You must now fulfill your side of the bargain."</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p>

  <p>Not long after, two warriors stood in front of Luo Zheng outside of the main city.</p>

  <p>Both of them glared viciously at Luo Zheng and didn't even try to hide it.</p>

  <p>They didn't know what kind of deal he and their master had made, but it was clearly to their disadvantage since they now had to give up half of their painstakingly collected Illusion Points to this guy!</p>

  <p>These two warriors far surpassed the strength of ordinary Soul Sea Realm warriors but had since been forced to collect Illusion Points for Lucille ever since entering the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>But now they were tasked to become willing pigs for slaughter to this guy.</p>

  <p>It was truly too much.</p>

  <p>However, their master's words were the law. They merely comforted themselves with the fact that Lucille might've made a very important deal with this young man for them to suffer this consequence.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>It only took Luo Zheng two punches to kill the two warriors and have them explode into two masses of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Each mass was composed of around 200, 000 points which meant he gained more or less 400, 000 Illusion Points in one sitting.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly absorbed these points and his ranking once again rose in the charts.</p>

  <p>He was placed at the 309th place after killing Lucille. After absorbing the massive amount of four hundred thousand Illusion Points from the two warriors, he was now placed 279th in this world and 10096th in the entire Illusion Battlefield! He was only one step away from the top 10, 000.</p>

  <p>The number of warriors inside the Illusion Battlefield was staggering and Luo Zheng wasn't even confident that he would be able to reach first place, however, he was bound to this goal the moment he went in.</p>

  <p>His efforts might prove to be in vain in the end but he must not give up nor relax while he was still in the race. Giving up halfway wasn't his style at all.</p>

  <p>After gathering his points, Luo Zheng didn't waste any more time and quickly left.</p>

  <p>As she watched his retreating figure, the expression on Lucille's face hardened.</p>

  <p>'We should still have a chance to fight in this Illusion Battlefield, ' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>The first stage of the Illusion Battlefield was a competition to get the most number of Illusion Points possible. The Illusion Battlefield was big, being comprised of fifty supreme worlds, but those at the top were most likely to meet again.</p>

  <p>Lucille was very confident about this.</p>

  <p>This Tianxing� He too would most likely be able to see through it to the end.</p>

  <p>During this time, Lucille had to make sure she could combine with Lucy and finally achieve perfection. If things all went according to plan, then she should be able to utilize her most powerful state to defeat all her opponents, especially Tianxing. She couldn't wait!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng was already traversing through the air as he tried to find a place where he'd be safe from prying eyes. Once he was sure that nobody was following him, he took out the Teleportation Token from his pocket and activated it.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>There was this buzzing noise and Luo Zheng once again found himself entering a strange space.</p>

  <p>The number of Illusion Points in the Illusion Battlefield was initially fairly distributed with a hundred points per person.</p>

  <p>However, this was a competition and, as time passed, the Illusion Points slowly began to get concentrated within certain groups of people.</p>

  <p>The Illusion Points possessed by the 'grass' were transferred to the 'sheep' who were then, in turn, eaten by the 'wolves.'</p>

  <p>In the end, the 'wolves' would also perish in the hands of the 'lions' and 'tigers.' Such was the way of the warrior.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng wanted to rank higher, then he would need to continuously collect more Illusion Points!</p>

  <p>Right now, he had around five million Illusion Points and it was probably enough to let him stand among the top ten thousand.</p>

  <p>However, he shouldn't be complacent. Other warriors were constantly collecting Illusion Points and the five million he had now would be nothing after a few hours since there was someone bound to pass by him on the way to the top.</p>

  <p>The only way Luo Zheng could remain where he stood was to persevere and continuously farm for Illusion Points, further increasing the accumulated points he had in his body.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes gazed over the map, and he quickly swooped down to the main city of his choosing. He landed heavily on the ground and immediately saw a sprawling emerald green field in front of him.</p>

  <p>There were towering trees that reached into the clouds with tree houses built onto each one. The city walls were made up of rows upon rows of intertwined old tree roots and there was evidence of dense life force that poured into them.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed in curiosity as he took in the scene. "Is this the main city of the Demon Night race?"</p>

  <p>The sight was interesting but he reminded himself of the reason why he was here in the first place: to gain more Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>However, he never expected to meet up with a familiar face in this area.</p>
