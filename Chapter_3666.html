<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3666 Distress Signal </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, everyone's eyes were on the blazing sky.</p>

  <p>The strong light almost blinded their eyes, especially those of the weak Other Shore Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>However, none of them wanted to lower their heads. After all, whatever happened in the sky was their only hope of living.</p>

  <p>Everyone held their breaths as they carefully watched every movement in the sky, their instinct to survive fueling their attentiveness.</p>

  <p>After a while, the third sun was gone from everyone's sight.</p>

  <p>"Wow..."</p>

  <p>The whole North Mysterious City was in an uproar again.</p>

  <p>"Maybe Emperor Di Jun let us off?"</p>

  <p>"It should be! But why did he do that?"</p>

  <p>"Because we've captured the Jin Wu?"</p>

  <p>The air was filled with chatter as many of them began to guess why.</p>

  <p>They didn't know how Luo Zheng had managed to capture the members of the Jin Wu, but the Jin Wu obeyed him. Thus, it was no surprise that they considered them as "prisoners".</p>

  <p>There were some people who thought that it was Emperor Di Jun who had shown mercy.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, some had different opinions.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that Luo Zheng has done something to destroy the suns?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him leave the North Mysterious City and fly towards the suns..."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible! Luo Zheng is indeed powerful, but he's only an ordinary Chaotic Source Realm warrior. He's only on the same level as the Oneness Generals.</p>

  <p>If even the mountain leaders can't do anything about those suns, then how could he destroy them?"</p>

  <p>Although many people had seen Luo Zheng fly towards the suns, most of them didn't actually think that he could deal with them.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Jago said, "I believe it is Flag Master who has destroyed the suns."</p>

  <p>"I believe the same too!" Kenelm agreed. Meanwhile, Monica looked up at the blazing white sky, her eyes filled with mixed emotions.</p>

  <p>"If there is really someone who could create such a miracle, then it must be Luo Zheng!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Buzz?"</p>

  <p>At that point, another sun had vanished from the sky. The one who had destroyed them had now eliminated the fourth sun.</p>

  <p>As the suns disappeared one by one, there was less pressure on the masters who used the enchanted barriers.</p>

  <p>Originally, after an enchanted barrier was built, it would only last for a few seconds. Now, it lasted more than a minute. The others took turns to maintain the barrier more easily, and therefore they had time to replenish some divine crystals.</p>

  <p>In that way, they could use the enchanted barriers to keep the people in the North Mysterious City alive.</p>

  <p>The sixth sun...</p>

  <p>The seventh one...</p>

  <p>The eighth one...</p>

  <p>The ninth one...</p>

  <p>The blazing white light eventually got dim as more and more suns were gone. When the last sun was extinguished, the North Unicorn Province returned to its normal state.</p>

  <p>At the same time, everyone saw a black dot glow in the sky. It was the same black light that appeared when a sun had vanished. There had been the black light before, but the light from the other suns had covered it.</p>

  <p>As the black dot flickered, the people in the North Mysterious City also saw a figure as big as an ant that floated in the sky.</p>

  <p>"Someone is there!"</p>

  <p>"Who is there?"</p>

  <p>"This person was beside the suns while the suns were destroyed. Was he the one who extinguished them?"</p>

  <p>The people in the North Mysterious City became excited again, and some of them stared straight at the figure with their eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Auden, Pearce, and the leaders of the Ivory Mountain, Golden Mountain, and the other mountains were utterly shocked.</p>

  <p>"It's Luo Zheng..."</p>

  <p>"It's really him!"</p>

  <p>"He is the savior of our Taiyi Heaven Palace!"</p>

  <p>Goran and the others were even more ecstatic, especially Qiu Yinhe, who was in an extremely good mood at that point.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng descended with the golden bow, more and more people saw and recognized him.</p>

  <p>"It's Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! He did it! He really destroyed the suns!"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>They were unaware that Luo Zheng felt it was easy for him to destroy the nine suns. After all, such a deed was beyond their imagination and understanding. Thus, they considered what he had done as a miracle.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, Luo Zheng's cultivation base was greatly different from that of Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>Even the wisest men among them like Auden and Pearce never thought that Emperor Di Jun already had an invincible nemesis over a thousand divine eras ago, and that nemesis could defeat him easily.</p>

  <p>As for Phoenix, Micah, and the other members of the Jin Wu, they thought of another matter. Since Emperor Di Jun, who was quite familiar with the Nine-Sun World Destruction token, lived in Luo Zheng's body, he must have told Luo Zheng how to extinguish those suns.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>A few moments later, Luo Zheng landed in the middle of the North Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>Thunderous applause echoed in the North Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>After everyone had gone through a life and death crisis, all of them felt truly grateful.</p>

  <p>Even though they could only offer a round of applause now, their cheers were heartfelt.</p>

  <p>Of course, Kenelm, Gant, and Monica were overjoyed. They all ran towards Luo Zheng and enveloped him in a long hug.</p>

  <p>Still, Li Bianxue was confused. She knew that Luo Zheng was a disciple of the Land of Sword Grief, so how did he know those Other Shore Realm warriors? She decided to ask some people, and their answers surprised her more. She didn't know that Luo Zheng had been promoted step by step from the Dragon City...</p>

  <p>There were two words in the Nine-Sun World Destruction token, which were "World Destruction", Those words were enough to prove the token's immense power.</p>

  <p>Just now, a layer of the surface of the entire North Unicorn Province got peeled away.</p>

  <p>As a result, the creatures on the ground of the North Unicorn Province, ranging from small ants in tiny crevices to some rare beasts, all burned to ashes.</p>

  <p>Only a small number of them that hid deep underground had survived.</p>

  <p>Now, the Evil God had been hiding deep beneath the ground and was still in cultivation. He didn't know what had happened in the outside world.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the place the Evil God had chosen was far away from the North Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>If he was in the southwest of the North Unicorn Province, then he would've been in trouble even if he hid deep below the ground.</p>

  <p>That was because the nine suns were up high in the southwest and descended from the sky. In other words, they had targeted the North Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>But now they were gone, and everything looked different from they used to be.</p>

  <p>The ground around the North Mysterious City was burned and had turned into layers of flowing magma. If one stood on the city wall of the North Mysterious City, they would see the vast ocean of magma around them and even feel the heat it emanated. It was like the North Mysterious City had turned into a lonely boat in the middle of the magma sea.</p>

  <p>After the catastrophe was over, the leaders of the mountains brought their men back to the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>The southwestern region of the North Unicorn Province had already become a sea of magma. It was unknown how many years it would take for the magma to solidify.</p>

  <p>Since the magma couldn't trap them, everyone flew up in the air and left the destroyed North Mysterious City.</p>

  <p>Pearce, who flew in front of the others, thought about what the Jin Wu would do next.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had almost taken away all the core members of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Once Emperor Di Jun learned the news, he would naturally be furious and would likely launch an aggressive attack in return.</p>

  <p>And since he was too powerful, no one in the Taiyi Heaven Palace could stop him.</p>

  <p>The mere thought of it made Pearce upset.</p>

  <p>In the next second, a golden sword on his waist glowed and transmitted a wisp of consciousness straight to his mind. It was the distress signal from the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>The leaders of all the mountains also received the signal, and their hearts pounded loudly in their chests.</p>
