<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The current battle was like a tug of war between children and adults.</p>

  <p>There was just too big of a difference between both sides.</p>

  <p>Despite that, the Li Shan mountain still did not give up.</p>

  <p>"Go down!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi yelled and smashed his fist on the ground.</p>

  <p>Then, the black and white pattern of the Eight Diagrams shook violently and unleashed a massive force.</p>

  <p>Kendrick had constructed the spot where he stood, but it appeared that it was about to collapse.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the other Eternal Realm warriors followed suit.</p>

  <p>In the face of almost invincible power, they no longer held back.</p>

  <p>They released all their bloodline theurgies and Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>As a result, the downward force increased explosively.</p>

  <p>The originally rising mountain began to descend slowly.</p>

  <p>However, tens of thousands of the Evil Gods continued to drag the chains upwards.</p>

  <p>One of them did not drag the chains. Instead, he folded his arms and looked down. "I appreciate your effort, but this is useless," he scoffed.</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, he stretched out his hand and grabbed downwards into the air.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>At that moment, the whole Li Shan mountain trembled slightly.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before it stopped falling and slowly rose.</p>

  <p>The Evil God could move directly any space, including the vast land of Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>When he had lifted the Li Shan mountain with tens of thousands of avatars, it was just a trick.</p>

  <p>"Master Fuxi! Let the Primeval Lord of Heaven descend," Luo Zheng said to Fuxi telepathically.</p>

  <p>"I... I've already informed him of the situation here. He is still trying to figure out a way," Fuxi answered.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was only at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>He might be stronger than the Eternal Realm warriors of Li Shan mountain in terms of strength, but it was useless.</p>

  <p>One more Eternal Realm warrior could not reverse the situation.</p>

  <p>"Ask him to come now!" Luo Zheng urged.</p>

  <p>At that point, Fuxi's mind was a mess. All he wanted to do now was maximize his strength for the fight. When Luo Zheng urged him, he activated the Descending Ring.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>A beam of golden light flashed, then the Primeval Lord of Heaven descended upon the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Fuxi had informed him of the situation in the Li Shan mountain through the Descending Ring, so he roughly knew what had happened.</p>

  <p>As soon as he arrived, however, he was still shocked when he saw the enormous mountain rising upward. The situation was worse than he had imagined!</p>

  <p>"A helper from the Other Shore?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God's voice rang throughout the sky. He saw how extraordinarily powerful the Primeval Lord of Heaven was, and his aura was even comparable to that of the Grandmaster of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked up at the Evil God, and cursed loudly, "Evil man!"</p>

  <p>Right after that, he disappeared.</p>

  <p>He returned to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It made the Evil God confused.</p>

  <p>This seemingly powerful man turned out to be rather timid. He ran away without even making a move!</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng and Fuxi were rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>What was the Primeval Lord of Heaven up to?</p>

  <p>Not long after, Fuxi glanced up with a strange expression. "Look?"</p>

  <p>The Descending Ring flashed again.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Upon seeing what happened, Fuxi threw the Descending Ring away.</p>

  <p>Then, the Descending Ring unleashed a strange aura, and a massive creature appeared on the Li Shan mountain. It was the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>As an experienced fighter, the Primeval Lord of Heaven knew well that the Source World was a primitive land, which was difficult to resist.</p>

  <p>Thus, in a moment of desperation, he could only ask the Monkey Spirit King for help.</p>

  <p>He had already wanted to try it, but he never actually thought that the Monkey Spirit King was quite friendly.</p>

  <p>When the Monkey Spirit King heard that Luo Zheng was in danger, he agreed without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven just went to check the current situation, then he handed the Descending Ring over to the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"Are you the evil side of the world?" the Monkey Spirit King asked as he looked at the avatars of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The negative emotions of a world were not a new thing.</p>

  <p>The Four Spirits Sect had witnessed such emotions since they had built many worlds.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King never cared about those things, but he had fought many evil creatures from various worlds, so he could tell the Evil God's origin at a glance.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>The avatars of the Evil God looked at the Monkey Spirit King, and all their arrogance was gone.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had keen senses and particularly sharp eyes.</p>

  <p>He felt an indescribable aura from this extraordinarily giant ape. He truly admired such powerful strength.</p>

  <p>Even the Grandmaster of Heaven and the Primeval Lord of Heaven could not make him feel the same things, but this giant ape had done it.</p>

  <p>What kind of creature was this?</p>

  <p>He was not the only one who was puzzled, though.</p>

  <p>There were many warriors at the Holy Soul Realm on the Li Shan mountain, who all looked at the Monkey Spirit King in disbelief.</p>

  <p>His unparalleled strength shocked them hugely.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Monkey Spirit King grinned and ignored the Evil God.</p>

  <p>For him, an evil creature from a small energy pool was not even worth mentioning.</p>

  <p>Still, it did not mean that it was easy to kill the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Since the Primeval Lord of Heaven had asked him for help, he would use the simplest way to solve the problem.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>To do so, he stretched out his hands and fiercely slapped the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Before he did that, Kendrick temporarily removed the three enchanted barriers. Otherwise, the barriers would collapse under his slap.</p>

  <p>The moment he slapped the mountain, two palm prints with a diameter of ten thousand miles appeared, his enormous body at the center.</p>

  <p>Even if the palm prints were quite huge and he applied the power evenly across the mountain, many parts of the mountain still collapsed.</p>

  <p>Large boulders submerged some large cities, and violent earthquakes killed multitudes of mortals in the cities. Millions of people had died or gotten injured. Today was a disaster for the disciples of the Li Shan mountain, and it was the end for the ordinary people who were born and raised in this place.</p>

  <p>Afterward, the Li Shan mountain, which the Evil God had dragged upwards, began to sink quickly.</p>

  <p>The speed at which it sank far exceeded the rate before and even tens of thousands of Evil Gods in the sky fell.</p>

  <p>Indeed, the Monkey Spirit King's power had fully reversed the situation.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape? It's not that easy!"</p>

  <p>One of the Evil Gods gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p>He wanted to use the power of the Source World to keep the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Yet, even if the locked space was powerful, it was useless against the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the force continually tore the locked space apart, while blue lightning kept shooting out from the area around the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the Li Shan mountain finally sank to the ground, passed through the shallow earth, and fell out from the chaos.</p>

  <p>As for the Source World, its vast territory floated above everyone's head.</p>

  <p>The people below it could not see its entirety from such an angle. They only saw a big, circular hole in the place where the Li Shan mountain was formerly located.</p>

  <p>When the Li Shan mountain fell out of the Source World, so did tens of thousands of Evil Gods.</p>

  <p>After they left the Source World, the space chains on the Evil Gods' bodies immediately disappeared. At the same time, the effect of possession also faded away, and they returned to their original appearances.</p>

  <p>The only thing was that they had no idea that the Evil God had possessed them, nor did they know why they floated between the Li Shan mountain and the Source World. They felt confused.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>They heard an odd sound, and fortunately, Kendrick responded fast.</p>

  <p>Before the chaotic energy swept towards these tens of thousands of people, an enchanted barrier had already enveloped them and immediately pulled them back to the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Zheng and the others sigh in relief.</p>

  <p>Although the Li Shan mountain suffered many losses, they still managed to get out of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to settle down, they heard the Evil God's roaring voice from the gap in the Source World. "You want to escape? No way!"</p>

  <p>Then, the gap in the Source World cracked until it formed a large mouth.</p>

  <p>The mouth, which spanned across about seven provinces, bit towards the Li Shan mountain like a shark preying on small fish.</p>
