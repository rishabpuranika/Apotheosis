<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2155 Battle Between Two Warriors (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the fourth floor of the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, a robust proving godly warrior coldly snorted as he reached into his pocket to take out a divine might coin.</p>

  <p>The black divine might coin rolled downward and began falling from the fourth floor. Simultaneously, the proving godly warrior shouted, "I, Steve Sun, accept the challenge!"</p>

  <p>With that, the divine might coin that was falling to the ground was suddenly stopped in mid-air, caught by a mysterious power.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that Steve jumped down from the fourth floor. He tapped the divine might coin with his toe, using it as a stepping stone.</p>

  <p>With his newfound momentum, he landed in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant's patio.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The divine might coin that had been hovering motionless in the air circled on itself a little before flying up toward the sky, zooming past the tall buildings in the Six-Burden Divine City and finally landing in front of a slate. In front of the slate, the densely packed divine might coins formed a small mountain, and there were at least ten thousand divine might coins.</p>

  <p>"That divine might coin... It has been taken away by the power of the Thousand Commandments Slate, right?" Luo Luo Zheng asked Master Evil in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Of course, once they've paid two divine might coins, the two warriors can fight each other, but still, they cannot make any move against others," Master Evil said.</p>

  <p>The delicacies that Luo Luo Zheng had ordered were yet to be served, but at least now, there was an interesting show to watch.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng felt very confident that there wouldn't be much of a problem with his entering the Heavenly Han House, he still felt the need to know the abilities of the talents of the divine land.</p>

  <p>"The Sun and Qian Clans have begun fighting each other once again..."</p>

  <p>"They fight against each other almost every year. I wonder why these two clans never get bored!"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't understand. Victory or defeat between these two great clans is very important to them."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's ears perked up as he heard people chatting a little further off, and his face displayed a hint of curiosity. He stuck to the conversation at hand, and said, "Sounds to me like there's a grudge between the Sun and Qian Clans. Am I wrong?"</p>

  <p>"The grudge between these two clans has probably existed for a very long time. In fact, I had already been aware of that when I was still in the Vast Sky Region seven divine eras ago," Master Evil laughed.</p>

  <p>As it turned out, the Vast Sky Region was controlled by the three great clans and each clan occupied two of the divine cities.</p>

  <p>The divine city was very important to all the third-tier clans across the divine land. The vast majority of the divine might coins were obtained from these divine cities. The Sun, Qian, and Yang Clans each respectively owned two divine cities. More so, there was a central divine city in the Vast Sky Region, which was known as the Heavenly Canopy Divine City.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Canopy Divine City had a Hundred Commandments Slate.</p>

  <p>Regardless of size or area, this slate was much bigger than those of the other six divine cities, and the amount of divine might coins it could earn was only naturally much higher.</p>

  <p>Back in the day, the Han Clan hadn't declared which clan owned the Heavenly Canopy Divine City, and thus, the Sun, Qian, and Yang Clans were constantly arguing over the issue. Most of the time, this constant quarreling led to a battle.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Yang Clan couldn't hold on any longer and left the raging battle for Heavenly Canopy Divine City instead. By doing so, the Sun and Qian Clans' battle became even more intense.</p>

  <p>Overall though, the two great clans had still alarmed the Han Clan, and the Han Clan ultimately settled this dispute. Furthermore, they were also obligated to create a new rule: Every year before the Heavenly Han House admitted disciples by examination, the Sun and Qian Clans should each send three warriors to battle one another for the ownership of the Heavenly Canopy Divine City.</p>

  <p>With such a rule, it was only natural for the Sun and Qian Clans to understand the importance of nurturing their juniors, and thus poured many resources into their disciples. In the eyes of these two clans, entering the Heavenly Han House was only their secondary objective.</p>

  <p>Actually winning the control of the Heavenly Canopy Divine City was first and foremost.</p>

  <p>And this explained why Luo Luo Zheng would have the chance to watch such a scene play out today.</p>

  <p>"In other words, the two chosen ones should be the most powerful proving godly warriors from the Qian and Sun Clans?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Two of the most powerful, yes," replied Master Evil, with a chilling smile.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng and Master Evil discussed, the battle in the patio before them had already begun.</p>

  <p>Steve took a single step forward and headed straight for Holt. In his hand was a shining golden spear. This spear's shape was a bit strange, though.</p>

  <p>It was curved like a snake's body, and it looked like a triangular golden snake's head had been embedded into the spear head.</p>

  <p>"Coiling Dragon Spear," Steve shouted.</p>

  <p>Although they were only sparring here in the Brilliant Moon Restaurant, it still remained a duel once the divine might coins were paid up.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, it was normal for warriors to die in a duel, especially when one of the two didn't hold back.</p>

  <p>That curved long spear stabbed outward like a snake launching out at its prey. His spear appeared to be aimed directly at Holt's head, but with a gentle twist of his wrist, it was actually aiming at his chest.</p>

  <p>"Wow! What an excellent move!"</p>

  <p>"The Sun Clan's Coiling Dragon Spear is famous for its strange shape which makes it extremely difficult to dodge its attack."</p>

  <p>"Look! With Steve's momentum, I'm afraid that the Sun Clan will remain in control of the Heavenly Canopy Divine City..."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing such comments, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but roll his eyes in annoyance.</p>

  <p>Although he had just arrived at the divine land, he had already had the chance to see the strength of the divine land's martial artists in the Misty Mountain Village.</p>
