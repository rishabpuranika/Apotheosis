<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng could understand the reason behind Gant's growing anxiety.</p>

  <p>Although the eight weapon refiners were formidable, they were still no match for the woman with wings.</p>

  <p>It was almost impossible for Gant and Zheng to move past the woman and reach the array relying on their current strength.</p>

  <p>Analyzing the situation, Zheng realized the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array would prove insufficient to kill the woman even if Gant joined the eight weapon refiners and combined their strength with his.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master, please..." Gant pleaded again.</p>

  <p>"If we go there, you might get killed along with them. Aren't you afraid of death?" Zheng asked as he narrowed his gaze.</p>

  <p>Gant stood his ground and said, "I'm not afraid of death. If I watch them die in front of me, then my life will be more painful than death itself."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Zheng raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>He realized he would have made the same choice if their roles were reversed.</p>

  <p>"Okay, I'll help you."</p>

  <p>Zheng was capable of holding his own against the woman, and he even had a few methods up his sleeve on escaping.</p>

  <p>However, he was unable to take Gant with him then. Therefore, he wanted to make sure if Gant had the resolve to face the woman without fearing death.</p>

  <p>Observing Gant's unwavering determination, Zheng decided to help him. He reached for Gant's shoulders with his hands and gripped them firmly.</p>

  <p>Before Gant could react, he felt a strong surge of power flowing from Zheng's hands. He looked down and watched the ground beneath his feet shrink as they ascended to the sky.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The two of them flew across the sky like a flash of light and rushed towards the hillside.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the woman with wings and the eight weapon refiners were in a stalemate. Upon seeing the flash of light, both sides stood stunned and paused to stare at it to make out what that was.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?"</p>

  <p>"It's Gant! What is he doing?"</p>

  <p>"He wants to come to us and enter the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array!"</p>

  <p>Gant's uncles and other people reflected expressions of happiness on their faces upon seeing him.</p>

  <p>To reach its full potential, the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array required nine warriors. If Gant were to join them, the power of the array would increase substantially, and they would have a better chance of survival.</p>

  <p>Studying the situation, Cailen yelled desperately, "No! Turn back! Don't come here!"</p>

  <p>The divine flame was overwhelming. If warriors were inflicted with it, they would surely die. Gant could never survive it. Now that the woman knew the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array was short of one person to reach its true potential, she was not going to let Gant pass and would kill Zheng and Gant without mercy.</p>

  <p>Watching them draw closer, the woman flashed a wicked grin. "I like young people; they don't know what fear is."</p>

  <p>With that, she flicked her fingers.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A golden feather, engulfed in fierce divine flames shot towards Gant and Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Go back!"</p>

  <p>Cailen exclaimed again as he felt his knees tremble at this scene. His eyes were ablaze, and his roar could shake the earth. Above everything, he did not want to see his son die.</p>

  <p>What made it worse was the fact that he was helpless. He could not save him even if he wanted to.</p>

  <p>The intense situation quickened the heartbeats of everyone who witnessed it. Two weapon refiners from the Oneness Sky Palace prayed under their breath, hoping Gant would seize the moment to come for their aid and enter the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the fireball struck Zheng in an attempt to burn him and Gant.</p>

  <p>Gant's hair and clothes quickly caught on fire from the impact before it could reach his entire body.</p>

  <p>Seeing his son go up in flames, Cailen closed his eyes and refused to watch further. After witnessing the tragic scene, the other weapon refiners let out a deep sigh in unison and lowered their gaze to the ground.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng took advantage of the moment and used his reflexes to throw Gant in the direction of the array.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Gant flew across the sky like a burning fireball towards the array and landed face-first on the ground.</p>

  <p>It appeared the fire that cloaked his body was not divine flame, but ordinary. It was quickly put out by the wind as he crash-landed inside the array with his charred body.</p>

  <p>Gant lay stunned with his body planted on the ground. When he regained consciousness, he noticed he was inside the array.</p>

  <p>Instinctively, he got up and turned his head to look for Zheng. As he ran a quick scan of the area, a huge golden ball of fire enveloped his field of vision.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master!"</p>

  <p>Gant clenched his fists with a bewildered expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Cailen could not believe his eyes. 'Why did that guy sacrifice himself to let Gant in?' he pondered to himself.</p>

  <p>Despite the golden flames wrapped around Zheng's body, he continued moving forward.</p>

  <p>The people in the array could only watch helplessly as the ball of fire moved forward slowly.</p>

  <p>Its path was charred and black from the ashes the fireball left behind.</p>

  <p>Gant stared at Zheng's tenacity and murmured, "Flag Master is so tough..."</p>

  <p>Normally, no one could withstand the vigor of the divine flames for more than three seconds. While Zheng was out there holding his own against the fire, Gant was touched by his sheer will and drive to not give up.</p>

  <p>Even the woman with wings was moved at this sight.</p>

  <p>It was unimaginable to think a human warrior below the eighth stage of the Other Shore Realm could resist the divine flames. However, this man was fully covered in the fire. How was he able to last so long?</p>

  <p>It was impossible!</p>

  <p>Impressed by Zheng's resolve, the woman halted her attacks towards him to see how long he lasted till he turned to ashes and dust.</p>

  <p>She wanted to wait to collect his remains, no matter how long it took the fire to kill him.</p>

  <p>'No one could withstand the divine flames when they have just entered the Other Shore Realm. Such a rare incident should be reported to Master Elizabeth, ' the woman thought to herself.</p>

  <p>Under the watchful eyes of the onlookers, Zheng proceeded with caution.</p>

  <p>However, the closer he got to the array, the more he struggled with his steps. His expression showed signs of exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"Is he getting slower and slower?"</p>

  <p>The woman smirked to herself. He was indeed a unique human warrior to be able to stay alive under the influence of the divine flames for over thirty seconds, but alas, he would have to die in the end.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, what she saw next almost made her eyeballs pop out of their sockets.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng was a few dozen feet away from the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array, he hastened his steps and rushed into it.</p>

  <p>Just before entering it, he turned around to face the woman and absorbed the divine flames surrounding him into his body. He flashed a mocking smile at the woman as golden aura now surged from his body.</p>

  <p>Zheng's mocking smile wiped the smirk off the woman's face. Fuming with anger, she realized she had been tricked by him.</p>

  <p>Originating from the proud Sun Crow race, she could tolerate failure, but being fooled by a mere human who just entered the Other Shore Realm did not sit right with her.</p>

  <p>"Brat! You tricked me!" she snapped at him.</p>

  <p>Zheng shrugged his shoulders and said indifferently, "If I hadn't done that, how could I have gotten into the array?"</p>

  <p>"You..." The feeling of getting duped fueled her anger. "You're courting death! You think the array can protect you? We'll see who gets the last laugh!"</p>

  <p>After she attempted to spite Zheng, the golden aura surrounding her body began to flicker. Heat gushed out from her as she roared in rage.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Cailen and the other weapon refiners also eyed Zheng up with astonishment. They were terrified of his abilities and thought he was some nonhuman creature.</p>

  <p>The weapon refiners were well-acquainted with the divine flames, which was how they were able to keep them from breaking into the Nine Edges Heaven Slaughtering Array.</p>

  <p>It would have been easier to break through the array if a master at the same cultivation level as the woman appeared and attacked with a different method and not the divine flames.</p>

  <p>The technique of the Sun Crow race, known as the divine flame, was well-known. Apart from its deadly use, it was also suitable for refining weapons.</p>

  <p>As a result, the weapon refiners from both the Su Clan and the Oneness Sky Palace were familiar with its foundations and could counter it.</p>

  <p>Zheng had run all the way towards the array submerged in the divine flames before absorbing them completely. Just what was his body made up of?</p>
