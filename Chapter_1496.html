<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1496 Warning (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although the Celestial Position was effectively a multi-racial group and was generally tolerant of the differences of their members' origins, their relationship with the ogres was extremely bad.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Marcello's gaze was hard and cold, "What did you say?</p>

  <p>Have a finger in the pie?" He scoffed and continued, "Our race has been involved from the very beginning, and yet we won't demand anything from the young man."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Ranell asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords listened intently, also perplexed by Marcello's words.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position Supreme Lord pointed at the tiny grain of sand that slowly spun in space, "Because the young man in this space treasure is a member of our race!"</p>

  <p>This declaration surprised and displeased the Supreme Lords present.</p>

  <p>"A member of your race? I don't believe it! I'll say he's a member of the ogres then!" Ranell snorted.</p>

  <p>The other Supreme Lords quickly sided with him. They were simply unwilling to believe Marcello's words.</p>

  <p>However, Marcello remained a picture of calm despite the disbelief from the other Supreme Lords, "Luo Zheng passed our race's test and has obtained the golden Celestial Position title. He is a significant member of our race."</p>

  <p>This revelation surprised the other Supreme Lords greatly. Golden Celestial Position titles were extremely rare and appeared only a few times during this grand era. However, they were quick to hide their surprise and replace it with their skeptic looks.</p>

  <p>Who knew if Marcello was merely speaking nonsense? Did he want to take this young man away with this casual excuse? What if his real agenda was to take the Crown of Destiny and the space treasure all to himself? Ha! In his dreams!</p>

  <p>"So what if it's a golden Celestial Position title?" a Supreme Lord uttered with disdain.</p>

  <p>Marcello smiled, already catching on as to where this hostility was coming from. "Don't worry, I'm not here to fight with you over the Crown of Destiny. Although it's important, our race doesn't take it that seriously!"</p>

  <p>Another Supreme Lord snorted, "You don't have to pretend to be so aloof. Just tell us why you came here."</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position was an unconventional race. They did not care about the expansion of their forces unlike the other races and often did things that an outsider couldn't understand.</p>

  <p>They had a habit of occasionally giving up some of their supreme worlds to share with other races, not to mention a few other crazier acts�</p>

  <p>"I have something to say to everyone here," Marcello declared in an incredibly serious tone.</p>

  <p>"What's it?" Addison asked.</p>

  <p>"If any of you dare to harm a single hair on Zheng's head then the Celestial Position race will not hesitate to kill you, even if you are a Supreme Lord."</p>

  <p>The declaration stunned the Supreme Lords present but their surprise quickly evaporated with rage.</p>

  <p>"Do you actually think you have the qualifications to threaten us?" a Supreme Lord sneered.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that the universe belongs to your race? Do you think you have the power to decide our fates?" another asked in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>Killing a Supreme Lord was no easy feat. A war amongst their ranks was no simple manner and often spelled disaster for the 100, 000 supreme worlds. When two mighty Supreme Lords fought, countless lives often ended up being forfeited in the midst of the battle.</p>

  <p>But Marcello merely shrugged, "It wasn't said by me. It came from the old man, the head of our race."</p>

  <p>The head of the Celestial Position race�</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords immediately fell silent.</p>

  <p>The head of the Celestial Position race was a great figure. He was easily placed the same level as the leaders of the three greatest human forces� the Supreme Lord of Oracle, the Supreme Lord of Original Sin, and the Supreme Lord of Thunder Law� as well as the Demon Night race's Supreme Lord Giovani and the ogres' Supreme Lord Mathias.</p>

  <p>These six leaders were the only top-rank Supreme Lords in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>Their reactions were simply brushed off by Marcello. "I also have a message for you, Luo Zheng," he said, looking towards the grain of sand. "Our head hopes that you will pay a visit to our race when you have the time.</p>

  <p>It would be better if you come before the Illusion Battlefield begins. The old man has something important to discuss with you."</p>

  <p>After that, he shot a sideways glance to the other Supreme Lords before turning into a speck of light and disappearing from everyone's sight, leaving just as quickly as he came.</p>

  <p>It wasn't anything new. The members of the Celestial Position race were always like that.</p>

  <p>Back to the matter at hand: the Supreme Lords now knew they had to leave Luo Zheng alone lest they drew the ire of the Celestial Position race head.</p>

  <p>That old man's background was too mysterious and it would be unwise for them to provoke him.</p>

  <p>However, the Crown of Destiny and the fairy palace were still fair game.</p>

  <p>They did not care for Zheng's life at all.</p>

  <p>Except maybe Yao.</p>

  <p>How could she kill Xun without killing Luo Zheng after all?</p>

  <p>The Demon Night race always had an amicable relationship with the Celestial Position race. Nearly one-third of the Demon Night's young geniuses accepted the test and trials of the Celestial Position race before becoming famous. Some returned to the Demon Night while the rest continued to stay in the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>This symbiotic relationship between the two races would no doubt come to an end if Yao killed Luo Zheng. She was now currently at a loss as to what she should do.</p>

  <p>"Hey, human boy, did you hear that? The Celestial Position race will protect your life. You better leave that fairy palace now and we'll spare you. Otherwise, I'll cut off the vitality between heaven and earth and you'll be trapped inside there for a million years! Remember, you're only at the Soul Sea Realm! Your lifespan will not exceed one hundred thousand years!" a Supreme Lord threatened. The Celestial Position race's warning did not deter them in the slightest to attain their goal.</p>

  <p>These Supreme Lords had endless time to confront Luo Zheng here.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think the words of the Celestial Position race head would be enough to scare us?" Ranell sneered. "Let's see just how long you'll last, human boy!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed when he heard their threats. He quickly turned to Saul, "Looks like there's no need for me to hesitate. Since these fellows are too stubborn, then just do as you've suggested earlier!"</p>

  <p>Saul smiled, "You are too merciful. It's no big deal to kill several Supreme Lords. What's more, their death would mean more Crowns of Destiny. I can't wait to see what interesting things will happen after that."</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a beam of light suddenly shot out from the grain of sand. It had burst out so suddenly that the Supreme Lords didn't even have the time to react to it.</p>
