<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As soon as Divine Farmer devoured the Evil God, a new Evil God quickly materialized right in front of him. He was extremely dumbfounded at this strange phenomenon.</p>

  <p>He refused to believe that the Evil God had the ability to be reborn an infinite number of times. He indignantly took a step forward and once again grabbed the Evil God with his massive arms, stuffing him into his humongous mouth.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>After he had torn and ground the Evil God's body with his sharp teeth, Divine Farmer quickly swallowed the mass of flesh and bones into his stomach.</p>

  <p>However, just as the second Evil God's body had settled in his stomach, one of the guards transformed into a new Evil God, the same smug smile stamped on his face.</p>

  <p>'What the hell just happened? How was he able to do that?' Divine Farmer thought incredulously.</p>

  <p>Tendrils of fear slowly crept in his mind, but the shame of feeling this fear inside him infuriated him more. Once again, he charged towards the next incarnation of Evil God.</p>

  <p>The third, fourth, and fifth Evil Gods were quickly devoured by Divine Farmer, one after the other.</p>

  <p>This went on until the last guard on the city wall had been transformed, and subsequently, consumed. There was no Evil God in sight, and Divine Farmer thought he had seen the last of him.</p>

  <p>However, even before Divine Farmer had a moment to release a sigh of relief, a dozen more people emerged as they climbed up from the other side of the city wall.</p>

  <p>All of these people were just ordinary citizens from Moon Shield City, with no capability to even reach the True God Realm in their original state. But when they reached the top of the city wall after their ascent, their bodies twitched and transformed into more clones of the Evil God.</p>

  <p>"Did you turn them all into replicas of yourself?" Divine Farmer was starting to lose his mind.</p>

  <p>He believed that the real Evil God must be hiding somewhere nearby, controlling these replicas remotely.</p>

  <p>The only way he could win was if he found and killed the real Evil God!</p>

  <p>"Replicas?"</p>

  <p>The front-most Evil God slowly raised his hand, a mass of Ways-blending Energy slowly swirled in his palm. "You should have known by now that each of us is a real me."</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer was at a loss for words.</p>

  <p>He was proud of his sharp teeth that could tear almost everything in the world.</p>

  <p>Although the Evil God's body was nowhere near as strong as Luo Zheng's, its toughness was comparable to the bodies of Holy Soul Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>When Divine Farmer devoured what he thought were replicas, he had already sensed that each one of them was equivalent in strength to the Evil God himself!</p>

  <p>There wasn't anyone else who had the ability to create such powerful replicas.</p>

  <p>"You can revive infinitely using other people's bodies..." Divine Farmer couldn't help but cry out this realization, his voice trembling uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>This realization meant that the Evil God was actually an opponent that could forever evade death. He only needed to constantly copy himself to be invincible.</p>

  <p>"You got that right," the Evil God smiled cruelly.</p>

  <p>He then suddenly lunged towards Divine Farmer, the Ways-blending Energy looked like a comet with a trail of color in the air.</p>

  <p>In an attempt to stop Evil God, Divine Farmer extended his strong arm in front of him to strangle the Evil God's neck, but Evil God was fearless. He slammed the Ways-blending Energy into Divine Farmer's outstretched arm.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer had snapped the Evil God's neck like a wooden branch.</p>

  <p>However, the Ways-blending Energy had already exploded and ravaged Divine Farmer's arm.</p>

  <p>A blindingly bright flash of light suddenly lit up the entire place, and was extinguished as quickly as it came.</p>

  <p>When the explosion had died down, the black crystals that covered Divine Farmer's body had all cracked.</p>

  <p>"My Wonder Body..." Divine Farmer couldn't help but feel heartbroken and depressed as he gazed at his damaged body.</p>

  <p>The Wonder Body was the most powerful form of Divine Farmer's bloodline theurgies. It was even more than ten times stronger than the goat monster he had transformed into.</p>

  <p>Ideally, in his current state, even a Chaos Ancient God would not be able to go head-to-head with him in melee combat. Unfortunately, the Ways-blending Energy was so powerful that it had cracked his body all over.</p>

  <p>"The complete form of the Ways-blending Energy is supposed to be more powerful than this," another Evil God commented as he stealthily approached from behind Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer's reflexes were quick; he turned around and slammed his fist on the Evil God's head. It was smashed into a bloody mist.</p>

  <p>But the Evil God was quicker. He had already landed the Ways-blending Energy on Divine Farmer's back.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>With another bright flash of light and an explosion, several of the black crystals on Divine Farmer's back were also destroyed.</p>

  <p>"The full potential of the Ways-blending Energy's power is yet to be discovered..."</p>

  <p>"But it won't need more than this to finish you..." two more Evil Gods chimed in as they closed in on him from both sides.</p>

  <p>Divine Farmer flinched in the face of such crazy suicide attacks. He tried to retreat and was about to launch himself into the air, but three more Evil Gods suddenly appeared above his head. One of them grabbed his head, while the other two restrained one arm each.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>A few more explosions of Ways-blending Energy reverberated throughout the place.</p>

  <p>Soon, the light died down and the dust eventually settled.</p>

  <p>As if by a miracle, Divine Farmer had managed to escape from the ground and hovered in the air.</p>

  <p>But, alive as he might be, most of the black crystals that covered his body had now been destroyed. Black blood was spurting out of his wounds. He appeared as pitiful as a drowned mouse.</p>

  <p>"How, how were you able to do that?" Divine Farmer gasped, his breathing labored.</p>

  <p>"Given your intelligence, you should have been able to figure that out," a new Evil God said as he materialized in front of Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>"You just can't accept the reality," another Evil God appeared behind him simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Two more loud thuds, and the Divine Farmer's body was injured more drastically.</p>

  <p>His Wonder Body had been blessed with a powerful regeneration ability.</p>

  <p>Even though the black crystals covering him were destroyed, they were able to recover at an extremely rapid speed and quickly reshaped to protect him.</p>

  <p>But there was a limit even with their recovery speed. The Evil God's destructive power clearly overwhelmed Divine Farmer's healing ability.</p>

  <p>Aboard the black ship, Shera's eyes glinted with an unusual light as she commented, "The Evil God wasn't using a resurrection technique. On the contrary, he wasn't killed at all..."</p>

  <p>The former captain smiled and turned to Xuanyuan, "When each and every creature in the world, including us, is a real him, what do you think would be the best way to kill him?"</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan clutched his sword tighter as he blankly observed the battle below.</p>

  <p>From where he was watching, he could see more Evil Gods approaching rapidly towards Divine Farmer from all over Moon Shield City.</p>

  <p>It was such an awe-inspiring scene that Xuanyuan felt a chill run down his spine.</p>

  <p>At that moment, both he and Othniel reached the same conclusion in their minds.</p>

  <p>The only way to definitely kill the Evil God, once and for all, was to destroy the entire Source World.</p>

  <p>Xuanyuan became more frustrated as he further thought about it. He had only just mastered the powerful Life and Death Holy Way, but that was very insignificant compared to the Evil God's miraculous ability.</p>

  <p>"Let's leave this place," Othniel suggested. "We don't have a chance of winning this battle anyway."</p>

  <p>Within the entirety of the Source World's range, the Evil God was practically invincible.</p>

  <p>Right after uttering his pronouncement, Othniel started to employ the truth power.</p>

  <p>He intended to utilize the space power to teleport himself, Xuanyuan, and Divine Farmer away from the place. While he was focused fully on the task at hand, three Evil Gods appeared silently overhead.</p>

  <p>"Why do you want to leave so badly?" one of them asked him.</p>

  <p>With that, they released a massive amount of Ways-blending Energy from their bodies that exploded right above Othniel.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The sky erupted with a blinding white light as if a blazing sun had exploded.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient God's body might be colossal in size but it wasn't significantly stronger than Divine Farmer's body.</p>

  <p>Luckily, and due to his quick reflexes, Othniel was able to duck swiftly when the Ways-blending Energy exploded, and avoid a huge rift that extended dozens of miles above him.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Who are you to stop me from leaving?" Othniel snapped angrily.</p>

  <p>Being the Chaos Ancient God who mastered the space truth gave him the ability to come and go as he wished in the entire chaos. He didn't believe that the Evil God would be able to stop him.</p>

  <p>A significant amount of truth power radiated from his body.</p>

  <p>His gargantuan body started to flicker, as did Xuanyuan and Divine Farmer.</p>

  <p>It went on for several seconds, but they surprisingly remained where they were instead of being teleported away.</p>

  <p>Othniel was paralyzed with shock.</p>

  <p>As a unique being in the chaos, this was the first time that he did not know what to do anymore.</p>

  <p>"What... What did you do?" he asked in a trembling and uneasy voice.</p>

  <p>The annoying smile never left Evil God's face. "Did you really expect the Blood Sea Province to be somewhere you can come and go whenever you wanted to?" he snorted insultingly.</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, they saw that multitudes of people throughout the entire Moon Shield City began to convulse before falling to the ground.</p>

  <p>Pavilions, prisons, streets... They were everywhere.</p>

  <p>When these people stood up, they saw that they were all turned into Evil Gods. They simultaneously used the teleportation technique to quickly reappear upon Othniel's broad back.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, more than ten thousand Evil Gods were now standing on Othniel's back!</p>
