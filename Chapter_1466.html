  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The Power of Three Queens?" Luo Luo Zheng was a little nonplussed, given that he wasn't really expecting anything like that.</p>

  <p>Nodding her head in response, Xun went on and said, "There is but a very small number of Demon Night martial artists who are still preserving the ancient bloodline of the clan, giving them the permission to utilize the Faith Energy stored within the three Pools of Faith of the clan. But, why was it that she chose to stay in the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place?"</p>

  <p>The three Demon Night queens she had just mentioned were being worshiped by over a trillion clansmen who were following them.</p>

  <p>Because of that, the Faith Energy was shooting up at a constant rate.</p>

  <p>Their Faith Energy in particular was quite noteworthy. And the power which they could borrow from the Faith Energy was especially remarkable.</p>

  <p>The Faith Energy was all accumulated together and channeled into the three pools.</p>

  <p>In addition to the three queens who could freely make use of these three pools as they saw fit, there was a handful of martial artists that possessed the ancient Demon Night bloodline. Meaning to say, all of them were also qualified to borrow the Faith Energy from the aforementioned pools.</p>

  <p>They might only be able to borrow a fraction of that Faith Energy, but the amount of energy that erupted was still so terrifying.</p>

  <p>That being said, not a lot of martial artists possessed the ancient Demon Night bloodline. And once they were identified, they would automatically be recruited into the core sacred places of the Demon Night. With that in mind, why on earth would this golden-haired girl bother staying in the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place in the Dark World?</p>

  <p>That was something that kept Xun at a loss.</p>

  <p>After the golden-haired girl was done chanting the obscure ancient words, ripples materialized in the three pools in a faraway space. Two of those headed straight into the Queen of Life and the Queen of Punishment, and immediately after a peculiar refraction, they traveled once more into the endless space to the Dark World, to the underground palace, and to the depths of the Endless Abyss.</p>

  <p>All forms of Faith Energy were under the control of the three queens. In fact, even if the martial artists had the ancient Demon Night bloodline in them, they would still need to get the consent of three queens first before they could actually use the Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>Throughout this entire process, the queens could easily cut off the transmission of the Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>That might have been the case, but the martial artists who possessed the ancient Demon Night bloodline were regarded as great assets to the clan.</p>

  <p>And in reality, they refrained from making use of the Faith Energy unless they were caught between a rock and a hard place. Taking note of the fact that the Faith Energy which could actually be borrowed was just a small amount, the three queens had a tendency to just let the stream of energy flow instead of having it cut off.</p>

  <p>The three pools contained Faith Energies which were different in color.</p>

  <p>The Queen of Life's Faith Energy emitted a faint green light, while that of the Queen of Punishment was azure in color, and lastly, the Queen of Killings' energy was blood-red.</p>

  <p>"Oh? It seems that someone is borrowing the Faith Energy within the Dark World."</p>

  <p>In one of the core supreme worlds of the Demon Night, Yao was seated in a magnificent palace at present. A bit of the Faith Energy in her pool was being extracted and transmitted straight into the distant Dark World.</p>

  <p>A small amount of Faith Energy had been extracted from the Pool of Faith. But since the pool was continuously amassing Faith Energy, a minuscule amount such as that was nothing but a hair off a bull's back.</p>

  <p id="top_23">Even so, Yao was still burning with curiosity. Just who could be drawing out the Faith Energy at this moment?</p>

  <p>Martial artists who possessed the ancient Demon Night bloodline were quite few and far between, meaning to say, seeing the energy being extracted from the pool seldom came to pass.</p>

  <p>Yao decided not to cut off this strand of energy. Instead of doing that, she fused her perception into the flow of energy. And after just a short while, it had been transmitted to a distant location like an arrow from a bow.</p>

  <p>With her life on the line, Lincoln's immense power left the blonde girl with no other choice but to use the Faith Energy. If she were to continue holding back, she feared that she might not make it if she got caught by the frenzied Lincoln.</p>

  <p>However, she never would've imagined that the act of borrowing the Faith Energy could give rise to such a huge problem. In a way, it could even alter the evolution of the universe itself.</p>

  <p>Green and blue Faith Energies had already been extracted. And before long, the third Faith Energy made its way through the endless space and reached the abyss. In spite of that, something completely unexpected happened. This red light didn't go straight into the golden-haired girl's body, and for some reason, it directly reflected onto Luo Zheng's body. After that, it suddenly refracted and surged out towards the girl.</p>

  <p>"Ahh..."</p>

  <p>As she witnessed this, even the girl herself had gotten caught in a daze.</p>

  <p>But as luck would have it, all of the Faith Energies had already been gathered together, forming a three-colored light barrier that surrounded her whole body.</p>

  <p>Even though Lincoln's onslaught was becoming increasingly terrifying, causing the light barrier that materialized to reverberate, it still couldn't manage to shake the light barrier in the slightest.</p>

  <p>The girl opted not to fight back. In a state of bewilderment, her gaze was still completely fixated on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>And it wasn't just her who felt that way. At this moment, the Saint Lord of the Purple Bamboo Sacred Place, who was outside the underground palace, had an extremely dreadful look on her face as well, with hesitation written in her eyes.</p>
