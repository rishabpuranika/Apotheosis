<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What kind of expression is that?"</p>

  <p>A crowd of foreign warriors from the divine land hadn't yet noticed Han Liusu, but her younger sister had.</p>

  <p>For reasons still unknown, her sister's expression felt quite strange to her.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu stared at her little sister and laughed dryly, "You'll understand soon enough, my little sister."</p>

  <p>"Understand what?" asked the purple-robed woman, curiously.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu didn't take the time to explain.</p>

  <p>Instead she thought to herself, 'If only Luo Zheng could just kill Quentin Qin - there will be no better solution. It will save us the future trouble and also cut off my innocent little sister's naive thoughts!'</p>

  <p>Ever since they entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, these two sisters had been going at it like cats and dogs!</p>

  <p>The Qin Clan was of the same level power with the Han Clan, and it had been such a long time since they'd heard of Quentin's notoriety, Han Liusu included.</p>

  <p>Both the Qin and the Han Clans had been married for generations.</p>

  <p>However, Han Liusu had no desire of entrusting her sister to Quentin.</p>

  <p>With so many geniuses in the Qin Clan, any one of them could be considered much more reliable than this fellow.</p>

  <p>Quentin had observed Luo Zheng long enough, and noticing that he hadn't moved in a while, he decided that he had had enough. He could no longer hold himself back!</p>

  <p>As the life vitality within his entire body surged at once, the thin, long sword in his hand suddenly rose up. His killing intent had been stirred, and right now, he lacked any trace of pity. There was no stopping him!</p>

  <p>His sword was extremely fast, and as he thrust it out, it flowed forward smoothly.</p>

  <p>At the same time as his sword flung forward, the surrounding vitality between heaven and earth crazily surged together. Even the black water below the crowd was constantly rippling with energy.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The sword flipped into an upright position and in the blink of an eye, it was already before Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Quentin had underestimated Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If Quentin had been even slightly aware of Zheng's strength and power, he would have never acted in such a way.</p>

  <p>Instead, he would use the supreme primordial weapon in his hand. He'd probably unleash the great Wishing Spell while he was at it, too. He was going to use his strongest powers to fight against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Of course, if he had known about Zheng's performance in the Collapsing Mountain race, he would have simply turned around and run in the opposite direction. How would he have chosen to fight against Luo Zheng, then?</p>

  <p>The key point was that Zheng's cultivation at the Spirit Supreme Realm was too bewitching. In Quentin's current opinion, such an opponent was only a matter of a single sword attack. Even if he had only used a bit of his strength, he felt that killing Luo Zheng should be more than enough.</p>

  <p>This sort of contempt came with a hefty price tag!</p>

  <p>When this new sword appeared only a few feet before him, Luo Zheng only gently waved his hand. Two of his fingers formed what looked like a pair of scissors and his eyes revealed a trace of ridicule.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, Zheng's fingers had already clamped onto the blade.</p>

  <p>Without a single stop or a moment of hesitation, Luo Zheng flipped his hand and the long, thin sword broke apart in an instant. Quentin didn't even have the time to react before Zheng's other hand had reached forward and clasped down on Quentin's neck!</p>

  <p>Then, with a forceful push, Luo Zheng pressed Quentin's head down onto the platform.</p>

  <p>Just like that, Luo Zheng sprinted forward still holding Quentin's handsome face down. As Luo Zheng ran, Quentin's face rubbed directly against the platform.</p>

  <p>When these platforms were built, the people of Skyland race naturally considered their resistance. Though Luo Zheng wasn't using the power of nine stars, a shocking trail of blood was still left on the platform.</p>

  <p>The bloody wound acted like a paint brush as it dragged a heavy, thick line across the platform. The dark red color was extremely rich!</p>

  <p>The group of warriors on the platform had originally been watching the battle with a faint smile on their faces, but now, their expressions were frozen. Everyone stood motionless, like statues. They had never thought Quentin would appear so weak when confronting this secondary creature at Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept Quentin's head pressed against the floor in this way until he reached the edge of the platform. A few of the warriors in the middle took a step back when they saw the building momentum. One of the warriors couldn't avoid the pair in time and was knocked right into the black water by Luo Zheng like a deflated sandbag!</p>

  <p>And just as that warrior slipped into the raging black water, Luo Zheng kicked his foot outward, and Quentin, too, was flung into the black water.</p>

  <p>This black water was all formed from life vitality. In truth, it was a life vitality sea!</p>

  <p>The life vitality sea of Holy Being had almost solidified, turning into everything in the world. The true sea had already disappeared. Only the Skyland race possessed this sea of life vitality, which was currently forming its own Tidal Surge.</p>

  <p>Although falling into the sea was not dangerous, everyone could clearly see that before Quentin tipped over into the sea of life vitality, his face was a bloody mess!</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>The first to react was Liusu's sister.</p>

  <p>Ever since she entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land and encountered Quentin by accident, he had tried to curry favor with her using all sorts of flowery words. She, for the first time, had been deeply immersed in his sweetness.</p>

  <p>Initially, Han Liusu had insisted on bringing her little sister along.</p>

  <p>However, she had refused to listen to Han Liusu and instead, decided to stay and cultivate within the Skyland race.</p>

  <p>Who knew that when she was halfway through her cultivation, her older sister would rush over one day and bring a man with her!</p>

  <p>This man seemed to be a secondary creature� And for a secondary creature to be so arrogant, it was only right for Quentin to teach him a lesson!</p>

  <p>After all, this woman had never experienced anything in her youth. She was immediately fascinated by Quentin, and she viewed him as her own Mr. Right.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that in the blink of an eye, Quentin would be kicked into the black water in such a humiliating manner without any chance of retaliation? This girl was instantly enraged!</p>

  <p>Her dress fluttered as faint green halos of light spread out around her.</p>

  <p>She was getting ready to attack Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But before she could even execute her next movement, she suddenly felt her inner world sealing up. Turning her head, she saw that Han Liusu was holding a rune in her hand.</p>

  <p>"You�"</p>

  <p>Anxious, Liusu's sister's eyebrows shot up.</p>

  <p>"Look!" Han Liusu shrugged her shoulders and pointed at the other side of the platform.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng kicked Quentin over into the black water, the other warriors also took the opportunity to make their moves.</p>

  <p>Almost all of these warriors came from the divine land and they had power and influence. With the influence of their families, it was easy for them to form groups.</p>

  <p>How would the others ever tolerate Zheng's action, as Quentin was considered one of the top warriors in this group?</p>

  <p>But once Luo Zheng had experienced this dramatic increase in power, coupled with the massive increase in body strength, even Skyland race seemed like nothing to Luo Zheng now - let alone these Spirit Transformation Realm warriors!</p>

  <p>If they battled against one another, the result would be tragic.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept his body in motion. No matter what weapon his opponent used, he would break his opponent's attack with a finger and throw a punch out whenever a warrior got too close!</p>

  <p>Like a bolt of lightning, Luo Zheng moved with utmost speed.</p>

  <p>And once again, another weapon broke to pieces, and the warrior was kicked directly into the black water. Under the immense impact, his injuries were far from small.</p>

  <p>Just a simple move on Zheng's behalf was enough to beat them.</p>

  <p>Plop! Plop! Plop�</p>

  <p>Following the sounds of bodies falling into the water, more than half of the warriors on the platform had disappeared in the blink of an eye. Luo Zheng had indeed kicked down twenty to thirty warriors on his own!</p>

  <p>"I, I didn't do anything�"</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng approached a fat warrior. At the man's gloomy words, Luo Zheng stopped his fist directly in front of his face.</p>

  <p>The fatty smiled innocently. When he was about to take his own action, Zheng's punch suddenly exerted inexplicable force and the fatty fell into the black water, his golden axe still attached to his back disappearing into the black water along with him�</p>

  <p>That was when Luo Zheng suddenly spun himself around and swept his gaze across the remaining warriors. "I'm not that cruel. And I don't really want to cut off your feet. You want to get out of here by yourself?" Luo Zheng asked faintly. "Or should I send you off?"</p>

  <p>Everyone, and everything, fell absolutely silent once again.</p>

  <p>"You've proved yourself. You deserve your name. I should have thought of that long ago�" Lone let out a long, hearty sigh.</p>

  <p>Lone had admitted long ago that Luo Zheng was a demon. In fact, the broken sword in his hand was actual proof of such. And yet, he could never have expected that still, even now, he was underestimating this fellow�</p>

  <p>Lucille and Kurt were ready to make their moves.</p>

  <p>However, before they could do anything at all, Luo Zheng had quickly taken care of everything going on in front of him.</p>

  <p>It was hard for the two to describe exactly how they were feeling right now!</p>

  <p>The speed at which Lucille and Kurt entered the sacred place was extremely fast. Through absorbing the Pristine Life Vitality, they also felt that their improvement occurred at great speeds. Now that they saw the method Luo Zheng displayed, their originally somewhat swollen self-confidence was severely damaged.</p>

  <p>If Lucille's and Kurt's improvements were quick, then Zheng's improvements moved at incredible rates. The two were incomparable.</p>

  <p>However, their hearts were still filled with worry.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng currently beat this group of foreign warriors and threw them all into the water, but the Skyland race would not sit idly by. He had no power or influence in this Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, how could the Skyland race members allow Luo Zheng to behave so atrociously here?</p>

  <p>If the people of the Skyland race were to blame him, what would come of Luo Zheng? No matter how powerful he truly was, it was impossible for him to fight against the Skyland race alone, right?</p>

  <p>Together, the three of them grew more worried. And yet, they couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth. Zheng's actions had finally helped them all out!</p>
