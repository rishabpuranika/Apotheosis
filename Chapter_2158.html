  <p>
</p>

  <p>As he ran bravely towards Eric, the large man stretched out his right hand. The brown scales on his right hand began to flicker with a faint luster. Suddenly, a myriad of colors flowed through his right hand.</p>

  <p>"It's a poisonous hand! Watch out!"</p>

  <p>"He cultivates the poison technique. You have to be careful of his right hand!"</p>

  <p>"Those who dare to challenge Eric must be strong."</p>

  <p>The burly man rushed forward. As he pointed his right hand towards Eric, the man tried his best to grab Eric. The air in his palm was foul, and each of his fingers was as thick as an arm. It was not a hand. With its strange appearance, it was clearly the huge claw of a vicious beast!</p>

  <p>Eric stood firmly in the center of the arena. He calmly watched the huge claw approached him. Suddenly, with a callous look in his face, he stretched out his finger and pointed it at the center of the claw.</p>

  <p>Thud!</p>

  <p>The burly man's charge was immediately stopped! Eric's finger landed at the center of the claw. With just his index finger, he had already blocked the claw. At the same time, everyone heard a strange sound, as if some kind of metal vibrated violently.</p>

  <p>Then, circles of black ripples suddenly appeared around the burly man's arm. The ripples were extremely small. Only those with keen eyesight would be able to notice them.</p>

  <p>As soon as the ripples appeared, they began to tighten.</p>

  <p>Rustle!</p>

  <p>Immediately, the sound of a shattered object echoed in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>Something was obviously broken in the man's body!</p>

  <p>The burly man's right hand was chopped into seven or eight pieces. A mixture of shock and pain was seen in his expression as each piece of his right hand fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Ahhh..."</p>

  <p>The burly man let out a loud roar. With a terrified expression, he grabbed his severed right arm and retreated seven to eight steps.</p>

  <p>Usually, the fight should have ended at that moment. Out of politeness and respect, Eric should give the man some time to catch his breath.</p>

  <p>After all, there was no deep-seated hatred between them.</p>

  <p>However, Eric didn't stop at all. While the burly man retreated frantically, Eric walked closer and stretched his finger towards the burly man. If his finger hit the burly man's head, the burly man would definitely be decapitated.</p>

  <p>As he thought of this, the burly man finally understood why no one dared to challenge Eric.</p>

  <p>A deathly pale expression covered the burly man's face. In a moment of desperation, he rolled horizontally on the ground. His legs stomped on the ground abruptly, and his entire body flew forward. Finally, he crashed pathetically into the outside of the patio.</p>

  <p>Some people were eating outside the patio. They were surprised as the burly man suddenly crashed towards their meal. The burly man had smashed his way through quite a few tables under the impact, but he had managed to keep his life in the end.</p>

  <p>As he failed to take the man's life, Eric had a look of regret on his face.</p>

  <p>A disappointed look was on his expression. He gently waved his index finger, and a few black ripples appeared around it. Each of his motions was dangerous as if some kind of sharp tool was attached to his finger.</p>

  <p>"What a vicious young man."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng sit comfortably in his own seat. Nonetheless, his eyes were already focused on Eric's direction.</p>

  <p>Eric had the slightest bit of scruples when he attacked. With a murderous Mu Ning, he wanted to kill his opponent. However, his actions were too excessive under such circumstances.</p>

  <p>The divine might coins in the patio tempted Luo Luo Zheng as well. Such a huge amount would be beneficial to him. Nonetheless, he still had no intention to make a move.</p>

  <p>Just then, the young lady from Brilliant Moon Restaurant led a few waiters to bring many delicate dishes to Luo Luo Zheng. The servants placed the dishes on Luo Zheng's table naturally and smoothly. A marvelous meal was immediately served in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Everyone's attention was originally focused on Eric. Coincidentally, Eric was not far away from Luo Luo Zheng. So Luo Zheng's rather boastful display stole their attention. On the first floor of Brilliant Moon Restaurant, many proving godly warriors only ordered one or two dishes with a few divine might coins. None of them ordered as many dishes as Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even the warriors on the third and fourth floors didn't order so many dishes.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng immediately attracted the attention of all the people in Brilliant Moon Restaurant. Even Eric became interested in Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They all stared intently at Luo Luo Zheng. From head to toe, Luo Luo Zheng was gazed upon by the warriors around him, as if to gauge his worth. When they saw his clothes and face, they all felt he was a stranger. Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng appeared to be an ordinary warrior with a humble background. How could he afford so many dishes?</p>

  <p>"Sir, the dishes you ordered are all here. Please enjoy them." The girl bowed towards Luo Luo Zheng before she left with her servants. Her thought was the same as the others'; she wanted to see how Luo Luo Zheng would settle the bill.</p>

  <p>She even suspected that Luo Luo Zheng might not pay and instead escape after his meal. However, if Luo Luo Zheng didn't have enough divine might coins, the girl had henchmen who were True Gods. Their establishment wouldn't be easy to mess with.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't mind their gazes at all. He casually took a pair of chopsticks and poured himself a cup of wine. A delicious aroma of alcohol filled the air. Then, he pointed his finger towards the cup and a wisp of Fire Law began to spread out.</p>

  <p>Whirl!</p>

  <p>The wine in the cup was lit ablaze. A cyan flame intensely erupted from the cup.</p>
