<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pearce, Auden and the others were shocked. They didn't know what the truth was.</p>

  <p>Slowly, a smile crept on their faces as they watched the golden sword radiance light up the sky.</p>

  <p>"His Majesty has grown stronger on the Other Shore!"</p>

  <p>"Has His Majesty obtained an Other Shore Token that can strengthen the power of his bloodline?"</p>

  <p>"These are Golden Rune Swords... This hasn't been used in ages, yet it's still incredibly powerful. Unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Heaven Palace was not a force made up of members from the same clan. Only those in the Phoenix Palace shared the same bloodline with Eastern Emperor Taiyi, which made his bloodline rare.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>A huge vortex surrounded the Golden Rune Swords, as though energy was constantly being drawn towards its center.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched the vortex as though in a trance. "Master Houyi, Emperor Di Jun," he suddenly said, "does that vortex connect somewhere outside the chaos?"</p>

  <p>Previously, Houyi and Emperor Di Jun had said that the energy in the chaos actually didn't come from the chaos.</p>

  <p>However, the energy that was released was usually too little for people to find out this fact.</p>

  <p>In theory, if the energy was strong enough, a vortex would form, connecting to the outside of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Yet here it was, in the flesh. The power of the Golden Rune Swords was extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" Houyi answered excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Master Houyi, can your Sun Shooting Bow destroy these Golden Rune Swords?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Well..."</p>

  <p>Houyi hesitated. Just then, Emperor Di Jun smiled bitterly and answered for him. "Nonsense. He was just lucky enough in the past to have shot down my suns..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I didn't expect the vortex would be so different from those in the suns," Luo Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>"It's not like that," Emperor Di Jun said. "The energy has different types and comes from different sources. Thus, cutting off the different types of energy will require different methods."</p>

  <p>"In other words, there are ways similar to the Sun Shooting Bow that could be used to suppress the energy?" Luo Zheng raised his brow.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun nodded. "Yes, among us, the one who has studied this the longest time is the Primeval Lord of Heaven. However, despite his wisdom and the countless years he has spent on the research in this field, he's got nothing conclusive."</p>

  <p>"Exploring things outside the chaos from within the chaos is like trying to peep at a leopard using a pipe," Houyi said lazily. "It's guaranteed the results will be inaccurate."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was known for his intelligence. Even the human powerhouses admired him for it. Yet, even a man as intelligent as him couldn't figure out the rules outside the chaos.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Golden light pierced the air as the Golden Rune Swords shot towards the sky.</p>

  <p>Once the swords connected with each other, a powerful aura surged forth and the bright golden light enveloped the world.</p>

  <p>"This is the extreme intent of swordsmanship!"</p>

  <p>"His Majesty has indeed made a breakthrough!"</p>

  <p>"It's too powerful. Emperor Di Jun is definitely no match for him!"</p>

  <p>Watching this beautiful scene unfold before them, the warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace were so giddy with excitement.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the members of the Bearing race trembled in fear, their faces as pale as death.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun was their only hope.</p>

  <p>If he didn't succeed, there was no way the warriors of the Taiyi Heaven Palace would let them go so easily.</p>

  <p>As if the warriors weren't troublesome enough, they also had to face the wrath of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>As the golden light flashed in the sky, suddenly, a huge red fireball appeared.</p>

  <p>It was another sun!</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun sighed bitterly.</p>

  <p>He had just used the Nine-Sun World Destruction token, so it was impossible for him to use it anytime soon.</p>

  <p>Never in his wildest dreams did he expect to face Eastern Emperor Taiyi, or that the fake who was controlling him would be so powerful.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun was confident he knew Eastern Emperor Taiyi better than anyone else.</p>

  <p>Yet, he was perplexed. How could the power of these Golden Rune Swords grow so rapidly?</p>

  <p>The soul curling up inside Eastern Emperor Taiyi's mind must be some kind of monster.</p>

  <p>Just as quickly as the new sun appeared, a strong sword radiance shot out towards it.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun was left with no choice but to use the Grand Teleportation technique. This time, the sword radiance pierced the sun, causing it to burst into flames that quickly sputtered out.</p>

  <p>However, the Golden Rune Swords covered the sky above the Bloom Divine Province. No matter where Emperor Di Jun moved, a Golden Rune Sword would follow.</p>

  <p>Under Eastern Emperor Taiyi's control, the Golden Rune Swords picked up speed with every second that passed? but Emperor Di Jun was also able to teleport just as quickly.</p>

  <p>Buzz buzz buzz buzz...</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun darted across the sky in a flash, disappearing into countless blue squares each time he teleported.</p>

  <p>Above the Clear Lake, the blue squares started to materialize. However, before Emperor Di Jun could even emerge, a golden light shot down from the sky, straight towards the blue squares. Reacting in a flash, Emperor Di Jun disappeared once more.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The golden sword radiance pierced the surface of the water, causing ripples as large as a tsunami to sweep across the land.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the big cities around the Clear Lake had powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>Together, they all took action to prevent the tidal wave from destroying their cities.</p>

  <p>These masters were not too worried about the damages they'd suffer from the tsunami. Rather, they anxiously looked to the sky as they watched streaks of golden light attack a blue figure.</p>

  <p>As the aborigines of the Bloom Divine Province, they could easily tell that the one who was attacking was Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself. As for the blue figure, very few could tell who he was.</p>

  <p>That didn't matter to them. What was most important was for Eastern Emperor Taiyi to win. At least, the Bloom Divine Province would ultimately be safe.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>When Emperor Di Jun teleported away from the Clear Lake, he appeared on a plain in the west. But before he could even catch his breath, a Golden Rune Sword slashed at him.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack</p>

  <p>The blade of the Golden Rune Sword slashed into the ground, and the earth erupted. In the blink of an eye, a canyon was created right next to Emperor Di Jun.</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth angrily, Emperor Di Jun had no choice but to teleport again.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi controlled the Golden Rune Swords easily with his mind.</p>

  <p>"If you were wise, you'd have escaped by now...</p>

  <p>But I know you won't run away." Eastern Emperor Taiyi smiled wickedly.</p>

  <p>"You might've dodged my sword with the help of Grand Teleportation many times, but it's only a matter of time before you tire yourself out."</p>

  <p>As Eastern Emperor Taiyi spoke, countless small squares suddenly materialized behind him.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun's eyes flashed with killing intent as he emerged, poised to land a sneak attack.</p>

  <p>However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi just laughed.</p>

  <p>A huge Golden Rune Sword dashed towards them from the sky, threatening to pierce straight through Emperor Di Jun's head.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun's face fell. Flapping his wings desperately, he managed to narrowly dodge the golden light.</p>

  <p>But at that moment, another Golden Rune Sword came straight at him from behind!</p>

  <p>In a flash, Emperor Di Jun twisted his body to dodge that golden light by a hair.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as he recovered, another sword slashed towards him from the side.</p>

  <p>His expression darkened. There was no way he'd be able to dodge in time.</p>

  <p>He could only turn to protect his vital parts.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Grunting, Emperor Di Jun realized the Golden Rune Sword cut off one of his arms and half of his wing.</p>

  <p>His arm was more than four hundred thousand feet long, and his wing was two million feet long. When they were cut off, they returned to their normal sizes and fell from the sky.</p>

  <p>Blood spurted from his wounds, raining all over the Bloom Divine Province.</p>
