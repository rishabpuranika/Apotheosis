</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon answered Zheng's query. There were differences among supreme worlds. In fact, neither the Genuine Dragon World nor the Purple Power World was considered to be a complete supreme world.</p>

  <p>The mass of vitality of heaven and earth in these two worlds was similar to that of the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded his head in understanding. It was then that the armored warrior saw the reaction of the Soul Sea Realm warriors and laughed out loud. "Look at these fools! Ha-ha! Each time we open a well, we see it happen. It's too funny!"</p>

  <p>The Soul Sea Realm warriors in the well were still angry, but they could not do anything about it. The sensation of their life vitality rolling inside their bodies was too unbearable. No one wished to float up the well.</p>

  <p>"It looks like there aren't any people worth mentioning in this well. All right then. You should slowly get used to it." The armored warrior backed out as he finished speaking.</p>

  <p>Since the enchanted barrier sealing the well had disappeared, there was no need for Zheng to stay in the well water any longer. The Vitality Pressure had no effect on him at all. Quick as a flash, he leaped out of the well and landed next to it.</p>

  <p>His gaze swept across the area, and a look of surprise marred his face.</p>

  <p>He did not expect there to be so many wells around him.</p>

  <p>Next to him were a number of wells densely packed together. Not far away from them were more than ten armored warriors searching along the wells one by one. 'There are a lot of Ascending Wells. Does that mean there are other Soul Sea Realm warriors in each of the wells?</p>

  <p>There could be hundreds of them. That's the number of Soul Sea Realm warriors who have only come from the Lower World, '</p>

  <p>Zheng reflected and could not help but sigh.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, his sudden appearance had alarmed the armored warriors around him.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood by the side of the well and immediately attracted their attention. Under their helmets, their gazes were focused on him, full of astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What? Am I daydreaming?"</p>

  <p>"Wasn't the enchanted barrier just removed from the well? How could someone adapt to the Vitality Pressure in such a short time?"</p>

  <p>"What a strange man!"</p>

  <p>A few of the warriors gazed unblinkingly at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"You all have failed to realize the main point here. This young man is not just strange, he is the strangest of them all. Can't you see? He is only at the Life and Death Realm!" an armored warrior voiced out.</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors were stunned as they realized this.</p>

  <p>The armored warriors were all at the Soul Sea Realm. Their mission was to guide the warriors who had just ascended from the Lower World. Over the years, the number of warriors they guided had only increased.</p>

  <p>A vast majority of the warriors stayed in the wells for ten days to over half a month. The purpose was to gradually let them get used to the vitality between heaven and earth in the Upper World. The next step was to open the enchanted barrier and allow the vitality to flow in, allowing them to adapt to it ever so slowly.</p>

  <p>If a warrior who had just ascended from the Lower World was suddenly thrown into this violent vitality, it would cause the life vitality inside his body to flow backward. The belly was the foundation of a warrior, and every single move within it could impact him majorly. If the life vitality started to flow backward, the warrior could suffer serious injuries at the least, go berserk or die because of belly explosion at the most.</p>

  <p>Thus, after the enchanted barrier was removed, there was usually a period of adaptation for about half a month.</p>

  <p>Those who could adapt well were able to do so within ten days, while those with excellent physiques were able to adapt within seven days.</p>

  <p>There were always some talents in this world who were able to respond positively to the Vitality Pressure within a mere three days.</p>

  <p>However, those warriors were few and far between. After so many years, only one or two of them had made appearances.</p>

  <p>According to some of the older, senior armored warriors, there had once been someone like that who ascended from the Lower World. It was said that he had adapted to the Vitality Pressure within four hours. That man was now the famous Supreme Lord Illusion.</p>

  <p>It had only been less than five minutes now since they had removed the enchanted barrier, and this young man jumped out of the well. He acted like nothing had happened to him.</p>

  <p>What was even more shocking was that he only seemed to be at the Life and Death Realm! Why was a Life and Death Realm warrior able to ascend to the Upper World at all?</p>

  <p>The armored warriors were utterly puzzled. They suspected that something had happened in the universe to change the ascending rules.</p>

  <p>"You!" The armored warrior who had just left the well turned around and trudged toward Zheng. However, his originally formidable aura swiftly weakened as he stepped in front of Zheng. He seemed to not be able to think straight. As he stood before Zheng, he suddenly realized something.</p>

  <p>He could not treat the young man as any other ordinary warrior from the Lower World. Zheng's growth had clearly been astounding, and in future, if he were to make a name for himself, he might become a Supreme Lord or a world lord. Even if he only became a highly-ranked official of some sacred place, he was someone the armored warrior could not afford to offend.</p>

  <p>The armored warrior instantly regretted mocking and ridiculing the warriors in the well when he had removed the enchanted barrier. Now he only hoped that Zheng would not mind what he had said.</p>

  <p>He rushed toward Zheng aggressively, but a smile found its way on his mouth. "My friend! Welcome to the Upper World," he said in a polite tone. "You have become a member of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Unbelievable! You got used to the Vitality Pressure so soon!"</p>

  <p>The armored warrior's attitude had changed so quickly that Zheng sighed deeply in his mind. Although he had loathed the man's words previously, he did not want to argue. "Does the Spiritual Force Sacred Place belong to the human race?" he merely asked in an indifferent manner.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" the armored warrior beamed. "The Spiritual Force Sacred Place is one of the three tenth grade sacred places in the Spirit Reading World."</p>

  <p>A tenth grade sacred place!</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. The four divine kingdoms could barely be called eighth grade sacred places. Perhaps a tenth grade sacred place was considered the peak among the sacred places. He wondered how big this Spiritual Force Sacred Place was and how many powerful warriors lived here.</p>

  <p>When the armored warrior realized that Zheng had no intentions of rebuking him, he took out a pair of black shackles and waved them. "I'm sorry, but please let me handcuff you," he said.</p>

  <p>Zheng's brow creased at the sight of the shackles. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Noticing Zheng's unfriendly expression, two armored warriors came over.</p>

  <p>"No offense," one of them said in a no-nonsense tone. "According to the rules of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, anyone who ascends from the Lower World must first be handcuffed and serve the sacred place. Only after meeting certain conditions can they leave!"</p>

  <p>"Is everyone like that?" Zheng's frown deepened.</p>

  <p>His plans had been to achieve his goals one by one after he ascended to the Upper World. He would first become an independent warrior and gain experience before finding out the whereabouts of his sister.</p>

  <p>Once his strength increased, he would be able to help Xun return to the Demon Night race. The best course of action would be to help her get rid of her opponent. Then he would help the cyan dragon build a Heavenly Body.</p>

  <p>Of course, each of these goals was more difficult than the last.</p>

  <p>For instance, Xun's own strength was on par with a world lord, and her opponent's too. With Zheng's current strength, it would be too unrealistic for him to confront a world lord. If he wanted to achieve this goal of his, it would take him a long time.</p>

  <p>As for helping the cyan dragon build a Heavenly Body, it was not going to be simple either. To find Yan would be the hardest to achieve. At the same time, it was his most important aim. The commendable strength of the young man who had her was still imprinted on Zheng's mind. His own strength could not match his one in ten million. The gap between them was just too big.</p>

  <p>Time was still tight for Zheng. He did not feel the slightest bit relaxed.</p>

  <p>He had just ascended to the Upper World, but now he was about to be locked up like a criminal. It would be strange if he were happy to be enslaved.</p>

  <p>Seeing the displeasure on Zheng's face, the armored warriors too grew unhappy. In their eyes, Zheng was perhaps the best among the warriors who had just ascended to the Upper World, but he was still from the Lower World. His cultivation was only at the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>"It is the rule. Regardless of whether or not you follow the rules, you must serve in the sacred place. You have no choice," one of the armored warriors said with a smile. "Don't make things difficult for us now."</p>

  <p>Zheng thought for a moment before nodding in resignation. He extended his hands and allowed the armored warrior to handcuff him.</p>
