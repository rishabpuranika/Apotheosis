<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1753 Exchange Blood </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The purple smoke from the incense burner seeped into Xun's body bit by bit. As it did, her Mu Ning grew stronger.</p>

  <p>The scene drew Luo Luo Zheng in and he wanted to see what was burning within the incense burner. Looking down, he saw a purple crystal as it was being burned by a thin wisp of flame.</p>

  <p>"It's the Candle Dragon Crystal, made from dragon oil. The condensed crystal is very precious and effective in repairing the soul." The cyan dragon's voice resounded in his head. "The value of this small piece of Candle Dragon Crystal is nearly that of a supreme divine weapon."</p>

  <p>"You finally spoke," Luo Luo Zheng remarked.</p>

  <p>Once, the cyan dragon served as Luo Zheng's beacon of sorts, guiding him along his pursuit of the martial arts. But lately, the dragon had been silent.</p>

  <p>The creature knew that Luo Luo Zheng was rather upset about it, but he merely smiled and said, "An ant wants to climb a mountain. If it does not look up and keeps going upward blindly, it will one day cross it. But if you let the little ant know the height of the mountain right away, I think that it will lose the courage to cross it."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng knew that the cyan dragon was talking about him.</p>

  <p>Indeed, knowing what he'd be facing ahead of him could do him more harm than good.</p>

  <p>But still, that didn't stop Luo Zheng's curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Things progressed much quicker than I expected," the cyan dragon sighed. "But that's also good. Soon, you'll start exchanging your blood.</p>

  <p>When you become a member of the Celestial Position, many things will be revealed."</p>

  <p>"Why must I change my blood? To join the Celestial Position?" The thought made Luo Luo Zheng frown. "Can I refuse?"</p>

  <p>Although the Celestial Position had done Luo Luo Zheng some good, he didn't particularly like this kind of mysterious feeling? he always felt like he was in the dark, as if everyone was hiding some sort of conspiracy.</p>

  <p>"You have to exchange your blood, but this has nothing to do with you joining the Celestial Position," said the dragon.</p>

  <p>"Can't you explain it to me? Clearly?" All he wanted was the truth? Luo Luo Zheng didn't want to be stuck in the dark any longer.</p>

  <p>"The blood of the Celestial Position race is very special. It will increase your strength and more importantly, it can hide you from others."</p>

  <p>And the people he was referring to were probably those whose identity couldn't yet be revealed. His response made Luo Zheng's eyes roll? he simply couldn't be bothered to find out who these people were. In any case, the dragon wasn't going to tell him anything, even if he asked.</p>

  <p>Getting a sense of Luo Zheng's emotions, the cyan dragon immediately said,</p>

  <p>"They've made a move against you before. They probably thought they have already destroyed you? In truth, you really shouldn't have gone to the Illusion Battlefield to fight for the champion. It was too conspicuous?it put the Celestial Position in an awkward situation too."</p>

  <p>"They've made a move against me before?" Luo Luo Zheng asked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Yes, when you were on the Divine Kingdom Continent."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he recalled the terrifying attack. That regular black thread had unimaginable power? it had destroyed all the mountains in the great world.</p>

  <p>"That was negligence? there are thousands upon thousands of seedlings like you in the great worlds? But most of them don't have the chance to grow. Even if they had, they'd be killed during the Heavenly Tribulations once they were discovered. But you managed to withstand it, so you now have the initiative," the dragon added.</p>

  <p>Thousands upon thousands?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt that he had received another piece to the puzzle.</p>

  <p>There were other people like him? What exactly did the big boss behind this want to do by paying such a heavy price?</p>

  <p>It couldn't be to kill a True God, could it?</p>

  <p>Even if it was to kill a True God, there was no need to pay such a huge price.</p>

  <p>Gradually, Luo Luo Zheng could faintly see the tip of the iceberg of the whole ordeal? he realized that the mountain in front of him was truly unimaginably tall.</p>

  <p>"Your blood must be changed. This is a crucial part," the cyan dragon warned.</p>

  <p>No longer refuting him, Luo Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>To reach the end of his path, he needed to place his trust in some people, or at the very least, the cyan dragon and Xun. There might have been things that Xun failed to explain, but even if he was deceived, he knew that he would still stand firmly beside her.</p>

  <p>Three days later, the Candle Dragon Crystal in the incense burner was almost completely burnt; its purple smoke also dispersed.</p>

  <p>But Xun remained in a deep sleep, her face still peaceful and undisturbed.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't know if it was an effect of the Candle Dragon Crystal or if she had deliberately refused to wake up, but there was nothing he could do about it except keep her within his body.</p>

  <p>When she was taken into Luo Zheng's body, her eyes opened slightly. Then, she pursed her lips and closed her eyes once again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, some warriors from the Celestial Position arrived once again. As the old man said, today was the day Luo Luo Zheng was to exchange his blood.</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng followed the warriors from the Celestial Position and traveled for millions of miles through the supreme world tunnel. After a day and a half, they finally arrived at their destination.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng was a giant waterfall, rushing down from a mountain tens of thousands of feet above as if an ocean was dammed.</p>

  <p>With such a great force of water falling from above, there should have been a violent, explosive sound. But somehow, the waterfall was so quiet? Luo Luo Zheng couldn't figure out how the Celestial Position had done it.</p>

  <p>"Let's enter," a warrior led the way into the waterfall. The moment he stepped inside, the water parted like curtains as if it knew they were there to enter.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Freya exchanged glances before following the warrior into the waterfall.</p>

  <p>For one thing, Luo Luo Zheng didn't expect to hear a heated argument the moment he stepped inside.</p>

  <p>A towering hall was hidden behind the waterfall? it was magnificent in every angle. Carvings of various dragons, snakes, giant statues of tigers and leopards, and all kinds of legendary ferocious beasts decorated both sides of the gate. Luo Luo Zheng had even spotted the statue of the Mad Scorpion he had once met.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng's attention was drawn in by the ongoing quarrel.</p>

  <p>"I would never agree to let Luo Luo Zheng have such precious blood!"</p>

  <p>"Hmph? does he even have the ability to take it? The Sky Origin Blood is the blood guarded by the Celestial Position race, guarded for years!"</p>

  <p>"Master Feng, if you're not afraid that he'll explode and perish, then exchange the blood for him! Once he dies, we still can take the Sky Origin Blood back!"</p>

  <p>"I'm already starting to suspect the meaning of the Celestial Position race's existence. Master Feng, what are you trying to do?"</p>

  <p>It was more like a siege than a quarrel.</p>

  <p>In the center of this great hall, seven people were gathered, fiercely accusing Master Feng.</p>

  <p>Among them, four of them were grand world lords and the other three were Supreme Lords. One of them, Luo Luo Zheng had seen him before. When he was surrounded by Supreme Lords, it was one of them that had sent the message.</p>

  <p>In truth, Luo Luo Zheng was rather curious. Why didn't Master Feng use the Roaring Token directly? There might have been some hidden reasons. Perhaps the Celestial Position warriors weren't allowed to use Roaring Tokens?</p>

  <p>Seeing Master Feng at a loss for words, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but gloat inwardly. 'You appeared unfathomable before me, yet as one of the most powerful warriors in the universe, you're in trouble now!'</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng has arrived!"</p>

  <p>When the announcement was made, the seven men all turned to look at him.</p>

  <p>These seven warriors were grand world lords or Supreme Lords. One could only imagine just how shocking their auras were when all of them gathered together.</p>

  <p>A single Supreme Lord's soul pressure alone was enough to weaken or even destroy Luo Zheng's soul, let alone seven of them.</p>

  <p>But these seven didn't use such means to suppress Luo Luo Zheng? they were only expressing their emotions with it.</p>

  <p>But even so, the overwhelming auras still came crushing down on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His face instantly turned pale while Freya's legs grew weak before she fainted.</p>

  <p>Seeing her pass out, Luo Zheng's eyebrows furrowed.</p>

  <p>"You old guys must watch your manners! How could you do this?</p>

  <p>They're only kids!"</p>

  <p>With a casual wave of his hand, a warm breeze blew over the area.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Luo Zheng felt the pressure on him lighten, letting him bend down and help Freya up.</p>

  <p>Although he knew that these people were the top-notch characters in the Celestial Position, their actions left Luo Luo Zheng with a negative impression.</p>

  <p>The others glared at him coldly.</p>

  <p>Right after he got there, Luo Luo Zheng heard these people were opposed to the idea of him having some special blood.</p>

  <p>But they couldn't change Master Feng's mind and naturally, they had to keep a straight face in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position warriors' gold blood was divided into three types? Sky Origin Blood, Earth Origin Blood, and Human Origin Blood.</p>

  <p>Most of the Celestial Position warriors exchanged their blood for Human Origin Blood, and a small number of them could exchange theirs for Earth Origin Blood.</p>

  <p>But when it came to the Sky Origin Blood, the Celestial Position had only inherited enough for two warriors. Many years ago, they had used one and now, the leader wanted to give the last one to Luo Luo Zheng. How could the Supreme Lords and grand world lords be happy to hear the news?</p>

  <p>Naturally, they were determined to stop the head of the race from handing anything to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>
