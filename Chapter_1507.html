  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>A mouthful of golden blood sprayed forth from Gus' mouth.</p>

  <p>The Dark and Light energies were very special, and the life form which they created was no different from a real one.</p>

  <p>Gus extended his hand to wipe away the golden blood from the corner of his mouth. A peculiar light flashed through his eyes as he looked at Luo Luo Zheng with new respect.</p>

  <p>"Master always has sharp instincts. You are a talented warrior," Gus commended him. He stood up, regaining his feet and checked his own status. "However, to be able to be accepted by Master as a disciple, one has to be one in a million. Our eldest fellow disciple is a super talent too.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng, I don't think that you can possibly defeat me. I will give you one more chance. Give me a salute, and? "</p>

  <p>Before he could finish speaking, Luo Luo Zheng had already turned around. He controlled his sword which was not in his hand with his mind and made it fly towards Gus. Meanwhile, he himself was flying towards the finishing point of the True Path. He was too bored by this senseless prattle to listen to this fellow.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng's flying figure, Gus gnashed his teeth and chased after him in hot pursuit.</p>

  <p>Ever since he had become a disciple of his master, Gus had been constantly bullied by his eldest fellow disciple.</p>

  <p>Back then, his master had been in his prime years and had wanted to find a successor for his two outstanding cultivation methods.</p>

  <p>His master's first disciple had joined their sect only a few hundred years before Gus did. And because of the gap of a few hundred years, Gus had been bullied by him for countless more years, and he still hadn't been able to turn the tables, even now.</p>

  <p>If this went on, the possibility of him repaying the insults and tortures of the past, would be very small in the future indeed.</p>

  <p>Now that he had finally found a junior fellow disciple, how could he let him go?</p>

  <p>If his original body came into being, he would naturally then be bullying the weak. With Gus' true strength, a single glance would have been enough to instantly kill Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, this body formed by the Dark and Light energies had the same level of cultivation as Luo Luo Zheng. This leveled the playing field.</p>

  <p>"Don't run! Luo Luo Zheng!" Gus suddenly leapt into the air and his strange figure flashed into succession as he easily overtook Luo Luo Zheng and appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng similarly jumped up and circled around him. His sword also arrived at his side. Then, he grabbed onto it and suddenly thrust it at Gus.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's strength exploded out completely in the tremendous strike that followed.</p>

  <p>He was in a different situation than Gus. His only goal was to pass through the True Path. If Gus wanted to provoke him, then Luo Luo Zheng would kill him without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Gus looked at Luo Zheng's sword and a calm smile spread over his face.</p>

  <p>Although he was only at the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm and was about the same level as Luo Luo Zheng, the difference in experience between the two was far greater.</p>

  <p>"This strike is not bad! Master doesn't use a sword, so you must have figured it out by yourself, right? Under this round of heavens, you're also considered one of the top talents."</p>

  <p>Seeing the sword slashing down directly at his head, Gus still did not dodge. Instead, both of his hands only moved slightly. This was the most commonly seen martial arts move. He faced the blade with empty hands.</p>

  <p>Ordinary warriors would be able to use this move if they were confident.</p>

  <p>But, in order to use this move, they had to know their own strength and grasp the exact direction of the sword. Gus also had to be extremely precise if he hoped to win. There could be no failure with this move, for failure meant death. If there was even the slightest unaccounted variable, his hands would be crippled.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Luo Zheng was already a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm and Gus had already witnessed the terrifying strength that Luo Luo Zheng had unleashed, but he still dared to fight empty-handed against Luo Zheng's sword! He was clearly supremely confident in his own strength.</p>

  <p>The blade of the five-foot-long sword pierced through Gus' palms with tremendous force. The sword stabbed straight into his palms, but its speed instantly slowed.</p>

  <p>One inch, five inches, nine inches, twelve inches?</p>

  <p>As the sword stabbed twelve inches into Gus' palms, it was forcibly caught within. As for the sword's tip, it finally stopped right in front of his chest with the tip gently pressing against the bare skin.</p>

  <p>Gus smiled. "With your cultivation at the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm, the power you can unleash is comparable to a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior. You are considered outstanding, but still far from enough in my eyes!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze froze slightly. Aside from the Supreme Lords, the world lords and the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors, Gus was indeed the strongest opponent he had ever met amongst his peers.</p>

  <p>In the Humanity Alliance, besides those Supreme Lord descendants, Layla had been considered his strongest opponent. However, Luo Luo Zheng was still able to leave her far behind with his power and skills. That being said, Gus' current cultivation was also at the early stage of the Soul Sea Realm, but he could snatch away Luo Zheng's sword with his bare hands.</p>

  <p>But the fight was unfair. Gus' true strength was hard to imagine. Even the Supreme Lords in the universe would not be able to compare to him.</p>

  <p>When he fought against Luo Luo Zheng, he had suppressed his strength to the same level as Luo Zheng's. But whether it was combat experience, or the difference in their understanding of raw strength and laws, Luo Luo Zheng was left feeling much inferior to Gus.</p>

  <p>"Cut the crap!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng suddenly drew his sword, and with a resounding slash, he stabbed it vehemently towards Gus.</p>

  <p>Gus chuckled as he followed suit and seized the blade with his bare hands again. He gripped Luo Zheng's Thunder Wind Divine Sword with both hands, and with a light rub between his left and right palms, the hilt suddenly spun rapidly from Luo Zheng's hands.</p>

  <p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Gus approached Luo Luo Zheng and his shoulder suddenly collided with him.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The collision had unexpectedly sent Luo Luo Zheng flying, while Gus also took a few steps back. An astonished expression once again appeared on Gus' face. "What a tough body!" Gus pinched his shoulder and let out a hissing sound. Then, with a light pinch, a crisp cracking sound was heard. The broken bone had been instantly reattached; such was Gus' power.</p>

  <p>Then, he threw the sword to stab into the ground in front of Luo Luo Zheng, causing the blade to wiggle endlessly. At the same time, he laughed and said,</p>

  <p>"What the hell is with your body? How could it be so strong?"</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't be bothered to talk to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had never suffered loss in a physical confrontation before, but he had just been sent flying by this warrior in their collision.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race warriors were indeed strong. 'I had originally thought that no one in the same realm could defeat me. However, Gus' cultivation is only at the Soul Sea Realm, yet he's actually able to suppress me in the aspect that I'm most adept at, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>Gus came to the same conclusion in his heart. The disciples that his master had accepted were indeed all extraordinary warriors.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't know, of course, that Gus had long since surpassed the heavens. He was a heaven-shaking figure and even beyond the heavens.</p>

  <p>Although he was impressed, he would not accept his fate. There was no such word in Luo Zheng's head as surrender.</p>

  <p>With a flip of his body, he pulled out his Thunder Wind Divine Sword and once again charged towards Gus.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The same move, the same method, the same result!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng fell to the ground once again, and the Thunder Wind Divine Sword again ended up quivering in the ground next to him.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng got up, Gus smiled and said, "Luo Luo Zheng, you should accept your fate. You aren't even 30 years old, while I have lived for several grand eras. If I really was to be defeated by you, then I would truly be an idiot.</p>

  <p>No! Even an idiot who has lived for several grand eras would be somebody..."</p>

  <p>He stopped midsentence.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Zheng's gaze suddenly turned incomparably cold. A faint sword intent was now attached to the Thunder Wind Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>The Gods-intimidating Strike was extremely powerful. When it was used by a Supreme Lord, it could even injure a True God.</p>

  <p>However, this was not the most terrifying part of the Gods-intimidating Strike. In the history of the universe, countless talents had created many miraculous martial skills, some of which were extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>Combined with the Laws of Causality of some Supreme Lords, they might not be weaker than the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>However, either the cost to use these heaven-defying martial skills was enormous, or the time needed to prepare was extremely long. Either way, it was not a swift battle tactic.</p>

  <p>When warriors fought each other, the long period of preparation for a martial skill was also a major flaw. It could not be used to fend off an immediate attack.</p>

  <p>However, the Gods-intimidating Strike was very special. It did not even require a brewing process, and it could be performed at will. That alone made it intimidating to not just the gods.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng entered the state of abandoning all of his emotions, his sword was suddenly thrust out.</p>

  <p>"Do you still dare to take it head on?"</p>

  <p>After he finished speaking, Luo Zheng's sword had already arrived in front of Gus.</p>

  <p>Gus had already seen that Luo Zheng's sword attack this time was extraordinary, but how could he willingly show his fear? He continued to extend his hands, intending to receive Luo Zheng's sword blow with the same force as before.</p>

  <p>The sword blade was again received by Gus.</p>

  <p>But at the same time that he caught Luo Zheng's sword, the powerful sword intent left the blade and continued to charge straight at him.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>This sword strike could cut through the heavens, destroy tens of thousands of laws, and even exterminate a True God. It was unstoppable.</p>

  <p>It was true that Luo Luo Zheng had displayed such terrifying power, as he had already comprehended 99% of this sword technique. How many people at the same level could contend against him?</p>
