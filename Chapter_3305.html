<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Never mind. I'm just glad you're okay," said Flamine softly, cradling her daughter in her arms.</p>

  <p>What was important was her daughter had finally come back safely.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge's eyelashes fluttered as she tried to keep her eyes open. Forcing a smile, she murmured, "It's not that simple."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Not understanding what Feng Ge meant, Flamine anxiously held Feng Ge's hands and looked her up and down carefully.</p>

  <p>Afraid that her daughter's soul had been hurt, she breathed a sigh of relief when she found that Feng Ge was perfectly fine.</p>

  <p>"I'm still in the Dark Region," Feng Ge replied.</p>

  <p>When the three old men heard her words, they exchanged worried glances.</p>

  <p>One of them cut in, "If you are still in the Dark Region, how did you leave?"</p>

  <p>There were special ways to enter the Dark Region. They were rarely ever used, but some masters in the Oneness Sky Palace, like Flamine, knew about them.</p>

  <p>Flamine's eyes widened in shock. She couldn't imagine how her daughter managed to escape from the Other Shore if she was in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge glanced apprehensively at the three old men. "Uncles, would you mind leaving me and my mother alone?"</p>

  <p>Even though the three men were from Phoenix Palace, there were some things Feng Ge only wanted to disclose to her mother.</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge, you have just returned from the Other Shore. Please rest well," one of them said meekly.</p>

  <p>"If you have any problem, you can approach me anytime," another one added.</p>

  <p>The third uncle nodded wordlessly.</p>

  <p>Once the three old men left, only Feng Ge and Flamine were left in the huge palace.</p>

  <p>Then, Feng Ge turned to her mother seriously and explained what happened in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Flamine had already heard of what happened in the Grand Sky Temple and the wooden hut. The disciples of the Phoenix Palace had already reported to her in detail. But she knew nothing about what happened after Dorothy, Chaim and the others left.</p>

  <p>"Has that corporeal body been protecting you the whole time you were in the Dark Region?" Flamine asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng's face flashed in Feng Ge's mind, albeit a bit vaguely. After all, she had only physically met Zheng twice in the Oneness Sky Palace, even though they had spent a long time on the Other Shore together.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge nodded. "Mother, do you know who the corporeal body is?"</p>

  <p>Flamine shook her head. Only a few people in the Oneness Sky Palace knew Zheng could enter the Other Shore with his corporeal body.</p>

  <p>"Who is he? Is he a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace?"</p>

  <p>After all, the mysterious man had helped the Oneness Sky Palace so often.</p>

  <p>It was very likely he was a disciple from there. But Flamine couldn't figure out who he was exactly.</p>

  <p>After a brief pause, Feng Ge whispered, "It's  Zheng Luo..."</p>

  <p>A flash of excitement lit up Flamine's beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>Although she had suspected this, she still felt a tinge of shock.</p>

  <p>The first time she had encountered Zheng, he had broken into the Phoenix Palace, which was no ordinary feat. He had even managed to suppress Feng Ge. Moreover, his Other Shore Token was of the strengthening type, which was nothing special!</p>

  <p>While there were many amazing disciples in the Oneness Sky Palace, in the eyes of Flamine, no one was her daughter's match, except Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her happy expression quickly shifted to one of worry. "Since you're back, has Zheng also returned?"</p>

  <p>"He should have," Feng Ge answered. "Mother, listen to me..."</p>

  <p>She then went on to tell Flamine about what they had seen in the Dark Region. When she mentioned the light column, Flamine raised her eyebrows curiously. Something seemed to cross her mind, but she didn't say it aloud.</p>

  <p>"Only after we entered the light column were we able to leave the Other Shore. If we return, we will still be trapped in there," Feng Ge said helplessly.</p>

  <p>It was similar to being trapped in the whirlpool in the Sea of Truth. If the Souls of Light were trapped somewhere on the Other Shore, it would be difficult to improve their cultivation in the future.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge also knew that asking for her mother's help was probably futile.</p>

  <p>It would be very difficult for Souls of Light in upper stages to enter lower stages. Even if they did manage to enter, they would still be in great danger in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>After a while, Flamine said cautiously, "I'm going to see Zheng."</p>

  <p>"I'll come with you," Feng Ge immediately answered.</p>

  <p>Flamine raised an eyebrow at her daughter in surprise. The Feng Ge she knew wouldn't have been so amicable.</p>

  <p>Of course, Feng Ge understood what was going on in her mother's mind. Her usual emotionless face turned bright red with embarrassment. "I just want to discuss with him how we will get out of this troublesome situation..."</p>

  <p>"That's what I thought, but why are you blushing?" Flamine said with a knowing smile.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge felt even more embarrassed. Pursing her lips, she tried to resume her usual cold expression.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yudie was busy thinking about the Other Shore. She had never been there before, so it was hard for her to imagine just how dangerous it was.</p>

  <p>Every time Dorothy returned, she would ask about the situation there.</p>

  <p>Dorothy understood her worries and had patiently answered her every time.</p>

  <p>The events that took place in the Grand Sky Temple had made an impact on the Ear Mice. They had no intention of opening the temple again in the near future, so these days, the thirteen stages on the Other Shore were quite peaceful.</p>

  <p>However, when Yudie asked Dorothy for news this time around, Dorothy shook her head in worry. "The candlelight is out," was the only thing she said.</p>

  <p>Standing at the entrance to the Grand Sky Temple, she could see the three wooden huts and a band of light leading to the huts. The band of light was the wooden bridge.</p>

  <p>Two hours ago, Dorothy stood at that very same spot to investigate. At the time, the band of light and the huts were nowhere to be seen.</p>

  <p>That could only mean one thing: the candlelight went out.</p>

  <p>Without the candlelight, both the Souls of Light and the corporeal bodies would be swallowed up by darkness. One could only imagine the consequences.</p>

  <p>Dorothy hurriedly withdrew from the Other Shore and rushed to find Yudie.</p>

  <p>The two of them both bolted to the second floor to check up on Zheng. To their relief, they found that he was still sitting there, breathing evenly.</p>

  <p>Although they did not know what had happened in the Dark Region, it was still good news that Zheng was still alive.</p>

  <p>This time, when Dorothy arrived, Margaret didn't taunt her.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been trapped for so long. She was getting more and more anxious.</p>

  <p>These days, she had been sitting in silence at the end of the corridor on the second floor, looking into the room from time to time, hoping that Zheng would wake up.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect the cultivation on the Other Shore would be so dangerous,"</p>

  <p>Yudie said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>In her mind, cultivation methods and theurgies might make one mad, but compared to the Other Shore, these were nothing!</p>

  <p>"Strictly speaking, entering the Other Shore isn't a kind of cultivation. It's simply an adventure," Dorothy explained. "Countless talents have died on the Other Shore since ancient times."</p>

  <p>Yudie shuddered at the word "die". With an indignant huff, she said, "My husband has good luck. I believe he will return safely."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a deep voice interrupted them. "Oh? How are you so confident in your husband?"</p>

  <p>The women turned to look. To their surprise and delight, Zheng smiled at them from where he sat.</p>
