  <p>
</p>

  <p>All of the Eternal Realm warriors present were always on guard. They frequently released their spiritual senses to monitor their surroundings.</p>

  <p>Among all of them, the Wing King had the sharpest senses. Whether it was a mosquito or a fly, he immediately noticed everything.</p>

  <p>However, the two big-headed monsters quietly appeared and abducted the two men in black robes. It was very odd!</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>"Help me..."</p>

  <p>One of the men in black robes named Brock was still conscious and cried faintly for help. Moreover, the sound of his bones being chewed also alerted everyone's ears in the immensely quiet environment.</p>

  <p>The other men in black robes could not take it, so they tried to attack the big-headed monster to save Brock.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" the leader of the men in black robes shouted.</p>

  <p>"But Brock..." one man in black robes said anxiously.</p>

  <p>Brock was his best friend.</p>

  <p>How could he watch the monster chew him bit by bit?</p>

  <p>"I've made myself clear. Don't go there," the leader of the black-robed men said firmly.</p>

  <p>He was the leader of the Night Being race, and he cared about all of his race's members. The monster not far away was devouring one of his members, but he did not go there to save him. However, it wasn't because he didn't want to, but more of he couldn't.</p>

  <p>The other men in black robes fell silent.</p>

  <p>Even though their faces weren't that visible due to their thick robes, the others felt their helplessness.</p>

  <p>"What are these monsters?" Pearson asked in a low voice. His hands had already turned into thin spider threads, ready to fight at any time. At best, the Eternal Realm Hunters had only gone to the Supreme Pure Realm to explore. They didn't know much about the Treacherous Beings or the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>"They are Treacherous Beings, too. They are hostility-level Treacherous Beings, and they belong to the killing type," the leader of the men in black robes answered.</p>

  <p>"Killing type... What do you mean?" Pearson asked again.</p>

  <p>"Most Treacherous Beings have their own goals. Take the one that possessed Luo Zheng, for example. When something blocked it from its goals, that's the only time it attacked. But the killing type of Treacherous beings are different. Their goal is to kill, so we have to leave!" the leader of the men in black robes explained in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Then let's go!"</p>

  <p>Pearson agreed.</p>

  <p>Then, the three Eternal Realm Hunters quickly walked towards the door.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Snake Goddess looked at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng still looked like he had regained his consciousness as he calmly gazed at the crowd.</p>

  <p>Earlier, the Treacherous Being had howled in an attempt to warn them to leave. It was clear that it was out of kindness.</p>

  <p>With such a kind gesture? It was unlikely that it would hurt Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Take care," said the Snake Goddess, even though it was unknown if Luo Zheng had heard her or not. Then, she turned around and left quickly with Fuxi and the other Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>The two monsters were still about ten feet away from the crowd. They squatted on the ground and slowly chewed the two men in black robes.</p>

  <p>They did not intend to attack the others, but they just stared at the crowd with their large, grotesque eyes.</p>

  <p>As the warriors passed by them, a chill ran down their spines, and their hairs stood on end.</p>

  <p>Aside from the unpleasant feeling that the Treacherous Beings caused them, they also felt a hint of cruelty, a killing aura that made them feel as if all life forms were nothing but garbage to them.</p>

  <p>No one looked at the big-headed monsters as they passed by. Instead, they stared at the door. It should be safe after they entered the door.</p>

  <p>Just as they were four miles away from the door, however, a dozen large heads popped out from the edge of the round tray!</p>

  <p>It appeared as if these big-headed monsters had reached a mutual agreement. At that moment, they crawled up from the edge of the round tray and gathered in the middle.</p>

  <p>"So many of them! Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!" King Ieuan exclaimed with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>"Charge!" Eastern Emperor Taiyi commanded in a deep voice.</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate that they couldn't even deal with an ordinary Treacherous Being. There were more than ten of them in this place, and according to the leader of the men in black robes, the killing type were far more dangerous than the ordinary ones.</p>

  <p>What they didn't know was that at the bottom of the round tray, a large black head hung upside down.</p>

  <p>The pitch-black head was over ten thousand feet high, and its eyes were closed. It should be asleep.</p>

  <p>Around its neck were big-headed monsters that clung to each other, which made them look like a bunch of grapes.</p>

  <p>Those big-headed monsters kept falling off the black head's neck. After they fell, they climbed from the bottom of the round tray up to the top of it.</p>

  <p>At that point, everyone had a bad feeling and sped up.</p>

  <p>The monsters looked stupidly ridiculous. They had big heads but small bodies, which gave the impression that they moved slowly.</p>

  <p>However, they were surprisingly fast.</p>

  <p>The men in black robes who were in front dashed and left a series of shadows in their wake.</p>

  <p>With such a speed, they could enter the door in the blink of an eye. By the time they were a little more than a hundred feet away from the door, the big-headed monsters suddenly turned into black shadows and silently flew over.</p>

  <p>"Dodge!" the leader of the men in black robes shouted.</p>

  <p>Sadly, it was too late.</p>

  <p>Although the people behind stopped, they could not see clearly how the monsters attacked.</p>

  <p>As a result, four men in black robes who were still running disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>When everyone snapped back to their senses, four monsters nearby had already stopped and slowly devoured the men in black robes. Copious amounts of blood gushed from their mouths, accompanied by the pained howls of the men in black robes.</p>

  <p>The big-headed monsters that were farther away still crawled slowly towards them.</p>

  <p>These big-headed monsters had quite strange habits. They were never in a hurry to attack. If one ran away, they only stared at them with their black eyes.</p>

  <p>"Chief, what should we do?" a man in black robes whimpered.</p>

  <p>The Night Being race did have some experience in dealing with Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>This race's unique abilities only worked in the Dark Region. Even if their opponents were the powerful Treacherous Beings, they could still fight against them in the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>Outside the Dark Region, however, they were far inferior to even the ordinary Eternal Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>"Go back," Pearson suddenly said.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi countered, "I'm afraid if we retreat, we won't have a chance to survive. We can only go all out and charge. Everyone..." As he spoke, Pearson pointed at the door not far away. dozens of big-headed monsters climbed up from the edge of the round tray, and slowly approached the door.</p>

  <p>If they forcefully rushed towards them, they would all die.</p>

  <p>"Retreat," said Fuxi.</p>

  <p>No one had expected that they would face such a crisis in a short time.</p>

  <p>This place was much more dangerous than the Whining Road!</p>

  <p>"These big-headed monsters are really odd. Don't move too fast. Retreat slowly!" the Snake Goddess strongly reminded.</p>

  <p>"So what if we retreat? We will still die!" a man in black robes shouted hysterically.</p>

  <p>"Odin! Shut up!" the leader hissed.</p>

  <p>"It's all your fault. You brought us into this desperate situation! If you want to retreat, you can retreat by yourselves. I'm sorry, but I won't follow you!"</p>

  <p>Afterward, the man in black robes named Odin brought out a yellow stone and crushed it. A ball of yellow light burst out from the stone and quickly pooled around his legs.</p>

  <p>It was the Divine Walking Stone, which could greatly increase one's speed in a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Then, he turned into a beam of light and rushed towards the door.</p>

  <p>Even if his speed had increased by more than three times, seven big-headed monsters surrounded him even faster as he dashed towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The seven monsters formed a circle, then chewing sounds filled the air.</p>

  <p>Then, they immediately divided Odin among themselves.</p>
