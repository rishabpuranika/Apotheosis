<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The tracking array in the Trumpet Flying Ship has been destroyed. As long as you place divine crystals in it, you can drive it freely," said Ramzi as he jumped out of the flying ship.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at the flying ship and turned to look at Lorena and Mike, who were standing some distance away.</p>

  <p>Lorena's eyelids trembled as she rushed up and held Luo Zheng in her arms, her face full of reluctance.</p>

  <p>"No matter what happens, you must come back alive. This is my only request for you," whispered Lorena.</p>

  <p>Although she had been with Luo Zheng for a short period of time, he was her son, after all. Moreover, she had a very clear idea of what awaited Luo Zheng if he went to the Source World. It was impossible for her not to be worried about him.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, she believed her father and his arrangement for her son.</p>

  <p>She was certain that Chiyou would never send Luo Zheng on a suicide mission.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gently held Lorena in his arms and looked up into his father's eyes.</p>

  <p>Mike nodded to him in response, his eyes saying what his lips were not.</p>

  <p>At the moment of parting, the father and the son needed no more communication with each other.</p>

  <p>Lorena then said goodbye to Yan and gave her words of consolation and advice.</p>

  <p>Emily led the other members of the Snake Goddess race and boarded the Trumpet Flying Ship. Leopold was the only one among the Nine Li Guards who decided to join the trip.</p>

  <p>Chiyou hadn't given any further instructions to the Nine Li Guards; he only told them to escort Yan to the Li Shan mountain. This task could be accomplished by Emily, who hailed from the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng's mission, No. 9527 was not very forthcoming regarding the details.</p>

  <p>Therefore, most of the Nine Li Guards, including Timotheus, elected to stay in the divine land. As far as the Nine Li Guards were concerned, the divine land was the last pure land for the Nine Li race, and they were more willing to stay with their princess and protect her.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng boarded the ship, Leopold went to the stern of the Trumpet Flying Ship.</p>

  <p>There was a jade plate embedded in the ground at the stern.</p>

  <p>As Leopold reached out and pressed the jade plate gently, it slowly floated from its position and levitated in the air. Then, he took out a divine crystal and placed it on the floating jade plate.</p>

  <p>This jade plate, which was snatched from Godfrey, was a powerful object. It could be used to drive the Trumpet Flying Ship and also served as the array plate for the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. These days, Ramzi had spent much time on the jade plate and learned how to utilize the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. Then, he passed on this method to Leopold.</p>

  <p>Although the chaos was uninhabited, they had predicted some unanticipated troubles. With the help of the Slaughtering Moonlight Array, they would have certain assurance to be able to handle potential enemies.</p>

  <p>Under Leopold's control, the whole Trumpet Flying Ship slowly lifted from the ground. The ship accelerated through the air, and the Floating Islands below grew progressively smaller in their sight.</p>

  <p>Only a few people knew of Luo Zheng's departure from the divine land.</p>

  <p>The divine land needed absolute peace after experiencing the unimaginable chaos caused by Samuel and the Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>To this end, Luo Zheng had completely revised the laws on the Ruling Slate.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Timotheus, Ramzi, and the remaining Other Shore Realm masters were tasked to guard the area. None of the clans would dare to mess things around.</p>

  <p>Soon, the Trumpet Flying Ship reached the top of the divine land. As Luo Zheng controlled it with his mind, the space barrier enveloping the divine land disappeared.</p>

  <p>Leopold fiddled with the jade plate with both hands. Traces of the Space Law power were scattered on the surface of the entire flying ship. In the next moment, the ship entered a space channel and began to travel through the chaos.</p>

  <p>Whether in the chaos or in the divine land, the scenery inside the space channel was all the same.</p>

  <p>As the flying ship advanced smoothly, everyone soon calmed down from their parting emotions.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, did Chiyou not tell you where you should go?" Emily asked, eyes blinking with confusion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng only shrugged. That question was particularly difficult to answer.</p>

  <p>He knew that Chiyou must have discussed his next move with No. 9527, but that was related to the secrets between the Chaos Ancient God and his grandfather. Luo Zheng did not know what deal they had made; even if he did know, it was improper for him to disclose such a significant matter to Emily.</p>

  <p>"The Li Shan mountain is a good choice for you," Emily advised earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Although you're not a member of the Snake Goddess race, the Li Shan mountain doesn't exclude members of other races. If you come with us, I'll help you get all the resources that you need."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled gently and replied, "If I wanted a stable and peaceful life, staying in the divine land would probably have been the best choice for me."</p>

  <p>Emily's lips slightly twitched at their corners when she heard this statement.</p>

  <p>Originally, her intent was to warn Luo Zheng that the Source World was not as simple as the divine land. However, the thought of Luo Zheng's purpose of going to the Source World occurred to her, and she fell silent.</p>

  <p>As a descendant of the Nine Li race, which used to be a large, well-known race in the Source World, could Luo Zheng reconcile himself to the fact that their race had been completely decimated by Xuanyuan? In Emily's eyes, it was nearly impossible for the Nine Li race to regain their former glory because even Chiyou had been killed. She thought that Luo Zheng would fail to make any waves upon his arrival in the Source World.</p>

  <p>However, Emily was an outsider. After all, she could not meddle in this internal affair of the Nine Li race, and could only voice out her suggestions.</p>

  <p>Yan stood to their side, listening to their conversation quietly. She and Emily shared the same thought. How good it would have been if her brother would go to the Li Shan mountain together with them. They could take care of each other that way. However, she found herself biting back her worries when she heard her brother's answer.</p>

  <p>The journey in the chaos was extremely boring. According to Emily, it would take them several years to arrive in the Source World even with the incredible speed of the Trumpet Flying Ship.</p>

  <p>Before long, the members of the Snake Goddess race all leaned their backs against the wall of the flying ship, sitting cross-legged as they concentrated on cultivation.</p>

  <p>Leopold, on the other hand, focused solely on driving the Trumpet Flying Ship to prevent all kinds of emergencies.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng also selected a corner for himself and sat down cross-legged. With a thought in his mind, he created an avatar in his inner world.</p>

  <p>A floating island floated in the sky above Luo Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>The floating island was built in the shape of a gourd. Luo Zheng built an identical Cloud Hall at front and a duplicate Immortal Mansion behind it.</p>

  <p>The Immortal Mansion in the Swirl Forest had not been rebuilt after it was destroyed. After all, it was Bromley's masterpiece; even if Augustus had intended to restore it, it would not have been an easy feat. However, even with the Immortal Mansion gone, Saul had been taken away beforehand by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At present, he was staying in the duplicate Immortal Mansion with Yudie and the others.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng appeared in his inner world, he raised his eyebrows, and his figure suddenly vanished. In the next moment, he manifested in front of the floating island.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Liusu and Nelly stood at the door of the Cloud Hall, surprise evident in their eyes as they beheld a middle-aged man not far away from them.</p>

  <p>After the floating island was built, it was soon discovered by the creatures in the inner world.</p>

  <p>Some warriors with high levels of cultivation flew to a certain height and observed the floating island built by their creator some time ago, but none of them dared to approach it.</p>

  <p>However, this middle-aged man was different. He had directly set foot on the floating island and knelt down in front of the main entrance of the Cloud Hall on one knee.</p>

  <p>Curious, Nelly approached the man and asked him why he knelt here.</p>

  <p>However, the middle-aged man refused to answer, only telling her that he was waiting for someone.</p>

  <p>As for who he was waiting for, the middle-aged man would not answer her anyway.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's avatar appeared, Liusu greeted him excitedly and said,</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you've finally come! This man has been kneeling here, waiting for you for months."</p>
