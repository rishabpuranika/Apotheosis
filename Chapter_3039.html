<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The young man in black considered these disciples who came from nowhere as pariahs that didn't deserve his attention.</p>

  <p>Elgin's retort surprised the young man in black a little. He sneered, "Don't you know the rules, you bastard? You're courting death!"</p>

  <p>The young man in black raised his hand and struck out his palm towards Elgin.</p>

  <p>A trace of cold energy was hidden in his palm. Elgin would probably turn into an ice sculpture and fall into a pile of bloody pieces if he was hit. The man actually wanted to kill Elgin.</p>

  <p>Elgin, who was new here, felt confused about the situation.</p>

  <p>Even in the Sword Light Palace, no one dared to attack without a warning, but this man in black meant to kill when he attacked without giving any warning or signs.</p>

  <p>Out of desperation, Elgin suddenly twisted his body and instinctively held up the cyan sword that was still sheathed in front of him to block the attack.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>When the young man's palm hit it, a wave of cold energy spread out.</p>

  <p>Elgin suddenly felt a cool sensation in his right hand, and half of his body was frozen within seconds!</p>

  <p>The young man in black had no intentions of stopping at that. After the first slap, he flipped his hand and tried to slap Elgin's head again. He was determined to kill Elgin on the spot.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his eyebrows and leaped towards Elgin like a panther. He grabbed Elgin's clothes and pulled him backwards. Elgin narrowly missed this slap. At the same time, he said to the man in black, "If you have any issues with him, we can talk. Why are you hell bent on killing him?"</p>

  <p>The young man in black stared at Zheng coldly and laughed. "Who do you think you are? A waste of a warrior with poor strength! What makes you think you have the right to ask me to speak nicely to you?"</p>

  <p>As streams of Truth of Godly Way accumulated around him, countless palm prints covered Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>A fierce light flashed in Zheng's eyes. He didn't dodge the palm prints and instead rushed straight towards the young man in black.</p>

  <p>Slam! Slam! Slam!</p>

  <p>Several palm prints hit Zheng's body, forming layers of icy shells on the surface of his body. But when his body shook slightly, the icy shells broke.</p>

  <p>He was not affected at all.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, Zheng rushed to the young man in black and extended his right hand like a bolt of lightning.</p>

  <p>The young man in black didn't expect Zheng to be such a ferocious opponent.</p>

  <p>He was taken aback momentarily. The double swords on his back suddenly unsheathed and flew towards Zheng as he yelled, "Sword Freezing Momentum!"</p>

  <p>This killing tactic was a result of the fusion of Mysterious Ice Godly Way and the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent. Whatever the sword touched would be rendered frozen and then crumble to pieces.</p>

  <p>Noticing that Zheng still had no intentions of dodging his attack, the young man in black smiled smugly.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's counter strike was beyond his imagination. He spread out his arms, which were like two poisonous snakes that came at their prey. He grabbed the two swords from the young man, and then released a great force.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Zheng actually broke the swords.</p>

  <p>Before the man in black could react, Zheng's palm had landed on his chest.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The young man in black was thrown backwards with the impact and he heavily fell on the ground.</p>

  <p>He was dizzy and struggled to raise his head. He said angrily, "Do you know who I am? You will definitely pay for offending me. Prepare to die!"</p>

  <p>"Oh really? I will die?" Zheng touched his nose and chortled as if he had heard the funniest joke in the world.</p>

  <p>When the young man in black opened his mouth to speak again, Zheng sent a strong wind to him with a casual wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>An invisible force went straight into the man's mouth. His teeth were smashed into pieces and blood flowed out of his mouth.</p>

  <p>"So, I'm a waste of a warrior with poor strength who has no right to ask you to speak nicely to me, huh?" Zheng said as he stood towering over the young man in black and looking down at him.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>More than twenty people led by the young man in black drew their swords in preparation for an all-out assault.</p>

  <p>They were all from the same clan. Intense power of the Truths of Godly Ways spread out along with a cold energy, immediately turning the surroundings into a winter land.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>One of them stood between Zheng and the young man in black and announced, "He is the young master of our Wang Clan. If anything happened to him, you would be dead for sure. If you know when to stop and kneel down to beg for mercy, maybe our Wang Clan can spare your life..."</p>

  <p>Thwack!</p>

  <p>Before the man could finish his words, Zheng slapped him hard.</p>

  <p>The slap seemed to be weak, but it was in fact powerful and extremely quick. Zheng's opponent was unable to dodge it. His body spun in the air several times before falling to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Even the waste knocked down by me didn't have the qualifications to talk to me. Those who think they are not a waste can come forward and try,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said intimidatingly.</p>

  <p>The people of the Wang Clan couldn't see clearly how Zheng made his move.</p>

  <p>Although they drew their swords at the same time and were ready to attack, there was a hint of fear in their eyes, especially the young master of the Wang Clan, who had now got up with the help of others. He was glaring at Zheng as if he was going to devour him in one gulp.</p>

  <p>But just as he had said earlier himself, these worthless people with poor strength could do nothing to defend themselves.</p>

  <p>Just then, a few white figures suddenly appeared atop the tall Sword Wall.</p>

  <p>These figures were all dressed in white robes and had swords on their backs. They all dashed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the young master of the Wang Clan saw these white figures, his eyes lit up as if his savior had arrived. He shouted in a muffled voice, "Jagger!</p>

  <p>I'm here!"</p>

  <p>The young men in the white robes emitted a powerful aura. Although they were not at the Other Shore Realm, the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent emitted from them was full, indicating that they were only one step away from reaching the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>As soon as these people appeared, the place, which had been noisy, fell silent.</p>

  <p>The young man at the helm flew down and scolded impatiently, "Anyone who dares to make trouble under the wall will be killed immediately!"</p>

  <p>Carlisle Wang moaned, "Jagger! He wanted to kill me just now!"</p>

  <p>The young man who spoke was Jagger Wang, two years older than his younger brother, Carlisle Wang, and he had already crossed the Sword Wall before his younger brother.</p>

  <p>After inspecting Carlisle Wang's injury, Jagger Wang turned to look at Zheng and asked, "You wanted to kill my brother?"</p>

  <p>"No," Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>Jagger Wang was a little surprised to hear this. He sneered, "You dared to do it but are chickening out when it comes to facing the consequences of your actions? Do you think you will get away just by denying what you did?"</p>

  <p>However, Zheng continued, "I have spoken the truth. If I really wanted to kill him, he would have already become a corpse by now. Moreover, such a useless person doesn't deserve to be killed by me!"</p>

  <p>A malicious look took over Jagger Wang's face. He sneered, "Interesting!</p>

  <p>There are very few pariahs who are so ignorant about everything under the Sword Wall."</p>

  <p>Zheng remained calm and said coldly, "I also find it interesting. It's rare to see so many good-for-nothings pop out one after another!"</p>

  <p>The faces of the young men in white robes darkened at this. The young man standing at the end of the queue didn't think it was a big deal and instead laughed and remarked, "Jagger, a mere pariah dared to call you a good-for-nothing. Hahaha!"</p>
