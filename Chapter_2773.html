<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone was taken aback by what was happening before their eyes.</p>

  <p>Having lived for countless years, the Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings present were particularly sensitive to the intensity of the energy that Gallio had released.</p>

  <p>The energy waves caused by the explosion of the magic crystal were terrifying.</p>

  <p>Even a dozen or so Holy Beings would not be able to stop the energy waves, let alone just one of them.</p>

  <p>In terms of strength, these fiends were indeed way superior to the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas still managed to singlehandedly block off the energy waves, once again showing his real strength to the other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Samuel returned to the Desperation Plain with Pascal.</p>

  <p>He had already been wearing a long face the whole way back as he knew that letting Zheng go would pose a threat to him in the future, but his face became even more sullen when he saw the amount of power Nicholas had.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Nicholas could not completely destroy the energy waves; he was only holding them off for the time being.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the walls of the invisible dam began to collapse.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the others had retreated to a safe place by this time.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>The energy waves finally burst forth and spread out, devouring everything along the road. Even the death auras that haunted the Desperation Plain all day long, along with the faint whines, had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Nicholas' face remained calm as usual, as if killing one of the great fiends hadn't satisfied him at all.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Clark put out the flames on his body and resumed his normal form. His original ruddy face had turned very pale, and he couldn't help but cough. He quickly took out a red pill from the Sumeru Space and put it into his mouth.</p>

  <p>Although Nicholas was the one who had defeated Gallio, Clark and Murphy had also played a key role in their fight.</p>

  <p>Gallio's power was much higher than a Holy Being's, so even Nicholas would not have been able to fight against him head-on alone.</p>

  <p>Clark and Murphy had made a concerted effort to force Gallio to an impasse.</p>

  <p>Nicholas conveyed an order and soon, the other Holy Beings, Demi-holy Beings, and consummate True Gods all gathered around.</p>

  <p>Staring at them, Nicholas took out a pale green jade token. The center of the jade token was broken. With a flicker of his eyes, he said, "Jayden is dead."</p>

  <p>Clark was shocked to hear these words. He quickly stretched out his hand and conjured up a flame-shaped token. The life symbol of Raymond, the Demi-holy Being of the Tang Clan, was attached to the flame-shaped token.</p>

  <p>Now, the light of the flame-shaped token had completely disappeared, which meant that Raymond was dead as well.</p>

  <p>"Mathew has also been killed," Murphy chipped in dejectedly.</p>

  <p>Their clansmen's hearts broke into pieces. These three Demi-holy Beings had been indispensable for the rich clans.</p>

  <p>The three of them together would have been more than enough to defeat Zheng, but now, unexpectedly, all of them had been killed.</p>

  <p>"Let's avenge them later. Right now, we have to move on to the next stage," said Nicholas, holding back his sadness.</p>

  <p>He always dealt with problems in order of importance and urgency.</p>

  <p>Sure, killing Zheng was important, but in his eyes, the main purpose of this trip was to take control of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>They had killed so many fiends just now, so what they needed to do next was to take advantage of the victory and chase after other fiends. Zheng's matter could be put aside for the time being.</p>

  <p>Under Nicholas' lead, the team headed toward the depths of the Desperation Plain again.</p>

  <p>"Father, are you okay?"</p>

  <p>Rachelle asked with concern as she looked at Murphy's pale and tired face.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm fine."</p>

  <p>Murphy was sitting cross-legged in the air. A faint green color glowed on the surface of his body, and his weakened breath rapidly grew stronger.</p>

  <p>The battle on the Desperation Plain had gone far more smoothly than everyone had imagined.</p>

  <p>"The fiends are just so-so."</p>

  <p>"The fiend that was killed by Holy Nicholas should have been the most powerful one, right?"</p>

  <p>"If that's all they are capable of, it seems that things will be much easier than we imagined."</p>

  <p>Some of the consummate True Gods breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Back when they were in the third stage of the Abyss Demon Region, the consummate True Gods, as well as some of the Demi-holy Beings, had been apprehensive.</p>

  <p>After all, they had just stepped into the Abyss Demon Region, but just a few weak fiends had beaten them black and blue.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, however, fighting with the strongest fiend had been easier than they had thought.</p>

  <p>"Don't you all see that something is wrong?" asked one of the Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"There were a lot of fiends on the Desperation Plain," said the Demi-holy Being. "If you were the leader of the fiends, would you have sent so many of your soldiers to battle at once?"</p>

  <p>The fiends were an elite race and they didn't have many members.</p>

  <p>However, many of them had been dispatched today to fight on the Desperation Plain.</p>

  <p>Besides, if the fiends had really chosen to fight the union of the wealthy clans, they would have dispatched more of their great fiends instead of letting Gallio go alone.</p>

  <p>If several of the stronger fiends had appeared here at the same time, the situation would not have been this simple to deal with.</p>

  <p>Of course, Nicholas and the other Holy Beings had also thought of this.</p>

  <p>They whispered among themselves as they led the way forward.</p>

  <p>"A strong fiend led the team. Don't you think it is too weird? The fiends had no reason to do this. Are they having an internal conflict?" said Jeremiah, frowning.</p>

  <p>"It's quite possible. Otherwise, why would the fiends send such a great gift to us?" Clark echoed in agreement.</p>

  <p>If the fiends were really stupid enough to let the union of the wealthy clans defeat them little by little without fighting back, it would obviously be a good thing for the union.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas shook his head and said, "That's impossible."</p>

  <p>"These fiends have gathered all the negative Faith Energies. It's normal for them to fight amongst themselves. Why is it impossible?" Murphy asked.</p>

  <p>Nicholas squinted as he stared straight ahead. "Gallio died too calmly."</p>

  <p>"The fiends are immortal. They will be reborn after death," refuted Clark.</p>

  <p>Death was an ordinary thing for the beasts in the forbidden lands.</p>

  <p>"It's not that. Gallio seemed to have foreseen his own death. If the fiends are having an internal conflict like Jeremiah said, it was unnecessary and dangerous for Gallio to take us on alone. Instead, he could have gained an advantage over the other fiends by joining hands with us," said Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"Sounds reasonable," Samuel interrupted as he caught up with the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings' faces turned slightly cold when they saw Samuel.</p>

  <p>"Let's put this aside first. Samuel, you went to personally chase after Zheng. I wonder what you've found," Nicholas said, looking straight at Samuel.</p>

  <p>Samuel had sent Liusu and her siblings to chase after Zheng and then found an excuse to join them, directly going against Nicholas' order. Now, Nicholas was criticizing him for what he had done.</p>
