  <p>
</p>

  <p>The golden light of the four Taming Dragon Arhats had been annihilated by the starlight.</p>

  <p>But with the interference of the giant golden Buddha, the light within their bodies grew even more resplendent. The stone statues that had been shattered previously merged together within seconds, returning to their original states.</p>

  <p>The starlight that dispersed throughout the adytum dimmed gradually.</p>

  <p>Zheng's figure emerged from the shadows. When he looked at the four unharmed Taming Dragon Arhats, his face revealed a look of surprise and the expression on his face turned cold.</p>

  <p>He was stunned at how strong the four statues of the Taming Dragon Arhats were.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Luo Zheng had used the Multiple Stars Brilliance, but he had no doubt about its enormous destructive power. It was the most explosive move in the Stellar Body.</p>

  <p>Such a strong attack was still unable to defeat the four Taming Dragon Arhats. What happened confused Luo Zheng. He had not predicted this.</p>

  <p>He had encountered all eighteen types of arhats in succession in the adytums. The strength of the arhats increased ever so slightly as he passed through the adytums one by one, but that difference was not very noteworthy.</p>

  <p>The Taming Dragon Arhats resided in the last adytum. It was not a surprise that they were stronger.</p>

  <p>So far, Zheng's methods had failed to destroy the four arhats. This meant trouble for him.</p>

  <p>What he did not know was that the arhats had returned to their original state only because someone had intervened in secret.</p>

  <p>The four Taming Dragon Arhats did not stop moving as the dragon scales of the Genuine Dragons on their shoulders quivered and shone.</p>

  <p>Once again they charged toward Luo Zheng from four different directions.</p>

  <p>If it had been any other martial artist facing the arhats, he would have perhaps lost all hope in such a situation.</p>

  <p>However, to Luo Zheng, the trouble before him was just a trouble that he had to tackle.</p>

  <p>Facing the four arhats coming at him, Zheng's face was inscrutable. Once again, he raised the Thunder Wind Divine Sword high in the air. The long and narrow sword had been hanging at his side. A faint sword intent lingered around the sword blade, curled like a venomous snake. It then spread forward in the air.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze was cold as he looked at the arhats. It was as if he had become an expressionless statue at this moment.</p>

  <p>Just as he raised the Thunder Wind Divine Sword, something flickered in the eyes of the giant Buddha who was residing in the depths of the ancient temple.</p>

  <p>"As I expected, the boy cultivates the Emotion Closing Godly Way...</p>

  <p>Although his cultivation is not yet complete, he has reached his limits for he has comprehended this cold and cruel sword intent at his Soul Sea Realm cultivation. If he can finish the last bit of the Emotion Closing Godly Way and comprehend the ultimate sword intent, then this sword attack will be complete!"</p>

  <p>As the words of the giant golden Buddha lingered in the air, he raised the lotus in his hand. It started to spin in front of him.</p>

  <p>On the branch of the lotus flower was a fork, and on the top of the fork was a seedpod of lotus, growing side by side with the flower.</p>

  <p>The golden Buddha stretched his giant hand toward the seedpod and fished out a golden lotus seed from within.</p>

  <p>"If I were to say it, all methods are an outcome of fate. The heart from the past cannot be obtained, the heart from the present cannot be possessed, the heart from the future cannot be reaped..."</p>

  <p>As the golden giant Buddha chanted this mantra, the lotus seed seemed to melt into a drop of pure golden liquid that revolved in front of him.</p>

  <p>As the drop of golden liquid continued to roll, it began to take shape. A body with four limbs and a head...</p>

  <p>Eventually, the seed transformed into a little person whose physique was very similar to Zheng's.</p>

  <p>The golden giant Buddha had used the 'Fate Sutra' to look into Zheng's fate.</p>

  <p>Such a calculation technique was a great theurgy. In comparison, the calculations of the other Supreme Lords were just child's play.</p>

  <p>However, halfway through his prediction, his enormous eyes widened even more. He was visibly surprised and a trace of displeasure could be seen on his face.</p>

  <p>After a long while, the giant golden Buddha finally opened his mouth.</p>

  <p>"He is a man without destiny. How could there be a man without destiny�"</p>

  <p>His prediction was halted.</p>

  <p>The golden lotus seed took the form of Luo Zheng. Its face should have been perfectly recognizable, having borrowed Zheng's. However, at the moment, the face of the little golden figure seemed to be shrouded in a layer of mist. It was unable to take up a clear outline.</p>

  <p>"Blast it! I want to see how long you can last!"</p>

  <p>While the golden Buddha was carrying out his prediction, Luo Zheng made his move.</p>

  <p>He launched the Gods-intimidating Strike. It was invincible.</p>

  <p>The power unleashed by the four Taming Dragon Arhats was indeed impressive, but they could not stop the strike's onslaught.</p>

  <p>As this chilling attack began, a thin line appeared around the waists of the four arhats who had been charging straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Four muffled sounds resounded right after.</p>

  <p>Each of the four arhats was hacked into two pieces by Luo Zheng. Their heads and bodies collapsed to the ground separately.</p>

  <p>Golden light escaped from the wounds that Luo Zheng had cut open. As it flickered, a strange power was triggered from within the statues. Once again, the separated parts of their bodies bonded together.</p>

  <p>This miraculous ability was comparable to that of an indestructible body.</p>

  <p>No matter how Luo Zheng slashed them, the four Taming Dragon Arhats were always able to recover.</p>

  <p>Encountering this wondrous situation, Zheng's eyes were cold, but his emotions were not moved in the slightest.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Zheng's heart was as chilly as ice and snow. He no longer had any thoughts, only a calm and murderous intention in his heart. He would not rest until he had killed the four Taming Dragon Arhats.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>A few more muffled sounds were heard.</p>

  <p>Before the four arhats could get up, Luo Zheng wielded his sword once again.</p>

  <p>The sword light held a cruel sword intent that unfurled into a fan-like shape as it once again slashed at the bodies of the Taming Dragon Arhats.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>Before the arhats could recover their bodies, Luo Zheng hacked with his sword once again.</p>

  <p>"One strike..."</p>

  <p>"Two strikes..."</p>

  <p>"Three strikes..."</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng struck again and again, the fan-shaped sword light rolled out even more.</p>

  <p>Initially, he cut the Taming Dragon Arhats into two pieces, then four pieces, then eight� Finally, they were sliced into a pile of rubble.</p>

  <p>If someone were to walk in on this scene, they would be unable to identify this pile of rubble. Luo Zheng had chopped the Genuine Dragon statues into smithereens as well.</p>

  <p>However, the cross-sections of these jagged rocks still shone with specks of golden light. Each stone quivered and shook. The next instant, they attracted each other like magnets, sticking together to restore the original Taming Dragon Arhats.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng did not give them any respite.</p>

  <p>He did not stop hacking at them. He showed no mercy whatsoever.</p>

  <p>After employing the Emotion Closing Godly Way, Zheng's mind always underwent a drastic change. Unless he left this state of emotion closing voluntarily, the four arhats would never recover again. Otherwise, it would be impossible for Luo Zheng to stop.</p>

  <p>The golden light on the cross sections of the stones grew dimmer and dimmer as Zheng's sword slashed down at them.</p>

  <p>The light was abnormally forceful. It could heal the wounds of the arhats right away.</p>

  <p>The golden light, in fact, was a power that came from the Buddhist scripture, 'Past Solemn Kalpa'!</p>

  <p>Buddha's heart held onto the past. Therefore, after going through the tribulation of life and death, it was restored to its original state.</p>

  <p>The golden light was what caused the statues of the Taming Dragon Arhats to return to the state they had been in before being hacked to pieces.</p>

  <p>However, the stone statue was still just a statue, after all. The golden light was not infinite. As Luo Zheng attacked it repeatedly, the golden light seemed to lose its vigor.</p>

  <p>"If you still wish to recover, I will turn you all into dust!"</p>

  <p>Zheng's emotionless voice rang in the air as he brandished the Thunder Wind Divine Sword in his hand, breaking the rocks to even smaller pieces!</p>

  <p>As the light flickered and grew weak, Luo Zheng knew that this battle was about to come to an end.</p>

  <p>Just as this hope emerged in him, the golden light in the rubble suddenly brightened. It was now ten times more luminous than the light from before.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the broken pieces of stones vibrated strenuously, as if about to stick together once again.</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng realized that something was wrong.</p>

  <p>The golden light had clearly gone pale moments before. How did it get so brilliant all of a sudden?</p>

  <p>The sword in his hand did not stop. Luo Zheng looked ahead into the depths of this ancient temple and sensed that something was amiss. Had someone intervened in the fight just now?</p>

  <p>A thought rose in the mind of the golden giant Buddha. His Buddhist heart had already reached the Mahayana stage. However, as he saw Luo Zheng display such a frosty sword move so casually, he pondered on it in silence.</p>

  <p>The young boy at the Soul Sea Realm seemed to execute the martial skill without using his life vitality. How was it possible?</p>
