<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>



  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nathan was harboring a deep resentment towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even though he was facing a life and death moment, he couldn't push back his feelings of anger for the other man. In fact, it seemed like he couldn't care less about his own life and death.</p>

  <p>"How dare you! Do you know who he is?" Lawson reprimanded.</p>

  <p>The magical light of five elements flashed as Lucille's killing intent surged within her beautiful eyes.</p>

  <p>These three warriors came from the same great force, after all� they had special status. No one had ever thought they would perish here. Seeing the grand sorcerer thrusting out his cane, Lawson couldn't help but blurt out the question.</p>

  <p>Lawson's threat might have worked if they were facing other forces.</p>

  <p>Being the descendant of Supreme Lord of Original Sin, if Nathan was killed, the person who killed him would undoubtedly meet their own death.</p>

  <p>But to the grand sorcerer, such a threat only sounded ridiculous.</p>

  <p>The sorcerer race was fighting against the entire universe� something they had plotted for hundreds of millions of years. How could he possibly fear Supreme Lord of Original Sin?</p>

  <p>And this time, the purpose of his attack was to exterminate these eight Godly Geniuses!</p>

  <p>The moment the shadow of the insect on the tip of the cane rushed towards Nathan, a figure suddenly appeared behind him.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Huh?" The scene left Mu Ning stunned, but she was unable to stop it� all happened so fast and it was too late for her to stop it.</p>

  <p>Kurt, Tianming, and all the others were then wearing different expressions.</p>

  <p>None of them were expecting Luo Zheng to block the attack on Nathan.</p>

  <p>Even Nathan was looking at him strangely.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>The white jade cane struck Zheng's fist.</p>

  <p>The Nether Spring Cicada attached to the tip of the cane flashed a black light that got into Zheng's fist.</p>

  <p>It was an extremely powerful creature. If it were to get into someone's body, it could extinguish the person's life energy in an instant. Even a world lord would fall to death under the cicada's power.</p>

  <p>Seeing that he had succeeded, the grand sorcerer sneered. Then, he turned into black smoke and dodged Lawson's and Lucille's attacks before reappearing a dozen feet away. Although he had been fighting with the kids for quite a long time, these Godly Geniuses would eventually die in his hands, one after another. With this in mind, the process of killing them was something he could enjoy.</p>

  <p>Before long, Zheng's life energy would be devoured completely� he'd end up a living corpse before perishing into nothing.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!" Mu Ning rushed over to Zheng's side, her heart aching in concern.</p>

  <p>The battle between the two sides froze for a minute. But then everyone's eyes focused on Luo Zheng as they waited for death to come.</p>

  <p>Only Luo Zheng remained expressionless as he stared at the grand sorcerer.</p>

  <p>Then, he smiled.</p>

  <p>After a moment, the sneer on the grand sorcerer's face turned into a look of disbelief.</p>

  <p>As for Lucille, Mu Ning, and the rest, their expressions of sorrow turned to joy.</p>

  <p>"This... This is impossible!" the grand sorcerer roared.</p>

  <p>Being a grand sorcerer of the sorcerer race, he was well aware of how terrifying the Nether Spring Cicada was. The Nether Spring Cicada was one of the famous magical insects of the race� it was extremely powerful. The move wouldn't be called the Deadly Cane Strike if anyone could be left unaffected after the insect made its way into their body.</p>

  <p>These Godly Geniuses had indeed stepped into the Godly Way, but this didn't make them invincible. The sorcerer race originated from the divine land and the grand sorcerer was left at a loss� he couldn't fathom the idea that Luo Zheng was still alive.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng wasn't completely unaffected.</p>

  <p>The small insect that had entered Zheng's body left him in shock� he could feel his own life energy madly gushing out of his body. If he continued to lose his life energy at such a speed, his life energy would run out in a minute.</p>

  <p>But in just an instant, Luo Zheng began transferring the power he had received.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng himself had no good impression of Nathan. The two, Nathan and Lawson seemed to be fond of spouting nonsense which made Luo Zheng feel even more hateful.</p>

  <p>But the ten warriors in the heavens had already been decided. Even Nathan couldn't accept this fact. Still, he had to admit Zheng's identity just as Luo Zheng had to accept his.</p>

  <p>He couldn't possibly let the guy die here.</p>

  <p>As he fought in this great world, Luo Zheng had a huge advantage.</p>

  <p>Since he fused with the will of the great world, he had become an indestructible presence. Only if the great world was completely destroyed would Luo Zheng fall to death.</p>

  <p>At this moment, within several forests of the great world, the trees withered at a rate the eye could follow.</p>

  <p>The Nether Spring Cicada's attack was similar to that of Eddie's Life and Death Wind back then, but the insect's attack was undoubtedly much stronger.</p>

  <p>Wherever the Life and Death Wind went, the people within range would lose their lives. But its power to eliminate life energy was rather limited� this was why Ning Yudie had managed to escape death before. This time, Luo Zheng had sacrificed tens of thousands of acres of forest in the Central Region before finally stopping the transfer of power.</p>

  <p>"Come on!" Suddenly, Luo Zheng raised his sword.</p>

  <p>The frozen battle came back to life, but the auras of the eight Godly Geniuses were now completely different.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Zheng took the lead as lightning bolts shot out from the Thunder Wind Divine Sword and madly rushed towards the grand sorcerer.</p>

  <p>Tianming seemed like a ray of light� every time he flashed, the sword radiance would shoot out at the same time. Lone, Lucille, and the rest didn't give the grand sorcerer a chance to catch his breath. Their momentum was growing more and more intimidating.</p>

  <p>On the other side, the grand sorcerer was steadily losing ground as he faced the warriors' sharp attacks.</p>

  <p>Nathan held tightly onto his spear as he glanced at Luo Zheng attacking from the very front of the group. In his heart, Nathan came to a realization.</p>

  <p>Even though he had lost to Luo Zheng, he couldn't accept it.</p>

  <p>In his mind, Zheng's existence was an omission from the heavens� he attributed his defeat to his bad luck. Or perhaps, he had lost to Luo Zheng because of the patriarch's interference. This defeat was like a thorn in his heart that he couldn't get rid of� his suffering was constant.</p>

  <p>Only now did Nathan realize that there was something special about Luo Zheng that he himself just did not possess.</p>

  <p>Nathan didn't know how Luo Zheng managed to survive the grand sorcerer's attack, but if he were in Zheng's shoes, he definitely wouldn't have gotten in the way and taken on the attack for someone else.</p>

  <p>He was a Godly Genius, meaning his existence was important. If someone had to die, it wouldn't be him� such was what he and the elders of the Xuanyuan Clan always believed.</p>

  <p>It was a selfish thought, but it was justified. Still, a justified thought wasn't necessarily always the best.</p>

  <p>"I owe you this time," Nathan muttered to himself before lifting his spear and following behind Luo Zheng to join the attack.</p>

  <p>That night, the skies above the Central Region rumbled continuously.</p>

  <p>From time to time, lighting would erupt before flames filled the sky, burning brightly and illuminating half the sky.</p>

  <p>As they continued fighting, the situation began to turn one-sided.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng transferred all the power that was meant to weaken him, he showed no fear toward the grand sorcerer's tricks at all. Instead, he continued following the grand sorcerer like a shadow as he made his attacks.</p>

  <p>The other Godly Geniuses' attacks weren't to be ignored either. Although the grand sorcerer had the cultivation of a world lord, he wasn't indestructible. And Nathan's Law Spear Strike was a deadly threat.</p>

  <p>Under the full attack of the eight Godly Geniuses, the grand sorcerer's body was soon covered with wounds gushing green blood.</p>

  <p>It was an unprecedented result� a dignified world lord was pushed into such a miserable state by a group of kids at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>These eight young warriors were originally the grand sorcerer's targets, but their positions had reversed� the Godly Geniuses were now chasing after the grand sorcerer!</p>

  <p>Even more troublesome was the Smoky Heart-locking Curse.</p>

  <p>While the sorcerer race's spells were extremely powerful, they also had negative effects.</p>

  <p>For example, after the death of the sorcerer slaves and the war sorcerers, they would produce strong curses. And the small skulls from the curses were almost impossible to damage. An ordinary martial artist had no solution to get rid of them. But the fact that these skulls came at the cost of numerous lives couldn't be ignored.</p>

  <p>The law of conservation never failed. To reach the highest level of the Emotion Closing Godly Way, one had to completely abandon their emotions and sacrifice their six desires. This was why the Emotion Closing Godly Way was so powerful. The same logic applied to a sorcerer's spells.</p>

  <p>After the Smoky Heart-locking Curse was cast, the grand sorcerer's own heart was then locked with the hearts of the eight Godly Geniuses. He couldn't remove the curse himself.</p>

  <p>In such a miserable state, the grand sorcerer finally made a decision. He tore open a space crack and snuck into the back side of the great world.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng and the others were intent on killing� how could they just let the guy go?</p>

  <p>They chased after him through the space crack. When they entered the back side of the great world, they were left shocked at the scene before them.</p>

  <p>It was as if someone had cast a strong spell on the grand sorcerer. He stood there, unmoving.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the great world, Luo Zheng finally saw the complete body of the tail.</p>

  <p>The length of this Torch Dragon exceeded Zheng's imagination. Its slender body looked like that of a snake, and on it rested the head of a dragon.</p>

  <p>Atop the dragon head, a raging fire was burning.</p>

  <p>The Torch Dragon was also called the Candle Dragon. Legend had it that the flame atop the Candle Dragon's head was as chaotic as a candle flame.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the Torch Dragon fiercely battled Supreme Lord Mirage.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and the others stepped into the space crack, they had unwittingly barged into the center of another battle!</p>
