<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dale's words displeased the Primeval Lord of Heaven. He was annoyed at what the former thought.</p>

  <p>The human heroes' energy souls had stayed inside Zheng's inner world before. Once there, they had spent a lot of time and energy in making it a better place.</p>

  <p>Compared to the inner worlds of other people, Zheng's inner world could easily be marked as one of the best.</p>

  <p>But Dale was saying that it was a desolate place, and the Primeval Lord of Heaven felt humiliated.</p>

  <p>"Ahem..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven tried to hide his anger with a cough and then asked, "Dale, this inner world is built according to the human race's Heaven and Earth Separation Method. What's more, the world runs remarkably well considering its complexity. Why are you saying that it is a desolate place?"</p>

  <p>Dale glanced at the Primeval Lord of Heaven and then explained with a smile, "It is true that the Heaven and Earth Separation Method is the best way to build the inner worlds of ordinary warriors. However, that is not valid here. This is the primitive land. Even if the world runs so well, it's of no use here. It's too small..."</p>

  <p>Once again, Zheng's inner world was not small, especially when compared to those of ordinary warriors. One could even say that it was remarkably larger than people usually thought possible.</p>

  <p>Dale, however, was coming up with these comments because he was judging that world by the standards of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Compared to the Source World, Zheng's inner world was easily as tiny as a dust particle.</p>

  <p>This time, the Primeval Lord of Heaven did not refute his statement.</p>

  <p>Instead, he asked, "Do you know a way to expand his inner world?"</p>

  <p>After the Primeval Lord of Heaven's soul fragment had entered Zheng's inner world, he had also tried his best to expand it, but had been unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>Theoretically, it had the potential to grow infinitely.</p>

  <p>In fact, when the Source World was born, it wasn't as huge as its contemporary presence. It had slowly expanded over time by devouring the chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>But the Primeval Lord of Heaven had been unsuccessful because to be honest, he didn't know much about the primitive land, and therefore, couldn't find a way to expand it. In the end, he had been left with no choice but to treat the primitive land as an ordinary inner world.</p>

  <p>"Of course." Dale nodded. "I know a way, which is also the key to controlling the ancestry-level bloodline."</p>

  <p>Once warriors reached the Other Shore Realm, then the inner worlds became less important. The biggest function of these inner worlds was to carry the objects their owners had obtained from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Chaotic Source Realm and the Holy Soul Realm were merely enhanced realms on the Other Shore Realm. The real change happened when one entered the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>At that point, their inner world became almost completely insignificant.</p>

  <p>It was true that the bloodline inherited from the Eternal Scroll Painting could affect the inner world.</p>

  <p>For example, Fuxi had created huge Eight Diagrams in his inner world.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess' shadows were flying around everywhere in her inner world. The inner world could also store a portion of the bloodline power.</p>

  <p>However, the capacity was limited. The amount of bloodline power that could be stored was less than one-tenth of the cultivators' own power. That could be easily overlooked.</p>

  <p>"What should I do?" Zheng asked in a confused tone.</p>

  <p>Judging by what Dale was saying, it looked like he had completely ignored the real function of his inner world.</p>

  <p>He was omniscient in his inner world, but that omniscience did not reach outside.</p>

  <p>And expanding his own inner world was beyond Zheng's talents and knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Direct the ancestry-level bloodline into your inner world, and this will allow you to create a world of blood and flesh," said Dale.</p>

  <p>Zheng, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess looked at each other with a confused expression on their faces. They couldn't understand what Dale was saying. How was he supposed to create a world of flesh and blood?</p>

  <p>"That is what that human spirit told us," Dale continued explaining.</p>

  <p>"However, my master told me that the human spirit was not fully confident of its success. It is only a conjecture that the ancestry-level bloodline can be controlled in the primitive land. And now, Zheng has a chance to verify this conjecture!"</p>

  <p>Dale's proposal was interesting. The domain Zheng had got his hands on was something that the Four Spirits Sect had never reached, or perhaps even heard of.</p>

  <p>The advantage was that he might obtain power that even the Human Spirit King, the Monkey Spirit King, the Bird Sprit King, or the Snake Spirit King could never catch up with. However, the flip side was that no one knew what he should do next. His only way forward was to explore the unknown bit by bit. Even the human spirit had only pointed out a possibility...</p>

  <p>"So you are not going to teach him the cultivation method of the ancestry-level bloodline?" The Snake Goddess curled her lips. Her expectations had been raised after hearing the possibilities a few moments ago, but now Dale was telling them it was all just a conjecture. Was he kidding?</p>

  <p>"There is no cultivation method..." Dale shook his head.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven still did not seem discouraged. Instead, he suddenly asked, "That human spirit you're talking about... Is his surname Xue?"</p>

  <p>Dale's eyes opened wide in shock. "How did you know..."</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful the Primeval Lord of Heaven was, it was impossible for him to guess that human spirit's surname. Some secrets were way too hidden even for people like him to find out. But he had.</p>

  <p>Not only that, Zheng's and the Snake Goddess's eyes also flickered. Then the Snake Goddess piped up, "If our guess is right, then the human spirit should be Elder Xue from the Bold Conjecture House!"</p>

  <p>When they had looked through the stone tablets of the Monkey Spirit Sect, they had found a few clues about the ancestry-level bloodline. In addition to Kincaid, who was the Human Spirit King, another highly important name that they had come across was of Elder Xue. In order to find a way to merge with the ancestry-level bloodline, Elder Xue had gone to the Deep Space. And no news had been heard of or from him ever since.</p>

  <p>When the Primeval Lord of Heaven had heard the word "conjecture", the name had crossed his mind immediately and he'd just blurted it out without too much thought. He never could have expected that he would end up being right.</p>

  <p>"Elder Xue's achievements with regards to the ancestry-level bloodline should not be considered inferior to that of the Human Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had gone to the Deep Space and chances are, he might have gained something whilst he was there," the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied with a smile. "Although I don't know much about the main world, judging by what the records on those stone tablets say, I also came up with a few conclusions. Since the ancestry-level bloodline is from the Deep Space, a way to control it is likely to be found there as well. That makes Elder Xue the most likely one to find it."</p>

  <p>"I can give what you said a shot," Zheng piped up.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had been unable to activate ancestry-level bloodline at will.</p>

  <p>But after cultivating the Blood-controlling Method, it was not a difficult task for him.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, his avatar sat down cross legged and floated up into the air inside his inner world.</p>

  <p>To be honest, he still had some doubts in his heart.</p>

  <p>Although the Blood-controlling Method allowed him to activate the ancestry-level bloodline, it only allowed the simplest usage of the bloodline. Furthermore, it was unable to provide him with a means to divide the ancestry-level bloodline. Once a portion of the ancestry-level bloodline was forced into his inner world, it would definitely cause some backlash! He had to be ready for that.</p>

  <p>There were risks, but Zheng also knew that often, a mere thought, word, or idea that ordinary people couldn't even imagine coming up with, could work wonders.</p>

  <p>The moment the first drop of the ancestry-level bloodline was injected into his inner world, Zheng's body began to tremble violently.</p>

  <p>His entire body turned as white as paper all of a sudden, and all trace of blood vanished from every single part of his body. Even his eyes, ears, nose and mouth were drained of color.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline couldn't wait to leave Zheng's physical body and madly rushed into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng's meridians were completely dried up, his life force quickly faded away, as if he was about to die.</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, Zheng's real body and his avatar in his inner world fell down with a flop. His body seemed cold now.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess saw this scene, her expression changed. She quickly withdrew her soul fragment from Zheng's inner world. She couldn't let Zheng die.</p>

  <p>With a gentle wave of her hand, a green leaf appeared in the center of her palm. She grabbed Zheng's jaw and forcefully stuffed the leaf into his mouth.</p>

  <p>This leaf was known as the Heavenly Immortal Leaf and it contained an enormous amount of life energy. Once Zheng had absorbed enough life energy, his face turned red once again, and the blood in his body began to flow once more. However, the blood flowing in his meridians was no longer the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The ancestry-level bloodline was now inside his inner world and floating around like a free child. It suddenly turned into a huge mass of blood mist and spread out in all directions at an astonishing rate, enveloping his entire inner world like radiation.</p>

  <p>A gust of wind blew, and a fishy and sweet smell spread throughout every corner of his inner world.</p>
