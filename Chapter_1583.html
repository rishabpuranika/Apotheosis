  <p>
</p>

  <p>To be honest, Luo Luo Zheng didn't really know what Lucille meant to Janet's heart.</p>

  <p>It was known that the Thoughtless Minds had four great clans.</p>

  <p>One was Lucille's clan, and the next one was Janet's clan, while the other two were the Xuanyuan Clan and the Sun Clan.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the four clans were the most famous of their kind among the humans in the universe.</p>

  <p>Even those Supreme Lords wouldn't be able to develop their clans to reach the four great clans' level.</p>

  <p>The four great clans were great powers that supported the human race.</p>

  <p>They cooperated well and strengthened their connection with marriages.</p>

  <p>In addition, they held a great competition amongst themselves. It was safe to say that these four clans affected the thousands of supreme worlds of the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>In one previous great competition among the four clans, Nathan Xuanyuan had not risen to prominence yet.</p>

  <p>The image of Lucille standing at the peak was deeply engraved in Janet's mind till now.</p>

  <p>For her, almost no human martial artist from the younger generation could fight against Lucille.</p>

  <p>Nathan Xuanyuan rose to power primarily because he had merged with the Heavenly Fragment and subsequently became a Godly Genius. If Lucille could truly comprehend the Five Elements Godly Way, she would also be a Godly Genius. If so, Janet felt that Nathan couldn't even match up to Lucille.</p>

  <p>No one among the Soul Sea Realm warriors could defeat Lucille. Or at least, that was what Janet thought.</p>

  <p>Thus, she was stunned when she suddenly heard Luo Luo Zheng said that Lucille had lost.</p>

  <p>She stared blankly at Luo Luo Zheng, disbelief written all over her pretty face.</p>

  <p>The fusion of the five elements that Luo Luo Zheng practiced was indeed a Ji Clan's secret technique, but this was not conclusive evidence for Janet that he could defeat Lucille. Perhaps Lucille taught this secret technique to Luo Luo Zheng for some reason, but that did not mean that she would lose to him.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was confused by Janet's reaction at first, he quickly understood a bit and smiled, "What? You don't believe me?"</p>

  <p>Janet stared at Luo Luo Zheng and cautiously asked, "When you saw Lucille, what color was the snow behind her?"</p>

  <p>"Is it important?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously. "What color?" Janet repeated.</p>

  <p>"White." "Pure white?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt exasperated at Janet's question, but she continued.</p>

  <p>"Yes! One hundred percent pure white!" he answered helplessly.</p>

  <p>Janet sighed in relief when she finally got an answer from him. "No wonder!"</p>

  <p>"No wonder what?"</p>

  <p>Janet's lips curved into a wide grin.</p>

  <p>"I guess you did win against Lucille, but that was only because Lucille exerted half of her strength. Technically, she only used sixty percent of her strength at most," she said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Understanding then fell upon Luo Zheng's face when he heard what Janet said.</p>

  <p>The Lucille he saw last time seemed to have something special.</p>

  <p>When Janet saw Luo Zheng's strange expression, she continued, "Lucille practices the cultivation method named One Soul in Two Bodies. Your victory against Lucille last time can't count as a real one. If she fused with Lucy, then that would be her true strength. Only by defeating Lucille at that time, you could be considered to be truly stronger than her!"</p>

  <p>'One Soul in Two Bodies? And who is Lucy?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brows slightly rose.</p>

  <p>It was true that Lucille was the strongest opponent Luo Luo Zheng had met in the Illusion Battlefield. However, Luo Luo Zheng had never thought that she was still not at her full strength at that time.</p>

  <p>Judging from the name One Soul in Two Bodies, it seemed that Lucille had a clone named Lucy who was about the same level as her.</p>

  <p>"I hope I would still get a chance to fight her!" Luo Luo Zheng said and smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"You will! When the time comes, you'll know how terrifying Lucille actually is." Janet nodded.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Luo Zheng didn't think too much about if Lucille's strength was really as terrifying as Janet had said.</p>

  <p>Besides, he still needed to raise his ranking continuously in order for the competition to bear fruit. He had no time to think about other things.</p>

  <p>Another five minutes had passed as he climbed up the stairs.</p>

  <p>Everyone had already arrived at the mountainside, where another Hall of Causality had appeared.</p>

  <p>However, this Hall of Causality was several times larger and wider than the previous one.</p>

  <p>There were eight warriors in front of the Hall of Causality, who were already waiting for Janet and Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They were actually waiting for Janet, to be exact.</p>

  <p>Janet had always been the leader. Only she was familiar with the Halls of Causality, so no one wanted to enter the hall without her at the helm.</p>

  <p>"The second Hall of Causality." Janet looked at it and said, "Every Hall of Causality is different. Whether or not you can pass it depends not only on your own strength, but also your own reaction and judgment. The difficulty of passing the second Hall of Causality will greatly increase!</p>

  <p>Be careful, guys!"</p>

  <p>Then, Janet walked in without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>The others followed suit after she went in.</p>

  <p>"This hall..."</p>

  <p>There was nothing but white light that shot out of the walls in the first Hall of Causality, which was quite simple to pass through. As long as everyone was careful, the warriors at the Soul Sea Realm or even a weaker one could easily pass through the first Hall of Causality. It was also why the first hall was worth only one hundred Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the floors and walls of the second Hall of Causality were bathed in a thin layer of gold, which made it look luxurious.</p>

  <p>There were many enormous square stones in the center of the hall.</p>

  <p>These square stones were thirty feet high, thirty feet wide, and thirty feet long. There were complex carved patterns made by an unknown race on their surfaces.</p>

  <p>The warriors were at least several dozen feet away from those square stones as they looked at them. They looked left and right, but couldn't tell anything special about the stones. In the end, they all turned towards Janet.</p>

  <p>Now, Janet still wondered how strong Luo Luo Zheng really was and was guessing his true identity.</p>

  <p>Janet's strongest ability should be slightly stronger than half of Lucille's power. Since Luo Luo Zheng said that he had defeated Lucille, she pondered about how much strength he exerted to win against Lucille last time. However, there were too many factors that determined victory or defeat in a martial artists' fight. It usually depended on one's strength, but it could also be affected by one's mentality, luck, or even how much one paid attention to details!</p>

  <p>Perhaps Janet would need to challenge Luo Luo Zheng if she wanted to know how strong he was. It was just that the Hall of Causality wasn't suitable for a fight, but she should have a chance when she reached the Illusion Battlefield's final test.</p>

  <p>Her mind was such a mess that she didn't notice everyone's eyes were on her again until now. "The Hall of Causality is different every time. This is also the first time I've seen it," she said snappily.</p>

  <p>"She's right. How can we let a girl shoulder the risk of leading us?" a human warrior said with a smile. "Since no one wants to take the first step, let me do it!"</p>

  <p>After that, he pulled out a sword from the scabbard that hung around his waist. He picked up the long sword with narrowed eyes; then, faint blue dots of light appeared and flickered after he closed eyes.</p>

  <p>The blue dots of light slowly took the shape of a human, and then it finally completely transformed into that human martial artist's appearance.</p>

  <p>"Sword spirit!" Luo Zheng's eyes slightly flashed when he saw the warrior's sword spirit.</p>

  <p>"What a solid sword spirit!"</p>

  <p>"It would be perfect to use a sword spirit to scout the way!"</p>

  <p>"Now that we don't understand the rules of this Hall of Causality, we may die early if we're not careful. It's a pity that we don't have any puppeteers in the team."</p>

  <p>They had gotten somewhat familiar with the Halls of Causality after they passed the first one.</p>

  <p>At first, they were all shocked when they heard the words "Law of Causality." The others would have a hard time passing through the Hall of Causality if someone in the hall had mastered some kind of Law of Causality--even if the one were only at the Soul Sea Realm. After all, some Laws of Causality were too powerful for anyone to risk going against them.</p>

  <p>After they had observed for a while, they concluded that the trials in the Hall of Causality had some certain rules. One still had a small chance of passing through after having figured out the rules.</p>

  <p>The sword spirit of that warrior was indeed incomparably solid, but it still had some minor flaws compared to Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng's sword spirit materialized, it was no different from a real person. On the other hand, the human martial artist's sword spirit was still a bit imperfect that one could tell that it was illusory when looking at it closely. However, it was already good enough to be able to condense a sword spirit to this degree.</p>

  <p>After the sword spirit took form, it walked towards the center of the hall.</p>

  <p>Everyone's gazes were fixated on it.</p>

  <p>It was still quiet from the hall's entrance to the central section. But just as the sword spirit approached a giant stone, it suddenly shook and rolled before it aggressively crushed down the sword spirit.</p>
