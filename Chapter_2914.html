  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although these people had nothing to do with Tianming's death, Luo Zheng did not intend to let them get away this time.</p>

  <p>They had picked their side; now, they had to pay a price.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng finished speaking, the thunder wings on his back suddenly spread, and he charged toward the person closest to him.</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>Eleven people broke away from the crowd and ran toward the valley.</p>

  <p>These people's hearts were full of regret because they allowed themselves to be fooled by Leyton. Luo Zheng was so powerful that attacking the three of them was simply courting death.</p>

  <p>However, it was already too late for regrets.</p>

  <p>A young Demi-holy Being who was at the back of the group had only run over a hundred feet when he felt a burning sensation above his head. As it turned out, a thin red lotus was coming at him.</p>

  <p>"Spiritual Energy Gathering Shield!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, a large cyan shield appeared over his head.</p>

  <p>This huge shield, which had consumed nearly all of his internal momentum, could block the all-out blow from a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, his opponent now was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The moment the red lotus touched the huge shield, the energy of the whole cyan shield changed, and the shield transformed into a red lotus covering the young man.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the young Demi-holy Being was incinerated to ashes.</p>

  <p>The remaining ten was stupefied at the sight.</p>

  <p>That young man was a Demi-holy Being from a first-tier clan. He was among the top Demi-holy Beings from outside the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Even so, he could not withstand the least of Luo Zheng's attacks. Thus, the others would definitely be slaughtered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not stop after killing the first young Demi-holy Being. He flew toward the next target with his thunder wings.</p>

  <p>When the second Demi-holy Being saw Luo Zheng coming straight at him, he panicked, shouting, "I don't know anything! I mean no harm..."</p>

  <p>"You mean no harm now, but when you attacked us, this was not what you thought," Luo Zheng replied faintly.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>With one roll of the red lotus, the Demi-holy Being was also consumed.</p>

  <p>When the remaining nine people saw this, their hearts sank. An old man gritted his teeth and said, "We won't be able to make it out alive this way!</p>

  <p>Let's join forces and fight him with all our might!"</p>

  <p>These Demi-holy Beings were smart. They knew that they would die before reaching the end of the valley because they were still far from it and Luo Zheng killed fast. Since they would never survive anyway, it was worth a shot.</p>

  <p>The nine Demi-holy Beings abruptly halted. Pressured by their debilitating fear, they all burst forth with surprising power, exerting all of their internal momentum and the most powerful skills.</p>

  <p>With their cooperation, even the Holy Beings would have a hard time fending off their attack.</p>

  <p>Any Holy Beings who had experienced the battle in the Abyss Demon Region would have shaken their heads at this scene. The joint attack might have worked on others, but not on Luo Zheng or Tianming.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>A cacophony of sounds rang out, and numerous thunderbolts and ice spears shot toward Luo Zheng at the same time.</p>

  <p>These various theurgies maximized their internal momentum, but all were transformed into red lotuses before they reached Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng couldn't establish a connection with Tianming now, there could have been a way out of their predicament through their cooperation, because the energy that the red-eyed girl could absorb and transform was limited.</p>

  <p>However the joint forces of the nine Demi-holy Beings were not enough to reach her limit.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>All of the theurgies that came to attack Luo Zheng were transformed without ceasing until, finally, there were hundreds of red lotuses. With a gentle push of Luo Zheng's hand, the red lotuses hurtled through the valley, and the Demi-holy Beings blocking their path turned into ashes upon contact.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing Luo Zheng's return, the other people on the plain remained silent.</p>

  <p>Many of them had been tempted to make a move, but now they were secretly glad that they did not provoke Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng arrived at the plain, his gaze once again fell on Alfredo.</p>

  <p>Under Luo Zheng's cold regard, Alfredo's body trembled violently.</p>

  <p>He was a member of the Han Clan, and he held a grudge against Luo Zheng. It wasn't difficult for Luo Zheng to kill him now.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng only cast an indifferent glance at him without saying anything.</p>

  <p>As Alfredo heaved a sigh of relief, he heard Luo Zheng's voice. "Your life was spared for Kelsey's sake. If you understood the situation, then you would leave the Han Clan with Kelsey immediately after leaving the Mountain of Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>Alfredo had not given that course of action much thought, but after hearing what Luo Zheng said, he thought twice and quickly made a decision.</p>

  <p>With Samuel being of no use, the Han Clan was met by a catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't say anything. He silently stared at the plain ahead, thinking about Tianming's reincarnation.</p>

  <p>For such a secondary creature like Tianming, the Memory Flame in the divine land was incomplete.</p>

  <p>It was not capable of restoring Tianming's memories in the Evolutionary Universe. What Luo Zheng could see were Tianming's memories after he had entered the divine land.</p>

  <p>In other words, if Tianming was reborn, his memory would be incomplete.</p>

  <p>Considering that his father, Mike, was the master of the Evolutionary Universe, Luo Zheng wondered whether it was possible for him to retrieve Tianming's lost memories.</p>

  <p>At that point, Luo Zheng was incapable of doing this to the creatures in his inner world. He could easily know anything happened anywhere and at any point in time within his inner world, but he still couldn't extract creatures' memories.</p>

  <p>However, his inner world wasn't as perfect as the universe. He hoped that his father could grant his friend's memories a complete recovery.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng was lost in thought, Sword Chen approached him. With his eyes staring into the distance, he said, "Something has changed on the plain."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked into the distance and saw rays of light rising from the surface of the plain, emitting a vast expanse of silver light. In the depths of the plain, several silver ribbon-like things streamed up to the sky like fountains.</p>

  <p>"The holy springs have appeared!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that there would be five holy springs this time!"</p>

  <p>"How come there are so many of them?"</p>

  <p>These Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods were still thinking of the chance to become a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Sword Chen were not the sort of men that they could challenge. If only one or two holy springs had appeared, their chances would have been nil because there was no way for them to succeed against Luo Zheng in battle.</p>

  <p>However, everyone was surprised to witness five holy springs burst forth in the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Every holy spring meant an opportunity for someone to become a Holy Being, and Luo Zheng and Sword Chen only needed two of the springs. This meant that three holy springs were available for the rest of them to fight for.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng leaped slightly and flew toward one of the holy springs. Watching him, Sword Chen nodded and selected another holy spring a bit far away from Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>The others consciously avoided the two holy springs that were selected and decided to fight with all their might for the other three holy springs.</p>
