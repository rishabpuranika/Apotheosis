  <p>
</p>

  <p>The finger in the spider man's hand seemed ordinary, but a strange flame lingered around it.</p>

  <p>Even though he was exceptionally strong, he instantly felt an unbearable pain when he touched it.</p>

  <p>He had been trapped in the cube for countless years and endured all kinds of torture.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't take the pain from the formless flame around Luo Zheng's hand. He quickly withdrew his hand.</p>

  <p>But how could he give up such a great opportunity?</p>

  <p>As soon as he pulled out his hand, he spat out the green spider silk towards Luo Zheng's hand.</p>

  <p>The spider silk was his race's unique ability. His race lived between space layers and inside space cracks, so the spider silk also had a special space quality.</p>

  <p>No one else could break the spider silk they released.</p>

  <p>The spider silk quickly wrapped around Luo Zheng's hand, and at the same time, the spider man's eight legs stepped back. Then, he unleashed a powerful force that pulled Luo Zheng into the square space.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng didn't use the Celestial Spear, he wouldn't be as strong as the spider man in terms of strength alone.</p>

  <p>The spider man became extremely excited when he saw that Luo Zheng was pulled into the space by him.</p>

  <p>If he successfully pulled in a person, then he would be able to leave this damned place!</p>

  <p>Still, he wouldn't kill Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He wanted to keep Luo Zheng alive, so Luo Zheng would also be tortured and suffer in living hell.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He tried to rush out of the square space, but a loud "bang" sound followed after he came into contact with the space's inner wall. He slammed into the wall, and the space still prevented him from leaving.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>Out of panic, he stretched out a long, thin leg and stabbed the inner wall.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The wall also blocked his leg. He was very desperate now.</p>

  <p>"How could this be? This is impossible! It's simply impossible..."</p>

  <p>He turned around and saw Luo Zheng, who calmly stood on the other side with a faint smile on his face. At that moment, he suddenly realized something.</p>

  <p>It must be Luo Zheng who played those tricks!</p>

  <p>Previously, Luo Zheng had been very cautious and didn't even dare to approach the square space. Now that he suddenly dared to come in, he must have done something!</p>

  <p>"What did you do?</p>

  <p>Let me out!</p>

  <p>Or else, I will kill you!"</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The spider man's legs began to glow. It was clear that he only wanted to kill Luo Zheng now because he was upset.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Zheng just looked around and said with a smile, "It seems that the inner space is still big. It should be smaller..."</p>

  <p>The moment he finished speaking, his figure flashed and left the square space.</p>

  <p>When he left, the space began to shrink.</p>

  <p>This place could become large or small in the first place. After the spider man stayed inside it for so long, he had understood the Infinite Time and Space to a certain degree, and he could also adjust the internal space.</p>

  <p>However, he encountered Luo Zheng this time.</p>

  <p>As the origin-level bloodline, the Infinite Time and Space was originally derived from the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The moment Luo Zheng touched the square space, he had already analyzed the structure of the Infinite Time and Space, and also grasped the method to control such energy.</p>

  <p>As the space continued to shrink, the spider man's fear also increased. "How did you do it? Did you fuse with the Infinite Time and Space? Why? Why?"</p>

  <p>He was naturally afraid, and as a result, the energy in his legs erupted.</p>

  <p>Numerous light pillars with destructive powers swept through the space's inner walls. Yet, the square space remained unmoved, and he couldn't do anything but watch it shrink further.</p>

  <p>When the space shrank to about ten feet in length, the spider man felt his body get squeezed.</p>

  <p>In turn, he tried his best to curl up and adapt to the increasingly small space.</p>

  <p>But when the space shrank to five feet in length, he finally couldn't bear the pressure anymore. Cracking sounds filled the air as his eight legs broke, and his big body was squashed.</p>

  <p>"Let's stop here," Luo Zheng said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Let me out, please..." the spider man managed to croak out a plea for mercy.</p>

  <p>His face was squeezed against the space's inner wall, while his eyes and nose pressed into a flat plane.</p>

  <p>At that point, the pain he felt was a hundred times greater than before. It was an extremely terrifying torture that even made him wish for death.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng turned around and left as if he didn't know what happened or hear the spider man's begging. He didn't care about the spider man's situation at all.</p>

  <p>After all, the spider man was determined to kill him. If he hadn't gotten lucky enough, he would've been trapped there for the rest of his life.</p>

  <p>He had no mercy for such an opponent.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>He stepped forward and headed for another space, which was the location of the bloodline called Myriad Birth and Destruction.</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>He stood on the ground again. Then a seedling drilled into his feet and spread along his legs.</p>

  <p>He didn't struggle or move, and instead allowed the seedling to grow.</p>

  <p>When it grew and took shape, he gently stepped back.</p>

  <p>A tree that outlined the meridians all over his body took shape.</p>

  <p>Technically speaking, the tree should dissipate on its own after he moved away from it.</p>

  <p>This time, however, something unexpected happened.</p>

  <p>He reached out his hand and gently stroked the tree. The tree then glowed with an emerald light and emitted the aura of vitality.</p>

  <p>"It looks like after I fused with the ancestry-level bloodline, I can grasp the origin-level bloodlines quickly," he commented happily. Then, he took another step forward and returned to the second space.</p>

  <p>There was an Ouroboros carved on the bronze mountain in the second space. It was the space of the bloodline called Ultimate Cycle.</p>

  <p>Among the four origin-level bloodlines, the Infinite Reproduction, the Myriad Birth and Destruction, and the Infinite Time and Space had roughly visible outlines. However, the meaning of the Ultimate Cycle was unknown. Even its form was invisible.</p>

  <p>Now that he had the ancestry-level bloodline as his support, Luo Zheng became curious and naturally wanted to comprehend it.</p>

  <p>In a split second, he stood on the bronze mountain, just at the center of the Ouroboros.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>An invisible wave came from the Ouroboros. Then, the Ouroboros' statue began to move, and it swallowed its tail bit by bit.</p>

  <p>Although the snake devoured itself, its tail also continued to grow. Such a process was an infinite cycle.</p>

  <p>When the Ouroboros began to rotate, Luo Zheng also felt that the ancestry-level bloodline in his body had started to react.</p>

  <p>A strange image surrounded him, and a world that developed in endless cycles appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>Everything in that world grew and then died. Soon enough, a new world was born.</p>

  <p>"Is this the chaos?</p>

  <p>Or is it similar to the chaos?" he asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Just then, several similar worlds appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>Just like the previous world, those worlds were also destroyed and quickly revived, full of life.</p>
