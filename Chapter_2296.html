  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2296 The Rankings </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The change in the rankings of the thirty-six Floating Islands on the Time Sea started from the bottom.</p>

  <p>Originally, the Floating Island of the Luo Clan had been ranked third to last. But while the Floating Islands of the Xie Clan and the Liu Clan moved upward, the Luo Clan's Floating Island slowly descended.</p>

  <p>According to the ranking rules, the last one on the list would be expelled from the Time Sea, after which it would be replaced by a new clan's Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Of course, the new clan would need to have at least a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The strongest Holy Beings in the divine land were almost all gathered in the Time Sea, but there were a few exceptions. There were a few large clans with Holy Beings outside of the Time Sea, but they were still too weak to compete with the powerful clans on the Floating Islands, so they didn't have the capability to have a Floating Island on the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>"Will the Luo Clan be replaced this time?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. The Hall of Holy Beings has long been dissatisfied with the empty Floating Island of the Luo Clan. No one is there, but it holds a seat!"</p>

  <p>"The Xie Clan and the Liu Clan that came from the east of the divine land have the support of the Dongfang Clan. And this time, they have performed extremely well in the Arena of Legends. I'm afraid that the Floating Island of the Luo Clan won't be able to maintain its rank based on the points gained by Harold alone."</p>

  <p>The women discussed the rankings of the Floating Islands among themselves, pointing at the falling Floating Island of the Luo Clan. Most people thought that the Floating Island of the Luo Clan was a miracle. It had stood in the Time Sea without falling for so many years depending on a single person's points alone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's frown deepened when he heard the women's discussion.</p>

  <p>While his clothes flapped around in the strong wind, he stood rooted to the spot like a statue, staring closely at the Floating Island of the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>For some reason, he felt that this island was immensely important to him.</p>

  <p>He felt like if it fell into the Time Sea, he would forever lose something dear to him.</p>

  <p>However, something unexpected happened then. While the Floating Island of the Luo Clan descended to the second to the bottom, the Floating Island of the Zhou Clan rocked about and started to move down rapidly as well.</p>

  <p>"Look, the Floating Island of the Zhou Clan is also moving."</p>

  <p>"This time, the Zhou Clan didn't perform well. It is said that several powerful clans worked together to oppress them."</p>

  <p>"I wonder which clan will be ranked the last, the Zhou Clan or the Luo Clan."</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng stared at the rapid descent of the Zhou Clan's Floating Island, his eyes lit up and a glimmer of hope rose in his heart.</p>

  <p>Each island was a city-sized monster and thus moved at a painfully slow pace.</p>

  <p>Waiting for the end result felt like torture to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Floating Island of the Luo Clan trembled and stopped at the second floor from the bottom.</p>

  <p>The Floating Island of the Zhou Clan, on the other hand, continued descending before stopping at the 36th place. "The Zhou Clan is eliminated by the Hall of Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>"It seems that the Luo Clan's Floating Island has escaped yet another time."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm afraid that this time will be their last!"</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Luo Zheng didn't care about the women's words and heaved a deep sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Actually, the Luo Clan's Floating Island had been destroyed, and it was meaningless for a single bare island to stay on the Time Sea. However, there had to be a reason why Harold kept trying so hard to keep the island on the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had never stepped into that island, he felt an inexplicable connection with it. He didn't want it to fall into the sea.</p>

  <p>'In the future, I will definitely place this island above all the powerful clans, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>In fact, the senior leaders of all the powerful clans had already known the rankings of the islands, because each clan had a few people who were responsible for the calculation of the points on the last day.</p>

  <p>After the Floating Island of the Zhou Clan fell to the last place, the leaders finally informed its inhabitants to evacuate it.</p>

  <p>All the martial artists of the Zhou Clan felt sad.</p>

  <p>The Zhou Clan was actually one of the most powerful clans in the Time Sea. They had settled in the sea in the 340th divine era and recruited all the core disciples of their clan into the island.</p>

  <p>Those had been the Zhou Clan's glory days. Before the 180th divine era, they had ranked in the top five.</p>

  <p>Back then, they had never imagined that they would be forced to leave the Time Sea one day.</p>

  <p>Soon, countless Sun Blind members came by small boats and took all the disciples of the Zhou Clan away from the Time Sea. Luo Luo Zheng noticed that apart from the small boats, they also had huge ships that were hundreds of feet long.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race seemed to be extremely efficient at what they did.</p>

  <p>There were tens of thousands of small boats and large ships that were gathering from all directions. They looked like brown leaves that continuously floated over, carrying people away in constant streams.</p>

  <p>However, the population of the Zhou Clan's Floating Island was very large. Counting the Zhuo Clan's members as well as members of other clans, there were about seven to eight hundred thousand people. It was not easy to evacuate so many people from the island in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng looked down at the scene of the Zhou Clan members leaving the Time Sea, his eyes hardened. "The Floating Island of the Zhou Clan fell to the last place because it was oppressed by several powerful clans together. The Dongfang Clan and the Mu Clan supported the Xie Clan and the Liu Clan, and together, they oppressed the Zhou Clan. This time, the Luo Clan is not eliminated, but the Zhou Clan is directly being driven out of the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being of the Zhou Clan must hate the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>I wonder if it is possible to win over the Holy Beings who are eliminated from the Time Sea."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought hard, and then suddenly shook his head with a smile. His father's layout was scrupulous in all aspects, so he guessed that his father must have made arrangements for this outcome too. All of a sudden, he felt a lot less pessimistic.</p>

  <p>While the Zhou Clan was evacuating their Floating Island, the Floating Islands of the Xie Clan and the Liu Clan rose rapidly, surpassing other islands.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Xie Clan was ranked 17th while the Liu Clan was ranked 13th.</p>

  <p>"Well, the Xie Clan and the Liu Clan are the ones who made the best of their opportunities. As soon as they became rich and influential, they joined forces with the Dongfang Clan, and the Dongfang Clan naturally raised their rankings."</p>

  <p>"In the future, the Dongfang Clan may be able to control the Hall of Holy Beings."</p>

  <p>The female disciples of the Purple Soul Hall sighed in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The rankings of the 36 Floating Islands were constantly changing. This time, although the rankings had changed a lot, none of the changes had come as a surprise.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Luo Zheng felt a tremor under his feet.</p>

  <p>The entire Floating Island he was standing on began to slowly float upward.</p>

  <p>The Han Clan had ranked 10th among the Floating Islands, but now, it surpassed the Tang Clan, the Gu Clan, and the Fang Clan. At last, it was ranked 7th.</p>

  <p>The Gu Clan's Floating Island dropped sharply from the 8th rank.</p>

  <p>The Gu Clan had two consummate True Gods, Hallet and Augustus.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they had always had a great advantage when it came to points because they only had a few members. As such, the ranking of their Floating Island had always been stable. So now, its sudden drop in ranking caused a lot of exclamations of surprise from other clans.</p>

  <p>Only then did many people remember that Hallet and Augustus hadn't fought in the open battles for the rankings of the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>By the time all the Floating Islands were rearranged, the disciples of the Zhou Clan had left their Floating Island. Under everyone's gaze, the magnificent Floating Island of the Zhou Clan tilted slightly to the side and flew toward the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>The moment it touched the Time Sea, the magnificent sea seemed to turn into a ruthless giant beast that chewed the island into pieces and swallowed it up in the blink of an eye. Not even a single residue was left, and no waves were made.</p>

  <p>Standing on the boats of the Sun Blind race, the members of the Zhou Clan looked back, their faces filled with grief and reluctance.</p>
