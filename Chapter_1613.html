<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1613 Flame Bees </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment Janet jumped off the Lava Giant's head, the two Lava Giants collided violently with each other.</p>

  <p>As a loud bang resounded behind her, Janet jumped into the air and landed steadily on the Magnetic Sacred Mountain.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Luo Luo Zheng breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>Even though Janet had been in a critical situation, she had still chosen to take the risk of releasing the flame kitten first. So naturally, the other warriors had all been worried to death about her.</p>

  <p>If she had been just a little slower, she would have missed the chance to escape.</p>

  <p>"Move to the top of the mountain!"</p>

  <p>Just as Janet steadied herself on the mountain, she heard Luo Luo Zheng instructing them in a nervous voice.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the two Lava Giants both lost their balance from the force of the impact and crashed into the lava lake.</p>

  <p>Their huge bodies disrupted the lava in the lake, forming towering waves that were several hundred feet high and spread out quickly in all directions.</p>

  <p>"Move! Move!"</p>

  <p>"Hurry up!"</p>

  <p>Coleman was the first to move. Jeffrey, Hailey, and Janet followed closely behind him.</p>

  <p>However, they were still in great danger. If the lava overflowed from the lake and reached the mountain, they would have nowhere to run.</p>

  <p>Coleman, who always performed best in times of danger, quickly climbed up the mountain with the agility of an ape while continuously releasing the forceful energy within his body and soon arrived at the top of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain. From there, he leaped over a distance of three thousand feet and fell onto the other side of the lake.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>As soon as he landed on the shore, he immediately took to his heels. The waves of lava spread in all directions, not only toward the Magnetic Sacred Mountain but also toward the shore.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who had originally been standing on the shore, had no choice but to retreat in order to avoid the waves of lava.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Janet and the rest had lost the chance to jump to the shore.</p>

  <p>Now that the waves of lava had flooded the shore, they would most probably plunge headfirst into the lava if they tried to jump now.</p>

  <p>Their only option right now was to stay on the summit of the Magnetic Sacred Mountain and wait for the waves to withdraw back into the lake.</p>

  <p>Their pulses raced as the splash approached and the waves of lava surged along the mountainside.</p>

  <p>Their faces darkened as they helplessly watched the waves getting closer and closer.</p>

  <p>They were already at the very top of the mountain. If the waves of lava came up to them, they would have nowhere to escape to.</p>

  <p>150 feet...</p>

  <p>100 feet...</p>

  <p>50 feet...</p>

  <p>Huddling at the mountaintop, they watched in horror as the lava surged quickly toward them.</p>

  <p>Finally, when it was only 10 feet away from the top of the mountain, the lava stopped. Like the tide going out, the surface of the lava gradually fell lower and lower.</p>

  <p>"We made it through somehow." Janet sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>They all looked a lot more relaxed now that they were out of the danger zone.</p>

  <p>Waves of lava continued to be stirred up by the battle between the two Lava Giants, but they never surpassed the first wave.</p>

  <p>Janet and the others waited until the lava retreated from the shore before they jumped off the mountain and finally reached the other side of the lake.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng waved his hand at the Magnetic Sacred Mountain, and it began to slowly spin in the lava and shrink at the same time. In the blink of an eye, it turned into a fist-sized miniature mountain and returned to his hand.</p>

  <p>"Does this mean that we've passed the fourth Hall of Causality successfully?" Janet asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>She was the kind of person who would never admit defeat.</p>

  <p>In her previous Hall of Causality challenge, she had teamed up with two ace talents.</p>

  <p>But in the end, all her team members had failed to pass the fourth Hall of Causality except the two ace talents, not because of their weakness but because of the incompatibility of the ace talents.</p>

  <p>Instead of putting their heads together and helping the rest of the team members, the two ace talents had kept fighting along the way.</p>

  <p>Luckily, this time, the team had managed to survive the four Halls of Causality with only four members as a sacrifice. It was a satisfactory outcome.</p>

  <p>Now that they had passed through the lava lake, they decided to continue forward without any rest. If their previous experience was any indication, they would receive considerable rewards for passing through this Hall of Causality on the way ahead.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to leave, a cluster of flames suddenly rose from the edge of the lava lake and turned into a flame kitten, which padded onto the shore.</p>

  <p>"Meow!"</p>

  <p>The little kitten let out a soft cry.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at the little creature and noticed that its fur was lackluster. He murmured with surprise, "Wait a second. This flame kitten..." He turned to Janet and said, "It seems to be the one you released just moments ago."</p>

  <p>After looking at it carefully, Janet recognized it too. Although every flame kitten looked pretty much the same, this one had been around them for quite a while, so she managed to recognize it from a few details.</p>

  <p>"What is it trying to do?" She stared at the little flame kitten with a curious look on her face.</p>

  <p>The flame kitten slowly crawled toward Janet after it came ashore. It didn't show any signs of enmity; instead, it showed a desire to stay close to her.</p>

  <p>"You... You want to come with me?" she asked, continuing to watch the kitten.</p>

  <p>"Meow!" the little kitten replied innocently. Its cuteness touched the girl's heart.</p>

  <p>"The Illusion Battlefield is an illusionary world, so I'm afraid I can't take you out of this world. But maybe I can at least take you out of the Hall of Causality, right?" With that, she reached out toward the little flame kitten.</p>

  <p>The power of the Fire Law contained within this little flame kitten was pure and strong, but Janet didn't feel the burn at all as she held the kitten up in her arms. Instead, she felt warmth and fluff.</p>

  <p>"This fellow... It really wants to come with you," Jeffrey commented with a surprised look on his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled. "The flame kittens in the lava lake are the food of the Lava Giants. I presume that there are even stronger creatures in the depths of the lake. This poor kitten doesn't want to stay in such a fatal environment."</p>

  <p>Janet held the little flame kitten in her arms with a soft smile on her face.</p>

  <p>"Then let me take care of it for some time!"</p>

  <p>She decided to keep this creature as a pet.</p>

  <p>They then proceeded deeper into the cave. But very soon, they saw countless specks of light floating toward them from ahead.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng heard the strange sound and saw the red specks of light, his eyes narrowed in comprehension. "The flame bees," he surmised.</p>

  <p>"I knew that it wouldn't be so easy to pass the fourth Hall of Causality!"</p>

  <p>Coleman cried out. He quickly stepped back and hid behind the others.</p>

  <p>The swarm of flame bees fluttered over in great numbers. It seemed that soon, the swarm would surround them all.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng flicked his finger to summon a wind blade and ordered it to slash the bees.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the flame bees weren't difficult to deal with at all. His wind blade easily cut through one of them.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a large mass of Illusion Points burst out from within the flame bee's body.</p>

  <p>After that, these Illusion Points rushed toward Luo Luo Zheng and flowed into his body.</p>

  <p>"What? This is..." Luo Luo Zheng was taken aback.</p>

  <p>He exchanged glances with the others, and they shouted out simultaneously, "The reward!"</p>

  <p>They now understood that the flame bees that were flying in front of them were actually the reward for passing the fourth Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>The flame bee that had been killed by Luo Luo Zheng had contained ten thousand Illusion Points within it, so the large swarm of bees now meant a huge number of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>The faces of all the team members beamed with excitement.</p>

  <p>Even Coleman, who had been hiding behind them, immediately rushed toward the bees when he heard the truth.</p>

  <p>Everyone followed Luo Zheng's lead and used different methods to kill as many flame bees as possible.</p>

  <p>These flame bees were indeed the reward for passing this Hall of Causality. Although they swarmed over everyone like a cloud, they didn't show any intention of attacking but rather simply floated around in the air and allowed themselves to be killed by the warriors. Although they were extremely simple to kill, they contained an immense number of Illusion Points? over ten thousand Illusion Points each! That meant that by killing one thousand bees, a warrior could acquire more than ten million Illusion Points!</p>

  <p>Although it was very difficult to pass through the Hall of Causality, the reward for the winners was extremely great.</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Luo Zheng killed about 800 flame bees and obtained over eight million Illusion Points, so his gain here was actually less than what he had obtained in the second Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>Of course, this was an unfair comparison. In the second Hall of Causality, most warriors could only get one or two million Illusion Points, while those with more powerful strength could get three or four million. Luo Luo Zheng, who had obtained ten million Illusion Points there, was undoubtedly an exception.</p>

  <p>Here, besides Luo Luo Zheng, the other warriors also had good harvests. Janet killed more than 700 flame bees, while Jeffrey and the rest killed an average of 600 bees each.</p>

  <p>After receiving the rewards, they continued on their journey. They passed through the hall and continued to climb up the mountain.</p>

  <p>Janet had said that there were five tests in total in the Hall of Causality, but this was only her deduction. She didn't know what would actually be waiting for them at the peak of the mountain. Still, everyone was looking forward to it and moved at their full speed. After all, this was probably the last test they would take in the Hall of Causality.</p>
