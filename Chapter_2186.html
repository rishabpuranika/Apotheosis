  <p>The moment Luo Luo Zheng took a few steps forward, he suddenly heard a set of loud footsteps behind him. It was Seth, who was ranked third.</p>

  <p>The third-placer's face was full of doubt as he scanned Luo Zheng's calm face, despite Zane being ahead of him.</p>

  <p>When he passed by Luo Luo Zheng, both of them looked at each other. He smiled politely at Luo Luo Zheng and then quickly left.</p>

  <p>He was known as a steady and sensible man. He didn't have much of an opinion on Luo Luo Zheng, but he knew not to provoke the other warrior. At the very least, he had to act courteous even on just the surface. Furthermore, they had to rely on only themselves in the Consulting God Hall. It was also why he didn't need to remind Luo Luo Zheng the way Zane did.</p>

  <p>After all of the warriors entered the Consulting God Hall, they were led to a small downward slope. Luo Luo Zheng moved neither fast nor slow, so other proving godly warriors who were ranked a bit lower than him surpassed him one by one.</p>

  <p>Those proving godly warriors were the elites of the great clans, but they didn't dare to offend Luo Luo Zheng either when they passed by him. They secretly mocked Luo Luo Zheng and his slow, leisurely pace in their minds, but they didn't say anything. They thought that he had wasted his advantage, even though he had won first place.</p>

  <p>"The Heavenly Han House has inherited the Han Clan's heritage, so it is impossible to even underestimate it.</p>

  <p>Sadly, it's a pity that because the Han Clan doesn't manage its sub-branches well, they haven't accomplished anything in years," Master Evil lamented while Luo Luo Zheng looked around the Consulting God Hall.</p>

  <p>The hall had been built a long time ago, but the carvings on the walls were still as impressive as ever. They were grand and majestic, decorated with all kinds of legends. There were patterns of the immortal birds constructing a rainbow bridge, and the Creating Axe used to separate the heaven from earth.</p>

  <p>"When someone of the Han Clan becomes a Holy Being, they will surely transfer all the outstanding warriors of their family to the Floating Island, and only the sub-branches will be left. What can the sub-branches accomplish then?" Luo Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"The Han Clan doesn't care about its sub-branches. I've once traveled to the ancestral lands of other great clans in the divine land, and found that they're in a much better situation than the Han Clan."</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, some of the ancestral lands were still under the care of their clans. In some cases, with the accumulations of ancestral lands, their members could become Holy Beings. However, the Han Clan didn't think the same. They looked down on the proving godly warriors who took part in the test of the Heavenly Han House, and even Master Evil.</p>

  <p>"Look at how the owner of the Heavenly Han House treats you," Master Evil continued. "You're like a life-saving straw to him." "It looks like it won't be long. They won't even wait until you master the Divine Dao before they hurriedly recommend you to the Floating Island," he added.</p>

  <p>Although Master Evil hadn't actually spoken much, he had thoroughly observed the people outside from Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>The two of them chatted as they walked down the long slope all the way to the bottom. It was still pitch black in the distance, and only a few glimmers that barely pointed out the path floated around. However, there was a horizontal line that was outlined by a row of cyan bricks in the middle of the path.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng crossed the bricks, he felt a very complex Mu Ning rush towards him from all directions.</p>

  <p>"This is a vibe, and also the internal momentum?" Luo Luo Zheng muttered. The corners of his eyes twitched in realization.</p>

  <p>Momentum was a description of a True God's ability to summon the Faith Energy within their inner world. On the other hand, one's comprehension of it was called the internal momentum.</p>

  <p>For instance, Luo Luo Zheng had created a large sword cloud from that patch of mud. The momentum contained within that sword cloud could be called internal momentum.</p>

  <p>It was known that in the divine land, the Godly Tablets that recorded the Divine Dao boasted of the purest internal momentum. However, the Divine Dao Tablets in the Consulting God Hall were created by the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Luo Luo Zheng didn't take what Malloy said seriously since all of the Divine Dao Tablets in the Consulting God Halls were imitations. The internal momentum of the imitations, which the warriors had comprehended was slightly different from that of the original Divine Dao Tablets. It was clearly much more inferior.</p>

  <p>Yet after Luo Luo Zheng crossed the line and was bathed in the momentum, the sliver of contempt he had originally harbored disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>It was no accident that the Han Clan would have a Holy Being. This was the accumulation that a great clan should have. Moreover, they had accumulated a lot more, so they should even have a second or a third Holy Being. Unfortunately, the Han Clan's sub-branches did not have any Holy Beings. What was worse was that in the last few thousand years, the sub-branches never contributed even a single disciple for Holy Emperor. That was the reason why Master Evil felt that the Han Clan's sub-branches had declined.</p>

  <p>The internal momentum that had been placed on Luo Zheng's body was extremely complicated, as it was an Mu Ning formed from many kinds of internal momentum.</p>

  <p>The momentum grew increasingly stronger as Luo Luo Zheng progressed. However, it didn't obstruct him too much and he was able to maintain a pace that was neither too fast, nor too slow.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, many more proving godly warriors had surpassed him.</p>

  <p>When they saw how slow Luo Luo Zheng walked, they all thought that Luo Zheng's soul was so weak that he couldn't resist the momentum. Some of them even showed off to him by obviously quickening their paces.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng understood what they thought. His faint smile remained on his face. The test of the Heavenly Han House was tough, as seen in the competitiveness among the contestants, who all did their best in hopes of gaining the favor of the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was no longer on the same level as them, and what they fought over meant nothing to him.</p>

  <p>After about five minutes, the momentum had increased tenfold from before. Then, a huge hall appeared in front of Luo Luo Zheng--it was the real Consulting God Hall.</p>

  <p>Gigantic Divine Dao Tablets which had faint words that flowed on them lined the ground. Each of them emitted varying degrees of radiance and luster. They also had unique appearances and forms of words. Some of them were like grass serpents that coiled around, while others were carved by nicking and pitching tools. It was clear that those Divine Dao Tablets weren't created by the same person.</p>

  <p>Underneath each of the Divine Dao Tablets was a narrow flight of stairs that was paved like a small mountain slope. Shadows from the huge, towering Divine Dao Tablets shaded the tight path.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had seen many strange things in his life, he was still quite shocked when he saw the scene in front of him.</p>

  <p>"It's truly amazing to see imitated Divine Dao Tablets. I wonder what a true one is like," Luo Luo Zheng said as his eyes lit up. Ever since he entered the divine land, he had yet to personally see a true Divine Dao Tablet.</p>

  <p>He continued his slow pace as he moved forward in the place.</p>

  <p>All the proving godly warriors who had surpassed him now walked slower. Some of them were drenched in sweat as white fog came out of their heads.</p>

  <p>They were already considered as outstanding warriors in the Heavenly Han House. About one hundred proving godly warriors had just surpassed Luo Luo Zheng, and they were among the top one hundred.</p>

  <p>However, they still found it difficult to resist the internal momentum despite being only a small distance away from the Divine Dao Tablets.</p>

  <p>Only Luo Luo Zheng seemed to stroll leisurely in his courtyard. His lips were still curved up in a smile as he passed the proving godly warriors. Those who had mocked him before now understood that it wasn't that he couldn't walk fast, but he simply did not want to compete with them.</p>

  <p>According to Malloy, there were a total of 327 imitations of Divine Dao Tablets in the Consulting God Hall.</p>

  <p>Now, the Divine Dao Tablets were constructed in their current location not to allow them to comprehend the internal momentum contained within them. Many proving godly warriors had observed the Divine Dao Tablets for a hundred years, but might not be able to comprehend the internal momentum. Therefore, any proving godly warrior who was acknowledged by the imitations of Divine Dao Tablets could join the Heavenly Han House.</p>

  <p>Such a request seemed simple, but only a few people could actually do it.</p>

  <p>A maximum of twenty people succeeded every year. The Heavenly Han House had conducted a big test this year, so it might be more than twenty people--but it was not expected to exceed thirty.</p>

  <p>"This is the tablet of the Five Elements Divine Dao," Luo Luo Zheng said. He stepped forward and looked up at the first Divine Dao Tablet in awe.</p>

  <p>Just as he looked at it, he felt a strong sense of internal momentum of five elements from the tablet.</p>

  <p>The Five Elements Divine Dao was one of the most widely cultivated Divine Dao in the divine land. Many proving godly warriors had already begun to climb up the stairs, and the higher they climbed, the stronger the pressure of internal momentum they faced. Currently, there were more than a dozen warriors on the stairs. All of them climbed upwards slowly and silently in order to obtain a better position.</p>

  <p>However, the quietness was disturbed when someone shouted, "Get out of my way!"</p>

  <p>The voice came from a warrior who pushed another warrior in his way.</p>

  <p>The steps were extremely narrow and could only accommodate one person. When everyone had reached their limits, they all had to fight for the same position. Thus, it was no surprise when a dispute arose.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng saw the scene, he only shook his head and continued to walk forward. He wasn't too interested in the Five Elements Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Besides, it wasn't easy to travel to the place, so he wanted to see the other Divine Dao Tablets.</p>
