<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3722 Dreaded Eyes </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Each time the gates to the Soul City were closed, the souls imprisoned in the walls and the earth would emerge in a bloodthirsty haze.</p>

  <p>Because they had no consciousness, their only instinct was to constantly devour or be devoured. There were no winners here.</p>

  <p>Even the most powerful of souls would eventually exhaust its energy, and turn into a mindless zombie till it sank back into the earth and became a part of the Soul City.</p>

  <p>After a while, they would be born once more, and began to devour other souls to grow more powerful, until they sank back into the earth, and so on.</p>

  <p>The cycle was never ending.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light from the Source World often waited outside the Soul City. From the gates, they could hear all kinds of howls and shrieks coming from within the Soul City.</p>

  <p>The Soul City was not home to Souls of Light nor the Other Shore creatures. It was home to these resentful souls.</p>

  <p>Now that the door was closed and all the Souls of Light were locked inside, it was not hard to imagine how things would turn out for them.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, huddle!"</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue reacted quickly and ordered with a trace of anxiety in her voice.</p>

  <p>In a situation this chaotic, if they tried to fight on their own, it was only a matter of time before they all died. Now, they needed to band closely together.</p>

  <p>Obediently, the other Souls of Light moved closer to her. Even Dailey from the Bearing race, who was initially hostile towards her, huddled towards the others.</p>

  <p>Just as everyone gathered around Li Bianxue, a dragon-shaped soul rushed towards them from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Soul-shattering Strike!" Li Bianxue cried.</p>

  <p>The moment she saw the dragon-shaped soul headed straight for them, she knew how powerful it was. Without hesitation, she launched her strongest soul attack.</p>

  <p>Raising her hand to the sky, countless soul swords shot upwards, one after the other.</p>

  <p>"Puff, puff, puff..."</p>

  <p>The Soul-shattering Strike was indeed powerful. If it was any other Soul of Light, it'd have been beaten to a pulp by now.</p>

  <p>However, when the swords hit the surface the dragon-shaped soul, the energy actually bounced off and disappeared into thin air.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue's face fell. Trembling slightly, she felt an incredible need to run away.</p>

  <p>However, the dragon-shaped soul was extremely fast. It bared its menacing teeth at Li Bianxue, poised to bite her head off.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue froze. As panic welled within her, she silently resigned herself to her fate.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to shut her eyes tight, a figure flashed in front of her.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Under such a violent collision, the dragon-shaped soul was smashed into pieces. Its head writhed and wriggled on the ground before them.</p>

  <p>However, when the other souls saw the mangled dragon-shaped soul, they had flocked over it and devoured it violently. In no time, there was nothing left of it.</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge..." Li Bianxue looked at the figure in front of her gratefully.</p>

  <p>In her eyes, these princes, princesses, as well as the children of the leaders of the mountains, were not even worth much thought. Even if these people were talented, Li Bianxue always thought they were too unruly and arrogant and they couldn't achieve anything extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Yet now, she felt indebted to Feng Ge. She had forgotten that Feng Ge had a physical body here!</p>

  <p>"Get up," Feng Ge said indifferently. "Follow closely behind me."</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue nodded slightly and stood obediently behind Feng Ge. Now was not the time to feign bravery.</p>

  <p>When Zhu Ge Feng, Carver, and other disciples from the third floor of the Land of Sword Grief realized how strong Feng Ge was, they too rushed to her side.</p>

  <p>They thought they might have a better chance of making out of this alive if they stayed close to her.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>Just then, a golden fish-shaped soul lurked nearby, swimming across the ground as though it were water. Ominously, it swam beneath everyone's feet, taunting them almost.</p>

  <p>This fish-shaped soul had had a taste of the Souls of Light before. How could it give up this delicious opportunity so easily?</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>After locking onto its target, the fish-shaped soul suddenly jumped up from the ground, like a salmon leaping gracefully into the air from a river.</p>

  <p>Opening its bloody mouth, it swallowed up three Souls of Light that were nearest to it in one gulp. Then, it hid under the ground once more.</p>

  <p>It wandered along the ground until it reached the walls of a building in the Soul City. As it swam around, digesting its most recent prey, it eyed the Souls of Light beside the soul pillars.</p>

  <p>The big fish was not the only hunter here. Countless golden souls rushed out from the soul cloud, hungry for soul food. Each hunter could live for a very long time, and their strength could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Despite chances of survival looking quite slim, the Souls of Light continued to launch their counterattacks. Except for Dailey who had reached the Holy Soul Realm, the other warriors, including Toby of the Separate Abyss race didn't have the ability to fight back. Consequently, the air was filled with their screams.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Step back behind Dailey!"</p>

  <p>"Princess Feng Ge from the Taiyi Heaven Palace has a physical body. She can protect us!"</p>

  <p>Gradually, those Souls of Light gathered behind the two of them.</p>

  <p>However, those light golden souls were not willing to give up. They wandered in the ground and observed carefully. As long as there was a chance, they would jump up, tear up a Soul of Light, swallow it into their mouths, and then dive into the ground...</p>

  <p>In the cabin, from the small window, Luo Zheng could see the chaos taking place outside. His expression darkened.</p>

  <p>All these strange things started happening only after the golden pot fell to the ground, extinguishing the flame.</p>

  <p>It didn't take a genius to figure out the cause and effect.</p>

  <p>The Soul City would open every 132 hours. When it opened, the window of the cabin would be illuminated. Evidently, this was thanks to the flame of the golden pot.</p>

  <p>In other words, every 132 hours, the golden pot would automatically light up with a flame--or, someone lit it every 132 hours.</p>

  <p>Once the flame was ignited, the doors to the Soul City would open.</p>

  <p>Then, 132 hours later, the flame of the golden pot would be extinguished, closing the gates to the Soul City.</p>

  <p>Now that the flame was extinguished by Luo Zheng, the door closed in advance!</p>

  <p>Just seconds after flame was extinguished, the Soul City was already in chaos. Luo Zheng needed to ignite the flame again somehow.</p>

  <p>"Flame..."</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was in the form of his physical body, he could use the Elementary Fire Divine Dao to easily release flames.</p>

  <p>But in this situation, where could he possibly find a fire?</p>

  <p>Anxiously, he racked his brains trying to come up with a solution.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he turned to the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "Is Master Zhurong able to..."</p>

  <p>Before he could even finish speaking, the Primeval Lord of Heaven replied.</p>

  <p>"If Zhurong can make a move, I can also release flames to help you ignite the golden pot. But you have forgotten what form you are in now."</p>

  <p>The Civilization Artifacts were borne by Luo Zheng's inner world, turning into a strange form. When Luo Zheng entered the Other Shore with his physical body, he could release them from his inner world.</p>

  <p>However, when he was in the form of Soul of Light, he couldn't use any Divine Dao. Consequently, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others wouldn't be able to help much.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's frown deepened and he turned to stare outside the window again.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a streak of golden lightning flashed across the soul cloud.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Two huge dark blue eyes emerged from the depths of the soul cloud.</p>
