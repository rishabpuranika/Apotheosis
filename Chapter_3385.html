<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3385 Fighting </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Metallic clangs filled the air as the sharp, golden swords continued to fall down and erode the rocks above the cave.</p>

  <p>There was a dull crack when the rocks had been eroded to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the whole rock layer collapsed to the bottom of the cave and covered its surface.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>In turn, Luo Zheng, Sally, Chaim, and the Moon Spirit man all retreated to the edge of the cave to avoid being hit by the collapsed rocks.</p>

  <p>If they did get hit by the rocks, they wouldn't get hurt because of their strengths. If they exposed themselves, however, it would not end well.</p>

  <p>After all the rocks of the cave collapsed, a big pit was formed.</p>

  <p>Lesly and Brylee slowly descended.</p>

  <p>Their wings, which contained the divine flames of the Jin Wu, flapped and fanned the fire around them. Hot air surged around the pit.</p>

  <p>"What... are you doing?" the man from the Moon Spirit race said in a shaky voice.</p>

  <p>He instinctively leaned to the side, his face full of fear.</p>

  <p>Although he had avoided the disaster just now, the deaths of the two men from the Celestial Wolf race and the Lofty Mountain race still shook him to the core.</p>

  <p>Then again, the fights in the Chaotic Source World had always been quite cruel.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of warriors fought for the two hundred thousand Chaotic Source Spirits. If they continued to kill each other mercilessly, there would be less and less competitors in no time.</p>

  <p>According to the records, members of the same race who entered the Chaotic Source World would gather together as soon as possible and kill everyone else from the other races.</p>

  <p>The majority of the people who survived were the members and disciples of the super forces. Meanwhile, many elites who were trained by many small races usually died from unknown reasons.</p>

  <p>Although it was bloody and chaotic, it was a great test for the small races' members to succeed in undergoing the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. The risks they had to take were far greater than those of the members of the super forces.</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the Moon Spirit warrior was eager to get the Chaotic Source Spirits. Now, his hopes were crushed when he ended up in such a terrible situation.</p>

  <p>Lesly glanced at him and didn't show any changes in her expression.</p>

  <p>In her eyes, the man from the Moon Spirit race would become a hindrance to her if he stayed there?</p>

  <p>She gently pointed to the Moon Spirit warrior with her index finger. A golden strip of light burst from her fingertip and transformed into numerous golden fire birds, which charged straight towards the man.</p>

  <p>The man from the Moon Spirit race quickly turned around and jumped up when he saw the birds flying towards him, in an attempt to escape.</p>

  <p>As the golden fire birds neared further, he patted his head. Then a layer of light film spread out and shrouded the golden fire birds. The birds instantly slowed down.</p>

  <p>"Little tricks..." Lesly whispered with disdain.</p>

  <p>Then, she tugged her finger and lightly pulled the Moon Spirit warrior.</p>

  <p>It was as if an invisible thin thread had wrapped around the Moon Spirit warrior's legs and dragged him down, until he landed in the group of fire birds.</p>

  <p>"Ahhhhhhhhh!"</p>

  <p>The scream of the man from the Moon Spirit race only lasted for about two seconds until it suddenly stopped. Eventually, he was burned to death.</p>

  <p>As soon as he died, Lesly turned around and fixed her eyes on Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>To be honest, the calmness of Luo Zheng's face displeased her a little.</p>

  <p>After all, the more composed the opponent was, the more difficult they would be to deal with. "You are not nervous, right?" Lesly asked.</p>

  <p>There was a short silence while Luo Zheng observed the two demon women, and then he said with a smile, "I have fought Phoenix from the Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>You are just two demon women from the Divine Lair as well, so why should I be flustered?"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his words, Brylee's and Lesly's lips curved down to a frown.</p>

  <p>Even the talents of the Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race would still feel a lot of pressure when faced against them. Since there were two of them right now, surely they would get the upper hand during the fight.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng seemed to be a calm and prudent man, he was just as arrogant as the young man in black.</p>

  <p>"You are an arrogant man," Brylee coldly said.</p>

  <p>"The one you fought before was only Master Phoenix's Illusory Projection.</p>

  <p>She did not use all of her strength," Lesly calmly added.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Zheng's expression didn't change at all. In fact, he simply stared at the two demon women with a sinister grin on his face.</p>

  <p>The state of mind was very important during a life and death battle.</p>

  <p>Now that Lesly had started to give an explanation about that issue, it meant that she was having difficulty with their situation.</p>

  <p>In addition, it was actually true that there had been a huge uproar in the Divine Lair when Phoenix's Illusory Projection failed to catch Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was able to escape from Phoenix for two reasons: first, he wasn't afraid of the divine flames of the Jin Wu; second, he had relied on the Latent Theurgies of the Nine Li race. The latter was crucial, because without it, he wouldn't have been able to hold on until Qiu Yinhe's arrival.</p>

  <p>Of course, at that time Luo Zheng had no idea that Qiu Yinhe was observing him in secret.</p>

  <p>Anyway, it was a fact that Luo Zheng, who had just reached the Other Shore Realm, was able to escape from Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's intense stare towards Lesly and Brylee made the two demon women uneasy.</p>

  <p>Since they couldn't win an advantage when it came to their argument, they didn't want to say anything else.</p>

  <p>"Brylee, kill the two disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace. I will deal with this guy," Lesly said decisively.</p>

  <p>When Sally and Chaim, who both stood at the corner, heard her words, they couldn't help but feel a bit nervous.</p>

  <p>If Chaim was in his best condition, he wouldn't be afraid of the demon women of the Divine Lair. He could even escape if he ever fought against Brylee and Lesly.</p>

  <p>However, he hadn't completely recovered after he used the Living Puppet Chains. Thus, he might not be able to resist them.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Sally looked even more nervous now. She gently cupped her hands, and the Iridescent Stone appeared in her palms.</p>

  <p>If there was no way to dodge, she could only put up a desperate fight.</p>

  <p>"Splash!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of heat, Brylee rushed towards Sally and Chaim.</p>

  <p>Sally looked very weak, and she was always the one the other members of the Nine Li race had to protect.</p>

  <p>At that moment, however, she surprised everyone with her performance, which was even beyond Luo Zheng's and Chaim's imaginations.</p>

  <p>After she gently tossed the Iridescent Stone, it drew a colorful beam of light and shot towards Brylee.</p>

  <p>Brylee's eyes were filled with contempt when she saw that the Iridescent Stone had flown towards her. In return, her wings fluttered and cast a shadow in the air. The Iridescent Stone passed through the shadow, but it was impossible for it to touch Brylee.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Then, Brylee gently flipped her hand and a golden spear appeared. The condensed golden flame at the tip of the spear burned so hot that it could almost melt everything.</p>

  <p>Just as Brylee rushed downwards, she heard an unmistakable roar.</p>

  <p>Her heart pounded in her ribcage. That seemingly powerful sound frightened her.</p>

  <p>She instinctively lowered her head, but the Iridescent Stone, which had just returned, passed by and smashed her ear, making it bleed!</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>"Click!"</p>

  <p>The Iridescent Stone finally flew back to the hand of Sally, who looked at Brylee with a serious face. "Don't get closer to me... Otherwise I will attack you!" she warned.</p>

  <p>Chaim had witnessed the whole thing from a distance. He looked at Sally and said encouragingly, "Well done, Sally!"</p>

  <p>The Iridescent Stone seemed to be quite an ordinary descending type of Other Shore Token, but it was mysterious and useful, with many functions.</p>

  <p>The Iridescent Stone was extremely flexible and was under Sally's complete control. Whenever she threw it away, it always returned to her.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, she could even activate the Other Shore Power within the stone, which could enhance its speed and release more power.</p>

  <p>Once the stone was triggered, its impact force could easily reach one thousand Jun. The only catch was that she could only activate the Iridescent Stone for three times within a day. After that, the Iridescent Stone could not be used again.</p>

  <p>Before, Brylee had noticed that Chaim looked weak and Sally didn't seem powerful at all, so she had always looked down on them.</p>

  <p>Her mindset caused her to treat them with such contempt and because she was too confident, she hadn't been careful enough, which almost cost her life.</p>

  <p>Had the power of one thousand megatons landed squarely on her head, it would have surely smashed it into pieces.</p>
