<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 258 The Seven Mysterious Demon Swords (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>The arrogant words of Zheng had enraged Fren to a point where he saw red everywhere.</p>

  <p>Just then, everyone heard an abrupt sound of something soaring at incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>From the side of the door, a thin willow leaf dart shot towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>As soon as he became aware of it, Zheng calmly stretched out his hand and pushed the willow leaf dart away in a gentle manner.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a charming woman entered through the door and yelled,</p>

  <p>"Fren, kill him!"</p>

  <p>Upon closer look, it turned out that the woman was someone named Vivan, whom Zheng had met at the Zhang Clan's Blessed Auction House in the past.</p>

  <p>Seeing his woman had already made her move, Fren felt convinced that he did not have to wait any longer. Instantly, his hand glowed with an orange light, forming a big sword.</p>

  <p>It was the Seven Mysterious Demon Swords, the Zhuge Clan's tier 4 cultivation method. After he had tossed it casually, the orange-red sword hung in the air while facing Zheng.</p>

  <p>It strangely appeared as though there was an invisible man, and he was holding the sword.</p>

  <p>Then, the number of swords multiplied from one to several, as though someone had replicated the original sword many times.</p>

  <p>The orange light in Fren's hand flickered unceasingly; one after another, big swords appeared from each flash.</p>

  <p>In the end, there were seven swords in the air, with seemingly seven invisible swordsmen holding them.</p>

  <p>"Kill him, now!" commanded Fren.</p>

  <p>Raising their swords, the seven invisible swordsmen rushed towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Some went to stab him horizontally while others cut him vertically. The seven invisible swordsmen united their efforts to ensure his defeat and marched from every possible direction to corner him.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Vivan threw the willow leaf darts, flicking them at the speed of light at Zheng one after another.</p>

  <p>Seizing the opportunity, Murry sprang to attack Zheng from behind. As he had taken numerous advantage of the Zhuge Clan, it was only natural for him to help Fren. While holding his judge's brush pen and using the life vitality as his ink, he wrote a big word in mid-air.</p>

  <p>"SEAL!"</p>

  <p>After Murry finished writing, the word 'SEAL' launched towards Zheng in an instant.</p>

  <p>As soon as the word had reached him, his demonic life vitality vanished all at once.</p>

  <p>"What I have just done sealed off your life vitality. Let's see what you can do against it," Murry boasted smugly.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his cocky words, instead of panicking, Zheng thought calmly,</p>

  <p>'Since it can seal off the life vitality, perhaps it is a kind of enchanted barrier. That would mean the Emerald Crystal in my arm might work on it.'</p>

  <p>"Bah! It's just an insignificant trick to me!"</p>

  <p>After saying that, Zheng raised his left hand slowly. With his head held high, he hit the giant word using his fist.</p>

  <p>"It's no use trying to break my 'SEAL' with brute force alone," said Murry, shaking his head. Then he scorned disapprovingly, "You must be dreaming if you think that's all it'll take."</p>

  <p>However, to his surprise, blood red energy gushed out from Zheng's fist when it touched his 'SEAL' word and ultimately tainted it.</p>

  <p>In a second, red cracks like a spider's web appeared on the word.</p>

  <p>Then a strange cracking sound followed, which made Murry's eyes widen in shock.</p>

  <p>His 'SEAL' enchanted barrier broke to pieces after Zheng's single blow, and then it vanished into the air without much of a resistance.</p>

  <p>After throwing a sarcastic look in Murry's direction, Zheng deflected a series of willow leaf darts that Vivan had thrown at him. Murry could not help but remain speechless.</p>

  <p>Since Vivan was not that strong, Zheng did not worry about the willow leaf darts. Even if any of her attempts had managed to strike him, it could hardly cause any trouble.</p>

  <p>In Zheng's opinion, the real threat was Fren's seven swords, as they looked rather powerful.</p>

  <p>These seven swords were from a tier 4 cultivation method, which could indicate something was likely unique about them.</p>

  <p>Since it seemed as though seven invisible swordsmen controlled a sword each, dodging all the attacks was going to be quite a headache.</p>

  <p>Even if he could easily deflect the swords, how would he destroy swordsmen who did not actually exist?</p>

  <p>To other people, such a troublesome question might render them nervous --- but not Zheng. Soon, he thought of a strategy on how to deal with the seven swords.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Carrying a powerful gust of wind, an invisible swordsman went for Zheng's head with his sword.</p>

  <p>Contrary to Fren's expectation, Zheng did not dodge his attack. In fact, he did not even look like he was going to counter the attack. Instead, in what could only be the simplest way possible, Zheng reached out directly with his hand to catch the sword.</p>

  <p>Thud!</p>

  <p>With a playful grin, Zheng gripped the hilt of the sword effortlessly, and then he pointed it at Fren. A taunting glint appeared in his eyes as he watched the priceless reaction on Fren's face.</p>

  <p>Hiding the shock behind a brave facade, Fren narrowed his eyes and said, "It's good that you can catch a sword. Unfortunately, you only have two hands. I don't know how you catch the other six swords."</p>

  <p>Under Fren's command, the other six swords launched a siege on Zheng from different directions.</p>

  <p>"Take it easy, you just wait and see!" Zheng replied humorously. The demonic life vitality surged out of his hand and seeped into the sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>In a moment, the color of the sword changed from orange to purple-black. Upon seeing the transformation, Zheng let out a satisfied sigh.</p>

  <p>Reassured by the familiar color, he let go of the sword. This time, however, he had taken full control of it.</p>

  <p>As Zheng signaled, the purple-black sword followed his every intention and hovered in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Bang bang bang!"</p>

  <p>The other six orange swords clashed with the purple-black sword one after another, as Zheng maneuvered it expertly and blocked each fierce attack.</p>

  <p>The color of Fren's face drastically changed while he watched the unbelievable scene before his eyes. Never in his dreams did he imagine that someone, let alone Zheng, could take away one of his swords. On top of that, the man had total power over it now.</p>
