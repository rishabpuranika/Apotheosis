<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3208 Unexpected Fear </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Warrior of the Stone Hill was ten times bigger than an ordinary person, which was why it had such a large palm.</p>

  <p>The huge palm pressed down, distinctly contrasting with Luo Zheng's black fist.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gave his all to extract his strength to the fullest.</p>

  <p>He channeled most of the Shade Stone liquid into his right arm, leaving only a small part to converge in his spine.</p>

  <p>He was afraid that his spine wouldn't be able to bear such a strong impact and crash.</p>

  <p>Flamine's eyes were sparkling with a golden brilliance, the radiance of the divine flames of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Logic dictated that she should stop the fight right this moment.</p>

  <p>She rarely left the Phoenix Palace and she didn't know Luo Zheng, but her keen eyes allowed her to minutely observe Luo Zheng's potential.</p>

  <p>She assumed that such talent might be greatly valued in the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>If he died in the Phoenix Palace, the Phoenix Palace could never explain themselves to the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>But as she looked at Luo Zheng's powerful momentum, Flamine had a premonition that Luo Zheng would probably not be defeated by this blow.</p>

  <p>The premonition got the better of her and as a result, she did nothing to stop the fight.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The entirety of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace shook violently as the palm met Luo Zheng's fist.</p>

  <p>Even the concubines, who were always in the depths of the Phoenix Palace, felt the tremor.</p>

  <p>A crackling sound ripped through the air.</p>

  <p>The Warrior of the Stone Hill retracted its right hand, a crack spreading along it all the way to its shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Ah?"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge looked at her Other Shore Token in disbelief.</p>

  <p>It was unbelievable that the right hand of the Warrior of the Stone Hill had cracked!</p>

  <p>There were many kinds of Other Shore Tokens with different abilities on the Other Shore. The Warrior of the Stone Hill was ranked among the top five Other Shore Tokens of the descending type in the Lust World.</p>

  <p>Its strength and defensive power were considered the best in the Lust World. Feng Ge had the ability to fight against the masters at the Chaotic Source Realm with the help of this Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>And now, Luo Zheng had broken its arm with just one punch!</p>

  <p>The direct descendants of the Phoenix Palace looked on in shock at the powerful punch that had shaken the earth.</p>

  <p>"He is outrageous!"</p>

  <p>"I've never heard of a person like him in the Taiyi Heaven Palace!"</p>

  <p>"But where is he? Why can't I see him?"</p>

  <p>"It looks like Feng Ge's Other Shore Token sent him underground. He might have broken the Warrior of the Stone Hill with his punch, but I think he's badly injured as well!"</p>

  <p>As they speculated, the ground behind Feng Ge began to bulge. Before anyone could react, Luo Zheng emerged from it and made his way towards Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was surprised to see Luo Zheng alive. He had taken the most powerful palm strike from the Warrior of the Stone Hill and turned it on the warrior such that it hadn't been able to bear the impact.</p>

  <p>How had this guy remained unharmed?</p>

  <p>When Feng Ge saw that Luo Zheng was coming straight at her, her eyes began to flash with a golden light, like two suns shining in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"No, Feng Ge! You can't!"</p>

  <p>Flamine was horrified at what was about to transpire before her eyes.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was going to release the divine flames of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was now too close to Feng Ge. It was too late for Flamine to stop him.</p>

  <p>With a crisp sizzling noise, gold flames poured out of Feng Ge's body in all directions.</p>

  <p>At the rate they were going, they might burn everything they touched.</p>

  <p>The people of the Phoenix Palace watched the golden flames, paling in horror.</p>

  <p>The divine flames of the Jin Wu also existed in the furnace at the gates of the Heavenly Cultivation Palace. Everyone knew of the power of the flames. Anyone who touched them was sure to die.</p>

  <p>The whole Heavenly Cultivation Palace would catch fire if Flamine didn't stop the flames soon!</p>

  <p>Once the people of the Phoenix Palace moved to a safe location, the ribbon that was on Flamine flew into the air and twisted into an enormous circle, a bright golden light radiating off of it.</p>

  <p>The divine flames of the Jin Wu had been contained, but Luo Zheng was in trouble.</p>

  <p>Flamine was regretting not taking any early action. If she had known this would happen, she would have stopped it at the very beginning. She shouldn't have let the two kids fight each other.</p>

  <p>She turned to look at Luo Zheng but was surprised at what she saw.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glowed within the golden flames, unafraid of being burnt by the divine flames of the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>He grabbed Feng Ge's snow-white neck with one hand and pushed her down, sneering as he said, "Your flames are stronger than those of the demon women of the Divine Lair, but if you think you can burn me to death, you're dreaming! Release them! Or I will kill you!"</p>

  <p>But Feng Ge was incredibly tough.</p>

  <p>She hadn't the slightest intention of giving in. Flames lit up on her body, completely wrapping her within them. She grinned and said sarcastically,</p>

  <p>"Your strength is indeed beyond my expectation. But can you really kill me?"</p>

  <p>"Keep talking and you will see soon enough!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said, laughing. The pupil of his right eye suddenly began to glow.</p>

  <p>As the white light flashed, the Snow Sword came to his hand with a sudden whooshing sound.</p>

  <p>It was difficult for Luo Zheng's demonic eye to see through powerful warriors who had gone through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. Feng Ge was powerful, but she was still in the Lust World with Luo Zheng and hadn't gone through the Chaotic Source Reinforcement yet.</p>

  <p>As he activated his demonic eye, he found many flaws in her body.</p>

  <p>The only thing that could protect her was the flame textures that wrapped her tightly within them, protecting her from getting injured.</p>

  <p>But with the help of the Authentic Visual World, Luo Zheng saw that these flame textures were not perfect. There were still minor flaws in the gaps between the textures.</p>

  <p>'Under the neck!'</p>

  <p>That was where the flaw of the flame textures and Feng Ge's flaw overlapped.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was sure to die if he were to attack that spot.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng brought his sword down, a flash of fear entered Feng Ge's heart.</p>

  <p>She had assumed that under the protection of the flame textures, Luo Zheng would not be able to kill her. But she now had a premonition that this sword strike was going to shatter her into pieces.</p>

  <p>Red light flashed in Luo Zheng's eyes, magnifying the fear within her.</p>

  <p>She saw a faint illusion in which her body shattered to the ground like porcelain. Now that her emotions were all over the face, the apathetic defense that she had put up, collapsed.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Please don't kill me!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge cried, her body straightening up and her hands curling reflexively.</p>

  <p>Her tears evaporated into steam the moment they formed, thanks to the golden flames.</p>

  <p>She had never been so afraid of death in her life.</p>

  <p>"No, please!"</p>

  <p>Flamine was horrified at what was transpiring before her.</p>

  <p>The Snow Sword stopped abruptly, humming in midair, the tip pointing at Feng Ge's chest.</p>

  <p>"Release them, and I will not kill you," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>Killing Feng Ge would be his last resort now.</p>

  <p>But this evil woman was stubborn. She'd never make a concession unless her life was threatened.</p>

  <p>"Please don't kill me! Please!"</p>

  <p>Feng Ge seemed not to hear Luo Zheng as she continued to beg.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already withdrawn the demonic eye but she was still seized with fear, unable to emerge from the panic it caused.</p>
