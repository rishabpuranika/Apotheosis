<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After the water tornado disappeared, the large whirlpool dissipated as well.</p>

  <p>The mad swirling in the center of the whirlpool had gradually subsided.</p>

  <p>Dorothy and the others saw that the water flow in this area had also returned to normal, merging with the other seawater.</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable! It's gone!"</p>

  <p>"The whirlpool really disappeared!"</p>

  <p>"Let me have a try at this!"</p>

  <p>Immediately, someone drove the Truth Boat forward.</p>

  <p>With the others watching carefully, this brave soul actually managed to move without any struggle or stops.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>The others laughed aloud as they followed suit with excitement, driving their Truth Boats forward too.</p>

  <p>Falling into the whirlpool was like a death sentence. They had thought they were doomed for sure. But somehow that had all changed.</p>

  <p>Things had not gone as they had expected. Before long, the whirlpool was gone. They couldn't believe it.</p>

  <p>All kinds of strange noises rang from creatures on the Truth Boats.</p>

  <p>Although the humans might not have understood these cries, the excitement and joy were easy to feel.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, on the other hand, was abnormally calm.</p>

  <p>She sat on the Truth Boat with a smile spreading across her face.</p>

  <p>She had been worrying about how to explain what had happened to Felicity; luckily now she wouldn't have to. The crisis had been solved.</p>

  <p>No wonder her grandmother had attached such great importance to the fact that Luo Zheng was able to enter the Sea of Truth in the form of his body. If such a man entered the Other Shore, it would surely destroy the balance.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had just begun to sink deep into thought when a sloshing sound of water pulled her out of it. Luo Zheng had already emerged from the bottom of the water.</p>

  <p>She fixed her eyes on him, knowing she could not see his blurred appearance but still staring at him intently.</p>

  <p>"It seems that calming the whirlpool was really very easy for you," said Dorothy with thinly veiled astonishment.</p>

  <p>"It was indeed less difficult than I imagined," Luo Zheng confessed, smiling and drawing his hand from the water.</p>

  <p>Dorothy noticed that he held a candle tightly in his right hand.</p>

  <p>"What's that in your hand?" Dorothy asked, staring at the candle in confusion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shook the seawater off the candle and threw it to her. It landed in front of her on her Truth Boat with a thud. "The candle was the cause of that big whirlpool," he then said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Dorothy's eyes lit up in fascination as she held the candle in her hand.</p>

  <p>It was unthinkable that this candle that she now held was responsible for the huge whirlpool in which so many were imprisoned.</p>

  <p>As she stared at the candle, the other Truth Boats returned. When those making their way back caught sight of Luo Zheng, they guessed the whirlpool probably disappeared thanks to him.</p>

  <p>They all rushed up to him to express their gratitude.</p>

  <p>They wished to thank him for sure, but they had another purpose as well.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was capable of stopping the whirlpool and roaming the Sea of Truth with his body. Thus they required no more convincing to befriend him.</p>

  <p>"Nice to meet you, sir. I'm a disciple of the Floating Mountain. May I know your name?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you for saving us, sir. I am the chief disciple of Jade Mountain..."</p>

  <p>"My name is..."</p>

  <p>Dorothy grew impatient seeing the warriors being so enthusiastic to entice Luo Zheng. "We were just trying to save ourselves and happened to save you as well. You do not need to thank us. You can be on your way now!" she said with a furrowed brow.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they were all disappointed at Dorothy wanting Luo Zheng all to herself.</p>

  <p>Some in the crowd began to say, "Hey, it's a long way on the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>One more friend means one more chance we have. Sir, you helped us out of the whirlpool, we must repay such a great debt."</p>

  <p>"That's right. We are not ungrateful people!"</p>

  <p>"Sir, may I know where you are from? We would like you to join our Floating Mountain. I guarantee that..."</p>

  <p>Dorothy took several deep breaths to calm herself. The Necklace of Mystic Soul she wore began to give off a majestic aura. The small sword above her head revealed itself as well. She could not contain herself any longer and exploded with a yell, "Go away!"</p>

  <p>The small sword darted back and forth wildly above her head, so fast one could barely see it. If her mind did not remain calm and still, there was no telling how many people could be killed in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>These people struggled to escape the whirlpool and somehow survived; they would have hated to die at the hands of this woman. Their fears of death were very real once again.</p>

  <p>"You crazy woman!" they cursed in anger, but dared not pester Luo Zheng anymore. The crowd soon began to thin out.</p>

  <p>Dorothy let out a sigh of relief having driven these wretched people away.</p>

  <p>"Well, you can leave and come back in the form of Soul of Light," she finally said.</p>

  <p>As long as Luo Zheng didn't reveal anything himself in the Sea of Truth, it would be near impossible for them to discover his identity. Luo Zheng also did his best not to let anyone connect his body with his Soul of Light. Once all of them had left, he exited the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a shape could be seen in the distance; Luo Zheng's Truth Boat had materialized.</p>

  <p>Dorothy moved towards his boat and threw the candle onto it.</p>

  <p>Even with her multitude of experience, she didn't know what the candle was. She did know that it was no ordinary thing and even rarer than many Other Shore Tokens. However, she was not greedy and had no desire for it.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng picked up the candle and looked it over. He then asked No. 9527 with curiosity, "Apart from making a big whirlpool, what other function does the candle possess?"</p>

  <p>"Making a big whirlpool? Haha! You underestimate the candle," No. 9527 said with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Luo Zheng asked feeling slightly lost.</p>

  <p>"This is the Soul Candle, a key item for entry to the Dark Region. It is extremely rare even on the Other Shore," answered No. 9527 after thinking for a while. "But my master hasn't been on the Other Shore for many years.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they have mastered a method of producing Soul Candles in bulk."</p>

  <p>"What's the Dark Region?" Luo Zheng then asked.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 didn't answer. "There is so much you do not know about the Other Shore. It would take a long time to explain it to you. It will do you no good to know it right now."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders and focused on steering the Truth Boat.</p>

  <p>After a couple hours, the currents became rough again and their boats were pushed back by shallow waves rising from the Sea of Truth.</p>

  <p>"The resistance is growing stronger. I think we have reached the second line," Dorothy warned.</p>

  <p>"Charge over now!" Luo Zheng did not hesitate.</p>

  <p>He had too many mysteries and questions of the Other Shore. He wanted to cross the Sea of Truth as fast as possible.</p>

  <p>He was confident that his Soul of Light was strong enough to pass the second line. What was more, he had a lot of soul pills with him. He felt he had little to fear.</p>

  <p>"Alright!" Dorothy said beaming.</p>

  <p>Truthfully, she really wanted to give up on the Sea of Truth and tell her cousin this piece of good news.</p>

  <p>Once she and Luo Zheng reached the sixth line, then she would ask him to take the candle at the bottom of the whirlpool and save her cousin.</p>

  <p>She wondered how her cousin, aunt and uncle would react when they heard this good news.</p>

  <p>While she was lost in fantasy, she started to feel the Sea of Truth fighting back, and her Truth Boat began to shudder.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Dora, calm down. What are you thinking about?" At this critical moment, as they were about to pass the second line, Dorothy was still absent-minded, which made Luo Zheng curious.</p>
