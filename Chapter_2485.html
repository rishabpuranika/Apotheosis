  <p>"The Thousand Sanskrit Land?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was stunned, realizing that he had asked the right person the right question.</p>

  <p>Even Bromley and Mike hadn't been able to answer this question. They had, after all, worked out the Primal Chaos Technique by themselves, but hadn't known how far it would go.</p>

  <p>Lorena nodded and stared at her son as if he was some strange creature.</p>

  <p>"They stumbled across the right way pretty unexpectedly.</p>

  <p>I used to think that all hope was lost. Maybe this is a turn for the better.</p>

  <p>This is the will of the Chaos Ancient God! The Chaos Ancient God is helping us!" Lorena exclaimed excitedly.</p>

  <p>Lorena had been pleasant before, but now she seemed so happy that she had completely immersed herself in her thoughts.</p>

  <p>Seeing that his mother had zoned out, Luo Zheng waved his hands in front of her, trying to bring her back to the present.</p>

  <p>At this, Lorena came back to her senses. She was embarrassed to have lost her manner before Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Mother, what happened? What is the Thousand Sanskrit Land?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Once Lorena had calmed down, she said, "Luo Zheng, do you know what the divine land is?"</p>

  <p>"A ship?" Luo Zheng replied, his answer a question.</p>

  <p>Lorena nodded and said, "It looks like Harold has told you that. The divine land is a big world, but it's also a ship. Do you know the purpose of this ship?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no idea.</p>

  <p>He only knew that the ship was constantly falling.</p>

  <p>According to Holy Jay's explanation, the divine land would finally crash.</p>

  <p>And with the crash of such a huge world, perhaps all the creatures in the divine land were destined to die.</p>

  <p>After all, nobody else except the Holy Beings could resist the chaotic energy that swarmed into the divine land.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Luo Zheng said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>Lorena sighed and explained, "The divine land used to be a ship that embodied the hope of the Nine Li people. It's a ship that was used to flee."</p>

  <p>"Flee?" Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Yes." Lorena nodded. "The Nine Li race was a big race that enjoyed a long history in the Source World, but was defeated by the Yellow Emperor. Countless people were slaughtered. In order to continue our race, in our desperation, we had to create the divine land and enter the endless chaos."</p>

  <p>Lorena's face reflected the grief and indignation she felt at the mention of these things.</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race was prosperous, with nine tribes and one hundred thousand Nine Li Guards among its population. They were powerful enough to dominate the Source World.</p>

  <p>However, the race had declined while Lorena had still been young, and the race leader had been repressed. In the end, they had had no choice but to make an unwise decision.</p>

  <p>"The divine land is a ship and it was used as a means of escape!" Luo Zheng was stunned upon hearing this.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the extraordinary creatures in the depths of the chaos also had different sides and fought and killed each other.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought for a moment before asking, "That's not right. Since the Nine Li people managed to escape, why aren't there many of them in the divine land?"</p>

  <p>Such a huge race had escaped using a large ship that was the divine land.</p>

  <p>It had probably taken away tens of thousands of its people.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had been in the divine land for a long time. He knew that there were some strange races and countless True Gods in the divine land. But he had never heard of the Nine Li race.</p>

  <p>If there was, then his mother was probably the only one belonging to it.</p>

  <p>Lorena smiled. "There are two people here, aren't there?"</p>

  <p>"Two?" Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>"You and I." Lorena laughed. "The Nine Li race is divided into nine tribes, each with different bloodlines. And you have the most authentic bloodline of Chiyou among the nine tribes."</p>

  <p>Only then did Luo Zheng understand what his mother had meant to say.</p>

  <p>Since he was a descendant of the Nine Li race, he was a Nine Li man.</p>

  <p>What was more, he had inherited Lorena's bloodline.</p>

  <p>But he still felt that something was wrong. He suddenly looked at Yan in his arms and asked, "If I'm a Nine Li man, what about Yan?"</p>

  <p>Since he and Yan were both Lorena's children, why hadn't Lorena taken Yan into consideration?</p>

  <p>"No, she is not one of us," said Lorena.</p>

  <p>"You mean Yan isn't your biological daughter?" Luo Zheng asked carefully, a little nervous.</p>

  <p>Lorena unexpectedly smiled at this and said, "I certainly did not mean that. Yan is indeed your sister, but her bloodline is special. This is also related to me in some ways. But she has a different bloodline."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Luo Zheng said, relief and understanding crossing his features.</p>

  <p>"In the beginning, there were many Nine Li people in the divine land,"</p>

  <p>Lorena said as she looked at Luo Zheng. "You may not have heard of the Nine Li race, but you should have heard of another race."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pondered for a moment before the mysterious race his mother was hinting at appeared in his mind as an obvious answer.</p>

  <p>"The Sacred race!" Luo Zheng blurted out.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Lorena said, almost whispering.</p>

  <p>The first time Luo Zheng had seen the Sacred race was in Holy Bromley's fairy palace.</p>

  <p>At the time, he had had a great interest in this perfect race.</p>

  <p>Later, when Murphy had launched a war in the universe, the Sacred race from the Murphy Universe had arrived, ready to battle. He had known at the time that the said Sacred race was not the real one. It had merely been a result of Murphy's imagination.</p>

  <p>He had later discovered the fact that the real Sacred race came from the divine land.</p>

  <p>In the very beginning of the divine land, it was this mysterious race that had ruled it.</p>

  <p>The Sacred race was the first to study the Godly Way Tablets. It was the most powerful race, and was one that had Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Since the Sacred race was so powerful and had obvious advantages, other races had had no chance to rise.</p>

  <p>But according to some ancient books of the divine land, this mysterious and powerful race had suddenly disappeared overnight.</p>

  <p>This had become somewhat of a strange mystery in the divine land.</p>

  <p>There was an answer to this mystery, one that was in the hands of a very small number of people, and one they had never made public.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng suddenly thought of the legends of people who had comprehended the Divine Dao in the remote ages, and asked, "Was it necessary for the Sacred race to comprehend the Divine Dao? Shouldn't they all be extraordinary, powerful creatures?"</p>

  <p>Lorena shook her head. "Even though the Nine Li people were very strong, there were still quite a number of weaklings among the tribes.</p>

  <p>Some people were still young, and their strength was similar to that of the divine citizens in the divine land. The head of our race had left three thousand Divine Dao on the ship of hope. We had to pass them on."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brow cleared as he felt enlightened by his mother's explanation.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the three thousand Divine Dao had all been created by the head of the Nine Li people.</p>

  <p>"Then why did the Sacred race disappear?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Because of the pursuing troops," Lorena replied. "The Yellow Emperor had to kill us to spare himself the trouble that was bound to emerge later.</p>

  <p>He couldn't allow the tribe with the purest bloodline of the Nine Li race to escape. He had sent Yellow Emperor Guards to chase after us. Even though we tried our best to resist, one of the Yellow Emperor Guards managed to use the Blood Splitting Technique."</p>

  <p>Lorena seemed to travel back to the ancient times through her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"The Blood Splitting Technique is extremely vicious. It's a way of killing everyone within a radius. With just a few drops of blood of just one of us, he could kill all our people within a certain range. He did his best and used the Blood Splitting Technique, and turned all our people in the divine land into blood foams, causing them to explode.</p>

  <p>That's why later generations of the divine land think that the Sacred race disappeared overnight. It was because they all had died!"</p>

  <p>Lorena looked sad. Luo Zheng's question had drawn her into a painful memory.</p>
