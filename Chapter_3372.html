<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Sea Dragon race couldn't be considered a super force in the Source World. Naturally, their resources couldn't compare to those of the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>However, they made up for it with their extraordinarily strong bodies. Their dragon scales were considered treasures and served as natural armor.</p>

  <p>The three brothers, named Yasin, Musa, and Amir, were quite lucky. The gap in their respective numbers was within a hundred. Additionally, even though a strong wind had begun to rise as soon as they entered the Chaotic Source World, they were able to find each other and team up.</p>

  <p>Musa and Amir had sinister expressions, both smiling viciously at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"So, you are unwilling to let go of the Chaotic Source Spirit." Zheng narrowed his eyes at them.</p>

  <p>Yasin quickly stowed away the Chaotic Source Spirit into his space ring.</p>

  <p>Then, he turned to wink at his two brothers.</p>

  <p>Musa and Amir immediately took the hint. In the blink of an eye, Zheng was surrounded.</p>

  <p>Yasin laughed. "When we were outside, you seemed to have a powerful background. However..." His eye twinkled mischievously. "I didn't expect you to be such an idiot! The moment you saw us, you had a chance to escape. But now, I am afraid you're done for. Musa, Amir, get him!"</p>

  <p>Yasin shook his head. He thought Zheng would be smart, but apparently, he was just a dumb fool.</p>

  <p>They would spare him no mercy.</p>

  <p>With a brisk flick of the wrist, Musa and Amir summoned two long sabers.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore Power flowed throughout their bodies. Their scales began to glow a blue light, which was the Sea Dragon race's body language for excitement.</p>

  <p>"You think I'm stupid because I didn't run away?"</p>

  <p>Zheng asked slowly, a smile creeping on his face.</p>

  <p>There were many creatures in the Chaotic Source World. Almost all the large races and super forces had come today.</p>

  <p>However, out of all the creatures present, only seven or eight were worthy of catching Zheng's attention. These buffoons from the Sea Dragon race were not one of them.</p>

  <p>"Chop him!"</p>

  <p>"Take this!"</p>

  <p>The long sabers cut through the black smog. With eight hundred divine megatons of force, they could almost crack both the heaven and the earth.</p>

  <p>Both Musa and Amir were confident in themselves.</p>

  <p>The Sea Dragon race was weak; the Other Shore Tokens they obtained weren't anything outstanding. Fifth-grade Other Shore Tokens were rarely seen in their race.</p>

  <p>However, the world was just in a sense. They had a much stronger body to make up for this deficiency.</p>

  <p>Both Musa and Amir slashed at Zheng, their long sabers arcing in the air. Zheng then calmly raised his hands.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Yasin wrinkled his nose.</p>

  <p>Why was this human trying to grab the sabers with his bare hands? How futile!</p>

  <p>In the eyes of the Sea Dragon race, human bodies were very soft and fragile. The many large races would think nothing of them unless they had undergone the Chaotic Source Reinforcement.</p>

  <p>'This man is definitely asking for death, ' Yasin thought to himself gleefully.</p>

  <p>The two long sabers were powerful enough to slice Zheng in half.</p>

  <p>Musa and Amir shared the same sentiments.</p>

  <p>They had been worried that Zheng would use some strange Other Shore Token when they charged. If he did, it would've been difficult to deal with him.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, this stupid human was only using his bare hands to defend himself!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Musa and Amir blinked in a dazed confusion. To their shock, the two long sabers were wedged firmly between Zheng's clasped hands.</p>

  <p>But his hands were no longer flesh. They had turned pitch black, like two iron hands gripping the two blades.</p>

  <p>Yasin, who had been watching from a distance, dropped his mouth open in sheer shock.</p>

  <p>The mighty warriors who had reached the Chaotic Source Realm were able to catch the two sabers with their bare hands.</p>

  <p>But just as the three of them did, Zheng came to undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. How could he do that?</p>

  <p>Before Musa and Amir could react, Zheng's Strength God Totem suddenly released over a thousand divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>He twisted his two hands, snapping the blades in half.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>In one motion, Zheng used the two broken blades against their original wielders.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The broken blades released two blue rays of sharp light in the air and cut Musa's and Amir's throats. They stared blankly forward, unmoving. Slowly, their heads slid off from their necks, and their bodies collapsed.</p>

  <p>'The black smog is very annoying. My speed has been reduced by a lot, '</p>

  <p>Zheng thought, as he rubbed his wrist impatiently. Then, he turned to stare at Yasin expressionlessly. "I am not a bloodthirsty man. You would've been fine if you just handed over the Chaotic Source Spirit. Unfortunately, you are short-sighted and greedy. You deserve it."</p>

  <p>With that, he suddenly leapt towards Yasin with incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Although the black smog was blocking him somewhat, he still managed to close the distance in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>For Yasin, it was as though time slowed down and he was seeing everything in slow motion. Yet, he was frozen in place, seized with remorse.</p>

  <p>The Sea Dragon race had arrived very early, so they had witnessed what had happened at the entrance of the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>Strong warriors like Fuxi paid much attention to Zheng, and the human young man in black was from his inner world. How could he be afraid of three members of the Sea Dragon race?</p>

  <p>Then, Yasin snapped back to his senses. It was too late for regrets, now.</p>

  <p>Without further hesitation, Yasin turned around and bolted.</p>

  <p>In the Chaotic Source World, hurricanes would occasionally appear out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>The strength of the hurricane was far from something that Yasin could resist. As long as the hurricane rose, no one knew where he would float to.</p>

  <p>By then, Zheng could do nothing to him.</p>

  <p>Although both Zheng and Yasin couldn't move too quickly in the black smog, Zheng was obviously faster.</p>

  <p>Within a few seconds, Zheng was only a few feet away from Yasin. As Zheng closed the gap, he threw a punch at Yasin's back.</p>

  <p>"Dragon Scales for Body Protection!"</p>

  <p>Yasin sensed Zheng's strike from behind, and immediately activated the natural armor of the Sea Dragon race. Instantly, the edges of his dragon scales were covered by honeycomb-shaped patterns, hardening his skin tenfold.</p>

  <p>Dong!</p>

  <p>Zheng's fist struck Yasin's back with a dull sound.</p>

  <p>Yasin buckled a bit under the force of Zheng's blow, but he recovered quickly and continued to run as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>'The bodies of the Sea Dragon race are truly solid, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>'If any ordinary human took a punch, they'd be dead by now.'</p>

  <p>Little did he know that Yasin was under a great deal of pain.</p>

  <p>The strength of Zheng's punch was enough to cause some serious internal bleeding. He spat out blood as he ran, cursing under his breath. There was no way he could take another punch like that.</p>

  <p>Sensing that Zheng was closing in on him once more, Yasin made a split second decision. Gritting his teeth in frustration, he pulled off his space ring and threw it as far as he could in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>Even though the black smog posed some resistance, the space ring flew over a hundred feet away.</p>

  <p>Zheng hesitated. The Chaotic Source Spirit was stored in the space ring. In that moment, Zheng chose to give up the chase and turned towards the direction the space ring landed.</p>
