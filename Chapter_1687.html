<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1687 Take Advantage Of The Situation </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>The Primal Chaos Technique was related to his master, and even his own secret physical body. How could Zheng tell Lone, the Otherworldly Swordsman about it that easily?</p>

  <p>He had followed suit the moment he witnessed Chaotic Life Vitality Strike.</p>

  <p>Its effect was astonishing.</p>

  <p>Lone's strike with his mighty sword even helped Zheng gain new insights.</p>

  <p>He smiled slightly, and then answered confidently, "I got it by chance!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the spear thrust forward like a dragon!</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear was so powerful that it could destroy anything.</p>

  <p>Even though its power was much lesser than that of supreme chaotic weapon, the destruction it could cause was astonishing.</p>

  <p>Besides, the spear light contained a sort of gray glow which was formed with a combination of Metal Law and chaotic energy.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng had forced Lone into a predicament, he wasn't ready to give up just yet.</p>

  <p>The sword he was carrying had originated in the divine land.</p>

  <p>It had accompanied its former master for tens of billions of years.</p>

  <p>However, after its former master died during the battle in the Spirit Mountain, severe efforts to destroy it were made. The sword was still powerful, but had dulled a lot as compared to its original state.</p>

  <p>The ultimate purpose of the sword was to let Lone grow and become more and more powerful. In that way, he would one day become a True God, who could bring the sword back to the divine land and restore it to its original glory! Until then, the sword would take its revenge on those who had harmed its former master and itself.</p>

  <p>That was the reason it had paid such a price to sneak into the Illusion Battlefield and help the Otherworldly Swordsman get a chance to participate in the challenge.</p>

  <p>The top ten warriors were going to be awarded with a Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>The sword was aware that the Godly Plate was a necessity for someone who wanted to become a True God. But that only wasn't enough to make them a True God. To become a True God, a warrior had to satisfy a lot of requirements.</p>

  <p>Thus if he became more powerful, the Otherworldly Swordsman ultimately had the chances to become a True God.</p>

  <p>However, the catch was that he was losing to Zheng. But the sword was unwilling to accept the defeat.</p>

  <p>A touch of indignation could be seen on Lone's face.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think... you can defeat me?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's spear was already flying toward him. Lone raised his sword and gently put it down.</p>

  <p>Lone acted like he was placing the sword back in the rack, but suddenly started to sway it in the air.</p>

  <p>He then retreated a few steps back, and fell down on the ground. His eyes were shut, mouth half-open. He really did seem unconscious.</p>

  <p>Everyone's attention, including Zheng's, was on him. Suddenly, the sword swung up in the air and sprinted straight toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>The sword itself was battling against Zheng!</p>

  <p>In the battle ring, any warrior could only be declared the victor if his opponent accepted defeat, or was killed.</p>

  <p>The sword had been controlling Lone, and hence his soul had fallen into a deep sleep. Zheng was now fighting the sword alone, while his real opponent was lying limp on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Wow! What method is the Otherworldly Swordsman using? Is he controlling the sword with his perception?"</p>

  <p>"To me, it looks like the Otherworldly Swordsman has fainted. How can he still use his perception?"</p>

  <p>"Something's wrong. It feels like the sword is in control here!"</p>

  <p>Most people couldn't get what was going on, but they were speculating.</p>

  <p>In the past, the Otherworldly Swordsman had attracted the attention of some very powerful masters of the Thoughtless Minds, and even the four great clans had shown interest in him.</p>

  <p>Even the Supreme Lord of Original Sin had tried to contact him personally! Perhaps, all they wanted was to somehow acquire the sword from him...</p>

  <p>However, the sword's response to all of them was extremely resolute.</p>

  <p>Although it wanted to return to the divine land as it belonged there, it wasn't something that could be controlled by any random being. Even a Supreme Lord would not be able to control it!</p>

  <p>It had always chosen its master itself and would never allow anyone else to acquire it.</p>

  <p>If the Thoughtless Minds members had taken action against Lone, the sword would've sealed itself. At a time like that, it would turn into a mere piece of scrap metal.</p>

  <p>Lone, the Otherworldly Swordsman was a warrior of the Thoughtless Minds anyway. Since the attitude of the sword was so decisive, the four great clans had no choice but to give up quietly. They withdrew their intentions of taking away the sword. If it wasn't for the sword's will itself, Lone would not have been able to keep such a divine object on his own, considering his cultivation base and strength.</p>

  <p>Only a few warriors knew about this, so the matter was quite secretive.</p>

  <p>"Clang!" The sound reverberated in the arena!</p>

  <p>Even though the sword was broken, it was still a supreme chaotic weapon that originated from the divine land.</p>

  <p>It was easy to kill Lone, but it was impossible to destroy this sword.</p>

  <p>When Zheng's spear thrust out, the gold and grey spear light pierced through the sword and produced a long and crisp sound. The slender sword trembled for a moment before it spiraled behind Zheng and headed towards the back of Zheng's head!</p>

  <p>Now that the sword did not need to protect Lone, it had become unbridled!</p>

  <p>Zheng reacted incredibly fast. The tip of his spear slid across the ground, etching in it a fine scratch, and then the spear suddenly thrust back up.</p>

  <p>The Metal Law burst forth!</p>

  <p>"Chaotic Metal Law Strike!"</p>

  <p>Because the move was learned on the spot, its power was extraordinary!</p>

  <p>Zheng had no choice but to make this move. The sword was too powerful.</p>

  <p>If it touched him even once, he would surely be beheaded, even if he had a divine weapon body.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The sound rang again, as the golden-gray light deflected the sword.</p>

  <p>Zheng's back faced Lone, and he was in face of the sword.</p>

  <p>Just as the spear hit the sword, the sword spun around in the air. A faint color appeared on its surface. At the same time, it also started to tremble, sending out strong vibrations in all directions.</p>

  <p>Although the internal momentum was not that powerful, it was still a complete one, something that far exceeded the internal momentum of the Godly Genius!</p>

  <p>Tianming, who'd been observing the situation closely, widened his eyes at the scene. Cracks began to appear on the scabbard on his back.</p>

  <p>"Crack, crack..."</p>

  <p>The scabbard was made of dragon skin. The tendons attached to it were real dragon tendons!</p>

  <p>To his shock, the tendons were falling apart. The sword in the scabbard was like a wild beast, struggling to break free!</p>

  <p>Tianming reached for the scabbard and held the sword in its place. A strange light flickered in his eyes. Softly, he murmured, "Calm down, calm down..."</p>

  <p>After he successfully pacified the sword, its restlessness gradually dissipated.</p>

  <p>The eight warriors who were also present at the Heaven Earth Board were also startled by the powerful aura that the sword was sending out.</p>

  <p>Lawson and Nathan observed its vibrations seriously, feeling a tingling sensation on their bodies.</p>

  <p>Both of them wanted to be ranked first. Naturally, they paid proper attention to their potential opponents.</p>

  <p>Lone had displayed his skills in the Thoughtless Minds, but that hadn't really threatened Lawson and Nathan.</p>

  <p>What they hadn't expected was that the sword would turn out to be so powerful!</p>

  <p>Shania of the Demon Night remained silent as she didn't have much of a reaction to the scene that was unfolding in front of her.</p>

  <p>Kurt of the Blessed Buddha Land placed his hands together, rubbing the Buddhist jade bead between his palms slowly. He only said one word softly, "Amitabha..."</p>

  <p>As for Margaret, she was highly tensed. Her lips were curled, and her eyebrows furrowed in anticipation. If Zheng got eliminated, she would admit defeat immediately and head to universe to look for him.</p>

  <p>The sword didn't give Zheng much time once the aura started to burst forth.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, it dashed at Zheng!</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Zheng's face...</p>

  <p>He raised the spear horizontally. With a quick movement of fingers, he shot out a thin wind blade and thrust it towards Lone instead of the sword!</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Lone was still unconscious, in no condition to resist the blade.</p>

  <p>And so, Zheng managed to cut his head off effortlessly.</p>

  <p>The sword was advancing toward Zheng at the same time, but halted right before it was about to pierce his chest.</p>

  <p>"Zheng Luo wins this battle! Lone, the Otherworldly Swordsman loses..."</p>

  <p>The mysterious young girl's voice announced the result.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Heaven Earth Board, the warrior was pronounced winner as soon as the opponent admitted defeat or was killed.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't sure about whether his trick would work or not, but he knew it was worth a shot. He realized he only needed to kill Lone who lay behind him to really achieve victory. He could win this time because he knew how to take advantage of a situation.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>The sword vibrated violently in front of his chest, as if it was unwilling to give up. It seemed like it was still determined to stab and kill him!</p>

  <p>However, the mysterious girl was watching them closely. She had made the announcement based on the rules. She wouldn't let Zheng be killed unlawfully.</p>

  <p>"The stones on the Heaven Earth Board are not enough. The top ten warriors will now participate in the round-robin battle. No one is eliminated," the girl announced, after which the sword finally stopped vibrating.</p>
