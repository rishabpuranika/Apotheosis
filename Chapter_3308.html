<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monsters shuddered at the mere thought of the thing they dreaded the most: Luo Zheng would aim at the holy tomb.</p>

  <p>His question rang repeatedly in their heads, which made them tremble profusely in fear.</p>

  <p>Despite that, they still had the gall to curse fiercely at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Move your dirty hand away!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you, a dirty human, touch Master Teague's holy tomb!"</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" they all shouted.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, their noises caused the other pig-faced monsters to come out of the caves as well.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge looked at Luo Zheng solemnly. "Those pig-faced monsters are besieging us again," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Leave them alone," Luo Zheng replied expressionlessly.</p>

  <p>They could leave the Other Shore at any time anyway. Moreover, the creatures from the Dark Region couldn't get inside, which meant that he could try anything he liked.</p>

  <p>He turned a deaf ear to the pig-faced monsters' cries and carelessly walked around the holy tomb. Finally, he stopped in front of it and bowed down.</p>

  <p>This action surprised Feng Ge as she didn't know what Luo Zheng meant. Still, the act had now excited those pig-faced monsters.</p>

  <p>"He's finally enlightened. He's going to submit to our Master Teague!"</p>

  <p>"Even if you kneel down and beg for forgiveness, we can only let you die-- but it is not so painful!"</p>

  <p>"Since you have thought through this, you can step out now!"</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng was done bowing, he stood up and smiled at the pig-faced monsters. He then suddenly jumped up to the tomb and dug it out with his hands!</p>

  <p>He knew that the only way to leave the place was to look for the answer that lay inside the tomb.</p>

  <p>He bowed to the tomb because of his moral. Whether the purified being was dead or not, it was indeed disrespectful to dig a tomb.</p>

  <p>Those ferocious pig-faced monsters were dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>They never thought that Luo Zheng would actually be so bold to dig the tomb!</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>"Please!"</p>

  <p>"No? we are so sorry, Master Teague?"</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monsters could only cry out in despair when they realized that threatening Luo Zheng didn't work. In fact, it just irritated him. Thus, some of them began to plead with him to stop.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng knew that the pig-faced monsters were never to be trusted, so he completely ignored them.</p>

  <p>"Swish..."</p>

  <p>He tossed away the masses of mud he had dug out until the long, thin stones below came into view. The stones were highly cold to the touch.</p>

  <p>He tried to break the stones, but failed. He couldn't believe that they were so hard that he couldn't damage them even for a little bit.</p>

  <p>Finally, he started with the side of the tomb. He took out the stones and threw them towards Feng Ge, who stood not far away.</p>

  <p>The stones should contain a very potent amount of the Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>Since they didn't melt in the light, they could be fused as the Other Shore Tokens!</p>

  <p>After Feng Ge picked up the stones and put them in her space ring, she went by the tomb's side and carefully peered down.</p>

  <p>Once all the stones were removed, a circular cave with a diameter of three feet appeared beneath.</p>

  <p>"The tomb is empty?" Feng Ge's eyes narrowed. If there was an underground passage below, they would get out of the place.</p>

  <p>"Let me get down to have a look," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Just as he was about to jump inside, that dark blue pig-faced monster showed up again beside the light column.</p>

  <p>Its angry mouth seemed to shout the words, "You will regret for what you have done!"</p>

  <p>The rest of the pig-faced monsters also roared and the whole valley was blanketed in a thick fog of unease. Even the tentacles in the valley quietly retreated back to the triangular caves.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng just cast a glance at the dark blue pig-faced monster before he jumped into the cave beneath the tomb.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge was left alone at the tomb's entrance, her eyes filled with nervousness.</p>

  <p>Although she clearly knew that the pig-faced monsters couldn't get in, their howls that seemed to shake mountains still terrified her a little.</p>

  <p>"Let's cover the light!"</p>

  <p>"Block the light and get them out!"</p>

  <p>"Let the tentacles do this!"</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monsters and the tentacles had previously dashed into the light column blindly without a thought.</p>

  <p>As a result, the light had melted their bodies in various degrees.</p>

  <p>At the moment, one of the pig-faced monsters seemed to have come up with an idea. The light was indeed powerful, but it could not destroy stones in an instant.</p>

  <p>Then all the tentacles that had retreated to the triangular caves extended to the outside of the valley and pulled the huge stones on the outside back to the inside.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, Feng Ge saw a huge dark shadow in the distance. It was a huge stone that the tentacles had thrown over her head!</p>

  <p>The giant stone naturally blocked the column of light that shone from above, casting a shadow on Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>Her legs were frozen in place. She was speechless and didn't know what to do.</p>

  <p>"Catch her!"</p>

  <p>"Kill her!"</p>

  <p>"We can get in now!"</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monsters that had stayed outside for a long time had run out of patience. As soon as the stone blocked the light, they hurriedly scampered towards Feng Ge!</p>

  <p>"Feng Ge?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who had just jumped down from the tomb's entrance, felt the light above his head fade away. His face slightly turned worried.</p>

  <p>Even though he didn't know what had happened above, he knew that the light was their only protective screen!</p>

  <p>Thus, he jumped upwards without hesitation and tried to find out what happened.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, it was easy to go down but hard to go up. When he tried to rush towards the entrance, a weird force abruptly pulled him in and he fell down from a height of about forty feet!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh?"</p>

  <p>As he slipped further down, four pig-faced monsters had already reached Feng Ge in a blink of an eye. One of them reached out and grabbed her in an attempt to drag her out.</p>

  <p>In turn, Feng Ge instinctively launched a counterattack.</p>

  <p>The golden light around her body flickered continuously until it turned into golden whips, which lashed at the pig-faced monsters like a violent storm.</p>

  <p>Yet, the divine flames of the Jin Wu still wasn't enough to render considerable damage to them.</p>

  <p>"Right after we got back here... We are in danger?"</p>

  <p>Despair racked Feng Ge's body, and she was close to giving up?</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a beam of light glittered brightly once again.</p>

  <p>Even if the giant stone did temporarily block the light, the light also tarnished it because it was an object of the Dark Region. In just a few seconds, the light had pierced through the giant stone.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The bright light shone on Feng Ge again.</p>

  <p>Before the pig-faced monsters around her could scream, the light beam had melted their bodies away, filling the air with a pungent smell.</p>

  <p>The light won a little bit of time for Feng Ge to breath. Her face however, changed dramatically when she saw the tentacles lift a number of giant stones.</p>

  <p>She would never have a chance to escape once the stones completely covered the light!</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, she quickly jumped into the cave beneath the tomb.</p>

  <p>The situation outside the cave was extremely critical, and the same could be said for inside of it.</p>

  <p>A small white shadow floated in front of Luo Zheng. It didn't contain very strong energy, but it seemed that it posed a great threat to him.</p>

  <p>It turned out that this white shadow was the force that pulled him down just now!</p>

  <p>At that point, his face twisted in horror when he realized that the white shadow had targeted Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"Watch out!" he screamed when seeing Feng Ge jumping down.</p>
