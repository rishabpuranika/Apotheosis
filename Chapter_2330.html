  <p>
</p>

  <p>True Gods who had been to the Dark Fog Forest knew that these Dark Crows weren't that powerful. Even low-rank True Gods would be able to kill them easily.</p>

  <p>These Dark Crows always came densely packed in groups and resided in the shadow of the Dark Fog Forest. As long as they found any True Gods, they would flock to them and attack them.</p>

  <p>It was true, these Dark Crows weren't too powerful but there was strength in numbers. If a large group managed to surround an unsuspecting True God then their destructive power could potentially be devastating.</p>

  <p>Their beaks were awfully powerful and potentially lethal even to mid-rank True Gods. If surrounded, a True God could have their entire head pierced with these beaks along with their bones.</p>

  <p>After reaching the Goddess Statue, the crows ferociously began to peck at it with their beaks.</p>

  <p>The constant tirade of pecking produced a chilling drumming noise.</p>

  <p>Cracks quickly began to appear on the surface of the statue.</p>

  <p>It was only going to be a matter of time before it crumbled into dust with the amount of Dark Crows that kept pecking at it.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart couldn't help but sink at the sight and he quickly dashed in the direction of the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>However, before he could even get close, he saw another figure come from not far away. It was Nelly, holding a short sword and dressed smartly in a suit. Red dots of light flashed from under her feet and she circled the statue once.</p>

  <p>The circle quickly formed into a strange killing array.</p>

  <p>With the formation of the killing array, a strange rune appeared above each Dark Crow that pecked onto the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Nelly screamed with a murderous look in her eyes before her figure disappeared into a blur.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>She slashed at the crows with incredible speed.</p>

  <p>The Dark Crows' bodies shone with blue light from the Mysterious Glimmer Balls at Nelly's first strike. Her attack was simply negated and the crows resumed to peck at the Goddess Statue. The cracks on the statue were widening rapidly.</p>

  <p>Landing on her feet after her first strike, Nelly lightly tapped her toe on the ground and looked back at the crows. "Again!"</p>

  <p>Nelly's body disappeared a second time, transforming into a blur headed for the crows.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Dark Crows that pecked at the statue were quickly slashed in half, reduced to nothing but meat and feathers.</p>

  <p>Two attacks and a clean kill - it was quite impressive.</p>

  <p>She turned her head and saw Zheng. She quickly shot him a smile hinting at provocation. "Come on!" With a shout, Nelly looked towards another approaching flock of crows above. She jumped and quickly made another circle that enveloped them.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and followed right after her.</p>

  <p>Since there was quite a number of True Gods more concerned with scrambling after the divine might coins, those who were more focused on killing the Dark Crows had to double their efforts to protect the Goddess Statue.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, their best effort didn't seem to be enough. A couple of crows still broke through their defenses and pecked at the statue from time to time. Despite being killed almost immediately by the True Gods, the crows still caused some significant damage.</p>

  <p>"We can't go on like this!" Reginald roared in anger. "Stop picking up the divine might coins! I already told you: everyone will get an even share once we kill all these crows!"</p>

  <p>His words did not have any effect, to his frustration.</p>

  <p>After seeing the extensive damage the Goddess Statue had suffered, some True Gods gave up and focused on getting as much money as they could instead.</p>

  <p>They figured that they would be unable to enter the second stage of the forbidden area at this point so they might as well seize the opportunity to make a profit off this venture. They might regret it in the future if they missed this chance.</p>

  <p>This behavior did not just piss Reginald off. Even Soren and other top-rank True Gods looked angry.</p>

  <p>Top-rank True Gods were naturally more ambitious than ordinary True Gods. Divine might coins were indeed very tempting but they hoped for better rewards in the long run. It frustrated them that the fellows with them were short-sighted and only focused on what they could see.</p>

  <p>"Let me do it," a top-rank True God said.</p>

  <p>"Bevan Moon?" Reginald couldn't help but be surprised but a joyous smile soon appeared on his face. "That's good!"</p>

  <p>Bevan Moon and Reginald both came from the Floating Island of the Moon Clan but one came from the Moon Sect and the other from the War God Hall.</p>

  <p>Given the absurdity of their situation, someone had to step up. Killing the crows wasn't hard but it proved challenging since they all needed to launch at least two attacks to kill each batch. Strategy and cooperation were key but they couldn't do that if some of them were too greedy and scrambling on the ground for divine might coins.</p>

  <p>As luck would have it, Bevan Moon cultivated the Great Dominance Technique.</p>

  <p>He took a deep breath and a light brown gem appeared between his brows. This gem was a pure magic stone that could greatly enhance the momentum of his soul.</p>

  <p>When the light brown gem appeared, it began to flash brightly and exerted an extremely strong soul pressure amongst everyone present. It felt like being in the presence of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Of course, Bevan Moon was merely a top-rank True God and his soul wasn't anywhere near the strength of a consummate True God, much less a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>However, with the help of the Great Dominance Technique, he could project an irresistible aura that could give off the illusion of him being a Holy Being. Everyone, including those that were scrambling around for coins, felt a chill run down their spines.</p>

  <p>"Everyone, let's get rid of the crows first. Once we've dealt with them, then we can divide the divine might coins equally.</p>

  <p>If anyone dares disobey, they will die!"</p>

  <p>At the mention of the word 'die, ' Beven Moon raised his voice and boomed his threat so that it could be heard by everyone.</p>

  <p>Many of the True Gods present trembled at his orders and felt that they would really die if they disobeyed.</p>

  <p>It was an empty threat, of course. Bevan Moon couldn't really join hands with other top-rank True Gods to kill them if they chose to collect the divine might coins instead of fighting the crows. There were so many Holy Beings watching outside the Time Sea Forbidden Land after all and most of the True Gods here were closely connected with them. Killing without a legitimate reason could only result in troublesome consequences.</p>

  <p>However, the True Gods subconsciously chose to believe Bevan Moon's words and follow his orders.</p>

  <p>This was the magic of the Great Dominance Technique. At a high enough level, it enabled one to have a strong leading power that caused other people to submit humbly.</p>

  <p>"Let's just kill these Dark Crows first!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone, let's stop gathering the coins. Since Bevan said that the coins will be equally divided later then it would be best if we deal with the crows first!".</p>

  <p>"Another flock is coming! Everyone get ready!"</p>

  <p>The True Gods were now resolute and no longer had greed clouding their vision. They were motivated to fight the crows instead of gathering up their divine might coins.</p>

  <p>Most of them were not truly resolute and were merely influenced by the Great Dominance Technique.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, it still worked to unite them.</p>

  <p>The Goddess Statue was once again surrounded protectively by the True Gods. With their concerted effort, the protective circular ring grew larger.</p>

  <p>The Dark Crows could no longer cross this line and hurt the Goddess Statue.</p>
