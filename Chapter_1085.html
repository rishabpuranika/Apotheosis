<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Logan Yun's proficiency in Space Law was actually more than what the other warriors had expected. Who knew that he had the ability to manipulate space into creating a layer of armor over his body?</p>

  <p>The question now was whether his opponent could tear through space.</p>

  <p>Majority of the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm did not have the strength to break through space. This meant that there was a high probability for Logan to emerge from this fight unscathed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't help but be amazed at how profound the inheritances of the four divine kingdoms were. With these inheritances, warriors in the divine kingdoms were supposed to be stronger than those in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Titus Zhao's attack was extremely sharp, but Logan Yun's suppression made it hard for him to unleash his full force.</p>

  <p>If only he had the strength to tear apart space or if only he had also been skilled in Space Law, then Titus Zhao would've stood a chance.</p>

  <p>However, it was becoming quite apparent that his fierce attacks and formidable Fire Law would not be enough to win him this fight.</p>

  <p>The result was obvious to Luo Zheng at least.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid Titus Zhao will lose," he murmured to himself, but the warriors beside him still heard it.</p>

  <p>To put into context: Titus Zhao was heralded as one of the most powerful warriors of the Wisteria Martial House and even in the entire Star Field Divine Kingdom. The warriors from his martial house looked up to him and prayed hard for his victory.</p>

  <p>So to suddenly hear an unknown warrior from the Harlen Divine Kingdom proclaim that their hero would lose was unacceptable to them.</p>

  <p>"How dare you say that!" one of the warriors from the Wisteria Martial House shouted at Luo Zheng. "Are you courting death, you brat?" Luo Zheng was quite startled at their outburst, but tried to not take their reactions to heart.</p>

  <p>"Titus is our Wisteria Martial House's top warrior! He's also one of the six strongest in our Star Field Divine Kingdom. You're not at all qualified to judge him!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah! He's just someone from a divine kingdom that ranks last. Besides, it's obvious that the Jade Martial House is even far more inferior to the Dark Martial House. I heard its strongest warrior is someone called Gregory Zhan. Ha! I bet this Gregory won't last ten seconds in a fight against someone like Titus!" "Just ignore him! He's clearly delusional!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng rolled his eyes at their heckling.</p>

  <p>He couldn't really be mad at them. These warriors were flowers raised in greenhouses and had been given the best inheritances by their divine kingdoms. Luo Zheng understood that they'd think more in terms of black and white absolutes.</p>

  <p>He chose to remain silent and be the bigger person. However, the warriors of the Jade Martial house couldn't just let the insults pass.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" "Did you just say that our Jade Martial House is inferior to the Dark Martial House?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe you guys should shut up because your mouths stink of lies!"</p>

  <p>"You all think your Wisteria Martial House is some kind of hotshot?</p>

  <p>Let's wait and see. Gregory will surely beat the shit out of your warriors!"</p>

  <p>"It's hilarious how someone from a martial house made up of eunuchs actually has the balls to talk nonsense like these."</p>

  <p>That last diss made by a warrior from the Jade Martial House was what really burned the egos of the warriors of the Wisteria Martial House.</p>

  <p>Yes, the Wisteria Martial House was indeed ranked number one in the entire Star Field Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Martial Houses were established with the support of the divine kingdoms and were mostly founded by war kings or war emperors. Wisteria Martial House, however, was founded by eunuchs.</p>

  <p>It might be surprising at first but eunuchs actually made mighty warriors.</p>

  <p>They had a natural advantage when it came to cultivation since, after castration, they could then train and hone their methods and skills with pure positive energy that they could never lose.</p>

  <p>Not only that, but Wisteria Martial House also had several warriors at the Soul Sea Realm with them, and they were all eunuchs.</p>

  <p>But, no matter its strength and prestige, the warriors from other martial houses still called it the Eunuch Martial House behind its back.</p>

  <p>There wasn't really anything they could do about it. It would be impossible to shake off the title. Besides, they weren't calling that to their faces, so the warriors from the Wisteria Martial House let it slide.</p>

  <p>However, the Jade Martial House had gotten pissed and pointed out their biggest insecurity right at their faces.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Wisteria Martial House glared daggers at those of the Jade Martial House. Enraged, they circulated their life vitality in preparation for a retaliation.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the Jade Martial House stood with their heads held high.</p>

  <p>They were not afraid. All of them were warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Why should they be afraid?</p>

  <p>At that moment, just as the tension was at its height, a majestic Mu Ning enveloped all of them.</p>

  <p>It was the Mu Ning of a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm who had suppressed them in an effort to calm the disturbance.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning pressed firmly onto the heads of warriors of both martial houses. It was as if there was a solid mountain that bore down on their foreheads and kept them in place. Even Gregory was no exception. His breathing was labored and there was an unexplained heaviness in his limbs so that he couldn't even find the strength to lift a finger.</p>

  <p>This was the power of a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the only one who remained calm and indifferent. He gazed up at the mighty warrior in the distance and gave him a faint smile.</p>

  <p>This surprised the warrior at the Soul Sea Realm. He could feel that there was a warrior that had not been affected by his Mu Ning at all. He gave Luo Zheng a curious look before inevitably retracting his power over the other warriors.</p>

  <p>'Since when did the Jade Martial House have such a powerful figure?</p>

  <p>Even my Mu Ning couldn't suppress him!' he thought to himself, positively intrigued.</p>

  <p>The soul of a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm was trained to be in the Fighting Soul Realm. Under his Mu Ning, those warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm should've effectively been suppressed and unable to move. Luo Zheng didn't show any signs of moving, but the warrior at the Soul Sea Realm just knew that he was unaffected.</p>
