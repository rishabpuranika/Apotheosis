<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although the Explosive Ferocious Ant itself was not a powerful foe, its explosive power was extremely terrifying. No matter who was fighting against the ants, they would have to be cautious when dealing with them.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the only way to pass through the eighth tree branch was an arduous task which would exhaust one's strength. One had to lure the Explosive Ferocious Ants aside and kill them one by one.</p>

  <p>However, watching Luo Zheng brazenly charge into the group of ants, Vivian and the others' hearts did indeed lurch, and they almost rushed after him.</p>

  <p>However, a faint smile was growing on Amber's face!</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, she hadn't had much interaction with Luo Zheng before.</p>

  <p>However, back in the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place, the various incidents which Luo Zheng had featured in, had also been spread in detail from the Tower of Sin. She knew that this was Zheng's usual way of doing things. If he was to follow the rules, he would not be 'Luo Zheng'. He could never wait inertly for someone else to take action, Luo Zheng always rushed in and his bravery always carried the day.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng didn't stop at all as he jogged past them, and the number of Explosive Ferocious Ants following behind him grew in number until it was a lengthy train of ants that covered the ground!</p>

  <p>"There are so many Explosive Ferocious Ants. If they were to all explode together, how powerful would the explosion be?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't he afraid of being blown up and dying? He would lose a lot of Illusion Points if that happened!"</p>

  <p>Aurora was staring curiously at Zheng's actions. Hearing their discussions, her face changed as if an idea had suddenly occurred to her. She then said, "Back off! Everyone, back off! Stay as close to the main trunk of the Sacred Ailanthus as possible!" She seemed to know what was coming.</p>

  <p>Now, everyone could see that Luo Zheng was planning to lure these Explosive Ferocious Ants to gather together.</p>

  <p>The might of a single Explosive Ferocious Ant's terminal combustion had already been so astonishing to behold. How shocking would it be if hundreds of ants, tightly packed together, all exploded at the same time?</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng rushed forward, a black mass of Explosive Ferocious Ants had already gathered behind him.</p>

  <p>"Now is the time!"</p>

  <p>He suddenly turned and rushed forward, grabbing an Explosive Ferocious Ant in front of him.</p>

  <p>This Explosive Ferocious Ant was ten feet long, much longer than Luo Zheng was. Furthermore, the ant itself possessed immense strength. Even a tiny, grain-sized Explosive Ferocious Ant could lift something that was ten times heavier than itself!</p>

  <p>However, as Luo Zheng grabbed the Explosive Ferocious Ant, the ant opened the two pincers next to its mouth and viciously launched towards Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>In one smooth motion, Luo Zheng grabbed one of the pincers, and with a surging force, he twisted the head and then ripped the Explosive Ferocious Ant's head off.</p>

  <p>The moment its head was torn off, Zheng's other hand grabbed the abdomen of the ant and hurled it backwards among the other ants.</p>

  <p>This Explosive Ferocious Ant was actually a very strange creature. Ever since it was born, it had been constantly exhausting its own power to stabilize the explosive flames in its stomach, carefully preventing them from exploding. It was like being born with a ticking bomb inside it. If it was seriously injured or dying, it was then unable to stabilize the explosive flames! After the explosive flame lost its binding, it naturally caused a violent explosion!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already wrenched off the head of this Explosive Ferocious Ant, so naturally, the explosive flames on its abdomen had begun to lose their bindings. While the ant was still flying through the air, the explosive flames in its abdomen grew brighter and brighter, until they were ready to...</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The abdomen landed right in the middle of the group of Explosive Ferocious Ants chasing after Luo Zheng where it rolled on the ground!</p>

  <p>Accompanied by a flash of incandescent light…</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The sound of a huge explosion echoed out, leaving everyone's ears ringing and hurling them to the ground in the ensuing shortwave.</p>

  <p>The Explosive Ferocious Ants next to the abdomen did not dodge in time, and were naturally caught by the deadly explosions. Hence, the explosive flames in their abdomens exploded once again, slaying more Explosive Ferocious Ants.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The Explosive Ferocious Ants exploded one by one, creating a destructive chain reaction.</p>

  <p>When tens of the Explosive Ferocious Ants exploded at the same time, another few hundred ants were detonated.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>A series of explosions resounded in everyone's ears. The strength of the explosions far exceeded their expectations and the ground even shook under the violence!</p>

  <p>A huge mushroom cloud slowly rose from the ground, and they could see very little beyond the billowing clouds of dust and spent chemicals!</p>

  <p>Accompanying the explosion was an extremely powerful shock wave that spread out in all directions like a flood.</p>

  <p>Even the Sacred Ailanthus, which was as big as a mountain, was shaking gently!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng maintained a careful distance from the place where the explosion had occurred. Both of his legs remained fixed in the ground, like nails had firmly nailed him in place, while he had a firm look on his angular face, as he bore the brunt of the shock wave.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Aurora had asked everyone to retreat to the main trunk of the Sacred Ailanthus behind them from the start.</p>

  <p>When the shock waves spread out, it was as if there were giant invisible hands pressing everyone down to the ground and even tightly into the tree trunk, preventing them from moving at all. It almost felt as if the air was being crushed from out of their lungs by the intense pressure.</p>

  <p>If they had still been standing foolishly on the eighth tree branch, they would have been launched headfirst towards the main trunk of the Sacred Ailanthus by the impact of the shock wave.</p>

  <p>In that case, even if somehow, they didn't die; they would at the least have been severely injured!</p>
