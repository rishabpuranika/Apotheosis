  <p>
</p>

  <p>Leyton shook his head at Samuel and said, "It's far from enough. I'll ask Zavier to speed up and target the central divine cities."</p>

  <p>An ordinary divine city only had about a hundred thousand people. But the central divine cities of the regions usually had more than a million or even millions of people in them.</p>

  <p>Every time Zavier launched an attack, he could capture all the people of a divine city.</p>

  <p>If this spread out, it would cause panic in the divine land. That was why he would be prepared with all possibilities before making a move to ensure that no one would be left alive.</p>

  <p>But attacking the central divine cities wouldn't be that easy. The Thousand Commandments Slates could not hurt the warriors at the Other Shore Realm, but they would still cause him a lot of trouble.</p>

  <p>"Drop it. Have you found a way to release the Abyss Demon Region?"</p>

  <p>Leyton asked.</p>

  <p>Samuel sighed regretfully, "Not yet."</p>

  <p>"How many divine might coins have you collected?" Leyton asked, carefully arranging his features into one devoid of expression.</p>

  <p>"Alfredo is responsible for it. All the powerful clans are handing in the divine might coins. The quantity is quite large," Samuel answered honestly.</p>

  <p>Leyton nodded. "Let's do this as soon as possible. We have the Sea Cracking Skull, but the powerhouses at the Other Shore Realm are too strong. We must be fully prepared even before they enter the divine land. If we survive this disaster, I will recommend your name for the Yellow Emperor Guards when we return to the Source World. You will be a hero to our Bear race!"</p>

  <p>Samuel was surprised at this. But he overcame his surprise quickly enough, saluted and said, "I will do my best!"</p>

  <p>Even though the Yellow Emperor Guards had specifically chosen to attack the divine cities at the edge, they had caused panic on a small scale.</p>

  <p>Every time Zavier launched an attack, a divine city would be emptied.</p>

  <p>There were a few second and third-tier clans outside of the divine cities.</p>

  <p>When they reached the city gates, they discovered that the guards had all disappeared.</p>

  <p>They entered the cities, only to find that all the people had disappeared as well.</p>

  <p>This was strange, but it was happening across several large regions in the northeast of the divine land.</p>

  <p>In the house of the Cao Clan in the Bright Night City, a melodious tune wafted out of the magnificent hall.</p>

  <p>Several enchanting women, all low-rank True Gods, danced and sang in the hall. They were all pretty and their every movement was charming and enticing.</p>

  <p>That was the internal momentum of the Enchantment Godly Way.</p>

  <p>When cultivators reached the highest level of the Enchantment Godly Way, they would be capable of befogging people's minds.</p>

  <p>But this was not the right way and its theurgy was not very powerful. Those who chose to cultivate the Enchantment Godly Way were mostly women.</p>

  <p>They wanted to make themselves more attractive and win the hearts of powerful masters.</p>

  <p>"Nathan, your cultivation base has reached a higher level. You might successfully become a consummate True God without the help of the Bai Clan. You are really an extraordinary talent! Don't forget me when you reach a high position in the Bai Clan in the future!"</p>

  <p>Nathan leaned against a large seat, slightly drunk.</p>

  <p>The wine in the Bright Night City was produced using a special method. It could put even the top-rank True Gods in a state of dead drunkenness.</p>

  <p>The one who was speaking to Nathan was the young master of the Cao Clan, Bruno Cao.</p>

  <p>Bruno looked like a young man but he was not actually young. He had already lived through two divine eras.</p>

  <p>But he still had to show some respect in front of Nathan.</p>

  <p>The Cao Clan, as a second-tier clan, also had top-rank True Gods, although they weren't on par with Nathan.</p>

  <p>Bruno felt that Nathan was extraordinary. This unknown fellow had already become a top-rank True God in just a few years, and at such a speed, even the elite members of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands couldn't compare with him. And now, he was on his way to becoming a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>The Cao Clan had already reported the news. It wouldn't be long before the Bai Clan came to the Bright Night City to pick Nathan up.</p>

  <p>Bruno hoped that Nathan could help him if he were to become highly valued by the Bai Clan in the future. His life would be made if he could enter the Floating Island with Nathan's help.</p>

  <p>"I won't forget you if I join the Bai Clan," Nathan said, amused.</p>

  <p>He had set his sights on the Floating Islands ever since he entered the divine land and got a general understanding of how the divine land worked.</p>

  <p>Thanks to his own talent, his cultivation speed was quite fast. It had only taken him ten years to become a top-rank True God, which was enough for him to gain the favor of the powerful clans.</p>

  <p>He was now tipsy. But Zheng suddenly came to mind.</p>

  <p>Where was Zheng now? Had he become a True God? If he had, was he a low-rank True God or a mid-rank one?</p>

  <p>Nathan wondered how Zheng would react if he knew that he had the ability to join a powerful clan.</p>

  <p>Nathan didn't have any enmity with Zheng, but he felt that Zheng was the one he had to surpass in his life.</p>

  <p>When he had first entered the divine land, he had been at a loss for a while because the divine land, unlike the Evolutionary Universe, was a completely strange place to him.</p>

  <p>But he wanted to surpass Zheng, so he gritted his teeth and showed his talent, slowly attracting the attention of the Cao Clan. His status in the Bright Night City rose rapidly from then on.</p>

  <p>Now, even the master of the Cao Clan showed respect whenever he saw Nathan, and Bruno, the young master of the Cao Clan, followed him everywhere.</p>

  <p>"Report!"</p>

  <p>Someone rushed into the hall, a look of panic on his face and his voice trembling.</p>

  <p>The sound of his voice brought all the dancing women to a halt.</p>

  <p>"What happened? Why are you in such a state?" Bruno asked, standing up, annoyed that he had disturbed Nathan and him.</p>

  <p>"Since Master is in seclusion, I can only come to report to you. Something has happened in the Bright Moon City!" the man said, clearly horrified.</p>

  <p>As a second-tier clan, the Cao Clan ruled three divine cities, one of which was the Bright Moon City.</p>

  <p>Bruno frowned and asked, "The Bright Moon City is protected by the Hundred Commandments Slate. What could possibly happen?"</p>

  <p>Most True Gods thought that the divine cities were extremely safe. Nothing could go wrong under normal circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Everyone in the Bright Moon City is gone!" said the man, his eyes as wide as saucers.</p>

  <p>Bruno was shocked. "What? What are you talking about? You must be mistaken!" he barked at the man.</p>

  <p>"Impossible! I didn't go there alone. A total of twelve people, including me, searched for half a day in the Bright Moon City, but we didn't see a single person, not even the stewards of the Cao Clan!" the man said, his voice dripping seriousness.</p>

  <p>"How could this happen?" Nathan exclaimed, realizing the gravity of the matter.</p>

  <p>What kind of power had the ability to empty a divine city?</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Cao Clan was a part of the Bai Clan and the Bright Night Region was under the protection of the Bai Clan. Who could have dared to do this so brazenly?</p>
