<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2931 Killing </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The light of the thunder punishment lasted for five minutes. The blazing white light caused great discomfort in the eyes of the Holy Beings, and the constant roars were deafening.</p>

  <p>Eventually, the fierce thunder punishment gradually subsided after five minutes.</p>

  <p>The thunder light began to dim, and at last, it turned into a statue-like figure that was enveloped by thunder and lightning.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the figure, Samuel clenched his fists and looked very nervous.</p>

  <p>Leyton also looked cautious. He usually had a calm demeanor, but at the moment, he could feel his heart pounding.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Flashes of lightning still cracked and sizzled on the surface of the figure, but they had become less now.</p>

  <p>Slowly, as the lightning disappeared, Zheng's figure was revealed.</p>

  <p>All the Holy Beings present were shocked at this moment as if an incredible truth had been revealed.</p>

  <p>"He is actually safe and sound," Murphy muttered to himself in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Some Holy Beings were quick to react, as they understood what it meant.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack!</p>

  <p>The remaining lightning collected in Zheng's palm, and transformed into a pocket-sized lightning dragon circling his palm.</p>

  <p>Zheng gazed at the small dragon for a while and then raised his head. He looked at Leyton in the distance and asked, "Is this the result you want?"</p>

  <p>Leyton stopped short in the air, his eyes twitching uncontrollably.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards had been imprisoned for so many years, and had long hoped and prayed for the removal of the Mixed Element Seals.</p>

  <p>But he never thought that he would have to face this consequence when he was finally free. How could he accept it?</p>

  <p>"Act now! Kill him!" Leyton roared in anger.</p>

  <p>His order could not be disobeyed, but the Holy Beings did not move as hesitation was written all over their faces.</p>

  <p>Even the deathly thunder punishment couldn't kill Zheng. If they chose to fight him, wouldn't that be like courting death?</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings were hesitant and debating this internally when Hamish and Lorcan had rushed over.</p>

  <p>They had a different stand from the Holy Beings. This was a life-or-death battle and they had no choice but to fight to the death.</p>

  <p>With a pat of Leyton's hand the Sea Cracking Skull opened its mouth.</p>

  <p>Streaks of blood spurted out from its huge mouth.</p>

  <p>When the three Yellow Emperor Guards attacked, an invisible force came from faraway.</p>

  <p>The force of the power was such that the Holy Beings all fell down.</p>

  <p>"Estelle?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was shocked when he felt the power.</p>

  <p>Estelle seldom used the Scepter of Gods' Silence, so if she used it now, she must be in grave danger.</p>

  <p>If she was still in the divine land, only the Yellow Emperor Guards could pose a threat to her.</p>

  <p>There should be five Yellow Emperor Guards in total, but two were not present.</p>

  <p>Immediately Zheng knew what might have happened.</p>

  <p>"It seems that we need to take a break for the time being." Zheng smiled slightly at Leyton and the others, who were getting ready to make a move.</p>

  <p>His body began to fade away slowly and then vanished on the spot.</p>

  <p>After he integrated with the original will, he understood the entire divine land much better.</p>

  <p>Everything in the divine land was clear to him now, and all the secrets were presented in front of him without restrictions.</p>

  <p>He thought about where Estelle was, and her location appeared in his mind, as if it was something he would already know. This was the power of omniscience.</p>

  <p>The divine land was like his inner world now.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zavier flying towards her, Estelle fought with all her might and used the Scepter of Gods' Silence again in the small region.</p>

  <p>However, the space had been locked and the power of the Scepter of Gods' Silence couldn't unlock it. Holy Jay couldn't use the Grand Teleportation to bring her into the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they could fly in the air. As long as they fled from the sealed range of over a thousand miles, they would be safe.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, the two of them transformed into two beams of light and flew off.</p>

  <p>Salim and Zavier were restricted by the scepter so they couldn't fly, but Zavier showed his astonishing physique at this moment.</p>

  <p>The small region was interspersed with hills all over but Zavier ran as fast as a cheetah. On ground he was as fast as Estelle and Holy Jay who were flying.</p>

  <p>"He's following us!" Estelle exclaimed, shocked at what she was seeing.</p>

  <p>"We have to leave this area. Speed up, come on!" Holy Jay said calmly despite the rising panic in his heart.</p>

  <p>However, the effect of the Scepter of Gods' Silence could only last for eighteen seconds at the most.</p>

  <p>Although Holy Jay and Estelle had tried their best to escape, they still couldn't put enough distance between them in merely eighteen seconds.</p>

  <p>The moment the effect of the Scepter of Gods' Silence stopped, a crazy look flashed in Zavier's eyes. He laughed maniacally and said, "Do you think you can flee from me? No way! Hahaha."</p>

  <p>With that, he jumped, and the mountains under his feet crumbled to pieces.</p>

  <p>With one leap, he passed through space and appeared right before Estelle.</p>

  <p>Salim also used the Grand Teleportation and waited at a higher spot. He didn't need to do anything in the current situation but if Estelle and Holy Jay tried to escape from this space, he could expand the area of the imprisonment.</p>

  <p>Estelle and Holy Jay were in distress.</p>

  <p>Being a Holy Being, Holy Jay could come back to life because his universe hadn't been destroyed, but Estelle couldn't. If she died, she would really die and never ever come back.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A great force blew in. Zavier was just in front of her.</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes and stopped struggling.</p>

  <p>At this point, she suddenly felt a space fluctuation in front of her.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>There came a dull sound.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Following that, there was a huge roar, as if something had smashed to the ground.</p>

  <p>Estelle slowly opened her eyes and saw a thin figure with a big arm hovering over her. Strong veins bulged on the arm as the strength source in the veins flowed slowly.</p>

  <p>There was a mixed emotion in her beautiful eyes. She could not help but call out, "Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Zheng turned his head and smiled at her and Holy Jay. "That was so dangerous. If you hadn't used the Scepter of Gods' Silence, I wouldn't have known that you were in danger."</p>

  <p>Holy Jay was relieved and he looked down.</p>

  <p>Zheng appeared and the power of his punch was extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>Zavier plummeted and smashed into a mountain. A huge crater appeared on the ground from the impact. However, he was still alive and he slowly climbed up from the crater.</p>

  <p>"Thoo!"</p>

  <p>He spat out a mouthful of blood and it instantly turned into an arrow and created a hole filled with blood on the firm gangue layer under the ground.</p>

  <p>There was no fear on his face. On the contrary, a strong desire to fight rose inside him. A person like him was born to fight, and the more powerful his opponent was, the more determined he was to fight.</p>

  <p>"Interesting. No one in the divine land can fight. Haha! I want to fight with you until the winner is decided!" Zavier laughed wickedly.</p>

  <p>Special textures emerged all over his body, and his body expanded.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked down at him and shook his head dismissively. "I don't have the time to fight with you."</p>

  <p>With a light tap of his finger, tiny streaks of lightning appeared and transformed into a small silver dragon. As his fingertip gently flipped down, the silver dragon emitted a dazzling light and turned into a huge thunder punishment, pouring towards Zavier who was still in the crater.</p>

  <p>The next thing Zavier knew, he was being swallowed by the thunder punishment.</p>
