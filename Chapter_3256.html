<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng was surprised at the offer.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Jermain looked as though he lost the ability to speak.</p>

  <p>The Grand Sky Temple was one of the three major temples in Stage Thirteen, and it was the most well-known among them.</p>

  <p>If one was fortunate enough to obtain a sixth-grade Other Shore Token from it, they would attain a massive boost in strength in a short period. The increase in power would be so immense that they would immediately become a top disciple in their force.</p>

  <p>However, the Grand Sky Temple was not easy to explore. It was full of risks, and sometimes they would end up with nothing.</p>

  <p>According to the market price, the value of the Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple was eight to nine million soul pills. But this man had blatantly blurted out sixteen million soul pills as the bid. There must be some hidden information to this that they might have overlooked.</p>

  <p>Just as Jermain was in the middle of processing his thoughts, a creature screamed and raised the price even further.</p>

  <p>"Nineteen million soul pills!"</p>

  <p>The one who gave this offer was from the Celestial Wolf race. The Celestial Wolf race was not a super force. However, its members were proud owners of massive strength. Due to them existing in a small population, they were not very prominent in the Source World.</p>

  <p>Just as the member of the Celestial Wolf race announced the bid, someone from another race raised it up again. "Twenty million soul pills!"</p>

  <p>The price was only increased by a million soul pills.</p>

  <p>Both Dorothy and Zheng were clueless about the market, so they turned to Jermain with questioning eyes as if to ask what to do next.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had put in a lot of effort to reach Stage Thirteen, he did not intend to leave empty-handed. Exploring the temples was his first priority.</p>

  <p>Jermain waved his hands and said, "The Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple is indeed precious, but it's worth no more than ten million soul pills."</p>

  <p>A pheasant-shaped Soul of Light overheard him and sneered in a sharp voice, "You might have been able to buy it with ten million soul pills three days ago. But now things have changed."</p>

  <p>Hearing what the "pheasant" said, Jermain suddenly got curious and attempted to inquire more. "Excuse me... Mr. Pheasant..."</p>

  <p>In addition to those super forces, there were countless small races in the Source World. He had no idea what race this Soul of Light belonged to, so Jermain addressed it based on its appearance.</p>

  <p>However, that "pheasant" felt offended and retaliated as it yelled, "I'm not a pheasant! I am a nine-eyed peacock!"</p>

  <p>The voice of the nine-eyed peacock was so sharp that it turned everyone's attention towards the commotion.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mouse was forced to warn them to keep the decorum of the event.</p>

  <p>"Please keep your voices low! No noise in the auction hall!"</p>

  <p>Feeling a little flustered, Jermain humbly apologized for offending the nine-eyed peacock. "I'm so sorry. Please excuse me for my ignorance."</p>

  <p>When dealing with creatures of alien races, he should have been more calculated with his words to not offend them in any way.</p>

  <p>The nine-eyed peacock was still grumpy over their last exchange, so it said in a harsh tone, "You wanted to ask about the Grand Sky Temple? The news about it has been circulating for a while now. You really have very little information. Humph!"</p>

  <p>"I just entered the Other Shore, so I have no idea. What's going on with the temple?" Jermain asked with his kindest voice.</p>

  <p>Although Jermain was reasonably familiar with everything in Stage Thirteen, he was not on the Other Shore recently. He had only returned to welcome Dorothy, which was why he was clueless about what might have happened in the past few days.</p>

  <p>"Of course! Everything has changed! They say the back door of the Grand Sky Temple has been opened, which means there is one more path to enter it," the nine-eyed peacock answered in a serious tone.</p>

  <p>"What? No way." With a hint of confusion in his eyes, Jermain continued,</p>

  <p>"As far as I remember, the Grand Sky Temple was against the Dark Region, wasn't it? Does that path lead to the Dark Region?"</p>

  <p>For the Souls of Light, the Dark Region was like a restricted area.</p>

  <p>The light emitted from them was barely enough to light up the Dark Region. If a Soul of Light accidentally stepped into it, they would get lost into the endless abyss of black space.</p>

  <p>"It is a path to the Dark Region. However, this time things are a little different. There is a ray of light in the Dark Region, and it shines from three huts. The huts are visible even from outside the Grand Sky Temple!" the nine-eyed peacock responded with arrogance.</p>

  <p>"What? Really?!"</p>

  <p>Jermain's pupils dilated visibly at his surprise.</p>

  <p>A lot of legends circulated the Other Shore about the Dark Region. It was said that the creatures of the Dark Region were the real rulers of the Other Shore. And that it contained numerous sixth-grade Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>Many such legends spread from word of mouth, but none of those were ever confirmed with concrete evidence.</p>

  <p>The reason behind less information regarding the Dark Region was simple.</p>

  <p>Anyone who entered it with their Soul of Light, never made it out alive to tell the tale.</p>

  <p>As a result, many Souls of Light attempted to cultivate different ways to counter the darkness of the Dark Region, such as the special soul fire theurgy.</p>

  <p>All the light sources provided by the theurgy were instantly put out by the darkness of the Dark Region. It was as if the fire was being thrown into the water to extinguish it.</p>

  <p>Since ancient times, the Dark Region had always been a forbidden area.</p>

  <p>But there was finally an exception this time...</p>

  <p>Someone inside the Dark Region had managed to light up a ray of light that even went as far as to shine three huts.</p>

  <p>What was the source of the light? What was in those huts? All kinds of questions and speculations circulated in the minds of every being on the Other Shore for the past three days.</p>

  <p>Every Soul of Light within Stage Thirteen fell into complete excitement from the news.</p>

  <p>Anything inside those huts would be of great value.</p>

  <p>The news spread like wildfire all across Stage Thirteen. The already expensive Other Shore Key to the Grand Sky Temple became even pricier as a result because of its demand.</p>

  <p>"If what you're saying is true, then why did the Ear Mice put the Other Shore Key on auction?" Jermain asked while rubbing his chin curiously.</p>

  <p>Dorothy had the same thoughts. She nodded to his question and said, "Yes, if the Grand Sky Temple leads to the Dark Region, the Other Shore Key should be priceless. The Ear Mice are so shrewd. Why do they choose to sell it at such a starting price?"</p>

  <p>After the door of the temple was opened by someone who possessed the Other Shore Key, other Souls of Light could enter it too.</p>

  <p>But Stage Thirteen was different in how it functioned compared to Stage One.</p>

  <p>The Souls of Light of Stage One would wait days for someone to open the door for them like a group of beggars.</p>

  <p>However, those of Stage Thirteen were much more sensible. Before they would enter the temple, they would pay the door opener with soul pills as a fee instead of freeloading. In this way, they would both benefit, the door opener would earn a profit of soul pills in exchange for their service.</p>

  <p>"I don't know either." The nine-eyed peacock shook its head.</p>

  <p>It was not just the nine-eyed peacock, but other races present in the auction hall were equally confused.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice could still be trusted in the trade. Since they were willing to auction the Other Shore Key, they were sure to hand it over to the winner if they were willing to pay the price.</p>

  <p>Since the opportunity came, many creatures bade their price up one after the other. They doubled the price to scare off potential competitors for the Other Shore Key.</p>

  <p>Although the light that shone in the Dark Region revealed itself only three days ago, most races had already found out about it. Hence, the competition for the highest bid was crazy.</p>

  <p>While they were immersed in conversation, the price had already been raised to fifty million soul pills!</p>

  <p>"The price just sky-rocketed! We'd better not join now, we can't afford it,"</p>

  <p>Jermain said as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>Fifty million soul pills was too high a price even for the Indigo Souls.</p>

  <p>Without the contribution of great forces, they would not be able to afford such a huge sum.</p>

  <p>If Jermain would have heard the news earlier, he could have asked the Origin Mountain for assistance. But obviously, it was too late to do that now.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng raised his hand and said out loud, "Sixty million soul pills."</p>

  <p>"You..."</p>

  <p>Jermain's eyes widened after listening to Zheng's offer. He almost wanted to cover Zheng's mouth.</p>

  <p>Did Zheng really own such a large sum of soul pills?</p>

  <p>The auction hall of the Ear Mice had concrete rules. Those who failed to pay what they offered would have to face severe consequences <b class="calibre3">
