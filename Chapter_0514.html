<br/><br/>

  

  <p>As the third prince of the Burning Sky Palace, Ray held a grand banquet today to entertain guests, and everyone who showed up was known for their fame and prestige.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng stepped into the grand hall, he immediately sensed several people with powerful life vitality, who, as far as he could tell, were masters of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>"Offer Luo Zheng a seat!" the third prince immediately commanded after he and Luo Zheng entered the hall.</p>

  <p>Instantly, six or seven maids showed up, walking briskly with small steps. And then a square table with fresh fruits and a variety of meats and a chair were placed in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since Ray promised to bring Mu Ning to his banquet, Luo Zheng sat down and waited patiently. As for the prince, if he was truly determined to win Zheng's support, the warrior decided he would handle the matter carefully.</p>

  <p>He didn't quite expect Ray to act so quickly. As soon as he sat down, Ray walked back to his seat and raised his jade cup with a smile and said aloud, "Luo Zheng, you won first place in the Cloud Sect's All Peaks Competition, and I've always wanted to see you since then. But you were not in Cloud Sect during the past few days. Thus, I never got the chance to meet you. Today, you have come to my humble palace, and I am deeply honored. So, I'd like to propose a toast for you. I will drink first to show my respect for you!"</p>

  <p>The majority of Ray's banquet guests heard the prince's respectful words, but many could not hide their skepticism. These people were not from the Cloud Sect. Instead, a number of them came from the top noble clans and were strong enough. Also, some were even at the level of Illuminating Soul Realm. However, the prince had never honored anyone in public like that before.</p>

  <p>Although the championship of the All Peaks Competition held by Cloud Sect was a prestigious title, these guests from the top noble clans had limited appreciation for it. Since they were never a part of Cloud Sect, these people would never have a clear perception of the strength of the disciples from this group. In their view, Luo Zheng was simply an insignificant guy at the third grade of the nature level.</p>

  <p>'The third prince is only being polite to you, showing his considerate and kind character. I didn't expect you to be so arrogant about it!</p>

  <p>Who do you think you are?' one of them thought furiously after noticing Zheng's hesitation.</p>

  <p>At that moment, all the rest of the guests shared the same thought.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng watched Ray raise his head and drink every drop of wine in his jade cup in one gulp, he hesitated, which the other guests interpreted as a sign of arrogance. But the young warrior knew he could not embarrass Ray in front of so many people. As a show of appreciation and respect, Luo Zheng also raised his cup and drank the wine in the same way Ray did.</p>

  <p>However, he felt the need to clarify some things with the prince. "Your Highness, I wish to apologize. But this time, I really came to visit Sky Princess, and not you."</p>

  <p>As he uttered the words, the faces of many of Ray's banquet guests grew even darker.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think you are?</p>

  <p>Why do you think you have been offered a seat at the Feathery Star Hall, huh? It is only because the prince thinks very highly of you and respects you!" one of them spat out with disdain.</p>

  <p>"I have never seen anyone so arrogant and act in such a manner. Do you know where you are right now?</p>

  <p>The Royal Palace!</p>

  <p>You don't know it clearly, do you, hick?" another guest burst out angrily.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing special about being a disciple of the Cloud Sect. He doesn't even know the basic rules of the Palace. How can you be so arrogant?</p>

  <p>A champion is supposed to act this way? I think Cloud Sect's reputation at this point has been unearned!" a third guest huffed.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng was taken aback by the reaction and felt as if his words stirred a hornet's nest. One after the other, guests admonished him. To begin with, they had not been pleased with Zheng's presence at the banquet. But what drew their ire was that he said his purpose was not to visit the prince but to see the princess after Ray proposed a toast in his honor and drank all the wine as a sign of respect. Did this kind of embarrassment not deserve being reprimanded in public?</p>

  <p>Ray smiled lightly after hearing his guests' indignant remarks. But, he was quite shrewd and well-bred. In his view, powerful and talented men were naturally proud, and Zheng's behavior just now was not something unexpected.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," Ray said. "Anyone who comes to my Feathery Star Hall is my guest."</p>

  <p>"But Your Highness, while he may be your guest, he does not have the right to be rude!" one of them argued.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I agree with you! If indeed he is that strong, we'll say nothing and let this go. But I'm afraid that while outwardly he may be strong, inside, he is weak and is merely pretending to be a powerful man," another guest added.</p>

  <p>The nearly violent rebuke continued until a man in white stood up from the table and said to Ray with his fists cupped to show respect, "Your Highness, since everyone is in high spirits, I would like to compete against Luo Zheng to bring some entertainment for the guests, as well as learn from him!"</p>

  <p>"That would be nice! After listening to the opera and watching beautiful ladies dancing, we feel quite bored to have drinks only. A martial arts competition would add a lot of fun to drinking!"</p>

  <p>The guest who spoke was thrilled at the prospect of the competition to stir things up in the banquet.</p>

  <p>Nodding, Ray said, "Since everyone is so excited and looking forward to having fun, I don't want to be the bad guy who spoils everyone's expectations. So Luo Zheng, what do you think of the proposal for a competition?"</p>
