<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 891 The Situation (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As long as they survived a whole month, they would be able to see the results!</p>

  <p>If it would be just what Fabian had said, the moment Luo Zheng successfully expelled all the ogres, the humans would not just get five seats in the Tower of Sin� they could gain all the other seats abandoned by the ogres! And even if Luo Zheng decided to give some seats to the Demon Night, the humans would be able to keep at least a dozen seats.</p>

  <p>In this way, the humans would grow very powerful and prominent within a very short time. They would even become the second most powerful force in the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was a mini version of the Sea God Continent. The strength of the various races in the Tower of Sin was a replica of the powers that existed in the Sea God Continent!</p>

  <p>If humans would be able to occupy so many seats and the number of human masters would only continue to grow larger and larger, before long, the Purple Heart Sacred Place would also become very strong and influential.</p>

  <p>By then, humans would truly rise to prominence in the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>And Miguel Situ was still very young. As long as he didn't die anytime soon, he would be able to witness this resurgence in person! Under his leadership!</p>

  <p>If this happened, and if the human race and the Purple Heart Sacred Place truly prospered, Miguel Situ would surely be happy.</p>

  <p>"No matter what, we have to face what's coming and try our best to fight the ogres!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I think it would be best if Luo Zheng comes to the Purple Heart Sacred Place..."</p>

  <p>The two elders continued to come up with ideas.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a bitter smile appeared on Miguel's lips. "It is hard to invite that guy to come here. I've already told Fabian to invite him twice, but he just won't come! If all of us can get through this month, I hope that he can make a trip to the Purple Heart Sacred Place..."</p>

  <p>In all actuality, it wasn't just the humans who were panicking.</p>

  <p>The ogres' situation was not any better.</p>

  <p id="top_11">The Tower of Sin was the cultivating place for talents and masters, and it was also a place that most of warriors fought for!</p>

  <p>If the ogres really were driven out of the Tower of Sin by Luo Zheng, they might not only be in trouble for a short period of time, but for a long time, and the decline of the ogre race would be unimaginable.</p>

  <p>The two ogre sacred places didn't have much interest in the Purple Heart Sacred Place, but right now, only the Purple Heart Sacred Place could be used as a threat to Luo Zheng. In order to persuade Luo Zheng to change his mind and not to drive the ogres out of the tower, the two ogre sacred places had no choice but to declare war on the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>The problem was that after the two ogre sacred places had just declared war and their warriors had just set out, the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place also declared war on the ogres. Amber personally led the troops into the surrounding area of the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>All the ogres found themselves between a rock and a hard place.</p>

  <p>Would they really destroy the whole Purple Heart Sacred Place? Even if they killed all the human race, it still couldn't change the situation in the Tower of Sin. What was even more troublesome was that the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place would definitely take the opportunity to attack and ruin the ogre sacred places. That would mean that the two ogre sacred places would be destroyed and the ogres would forever lose the Tower of Sin. And if those happened, their extinction would be inevitable.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, though, would they be willing to let the Purple Heart Sacred Place off that easily? If so, after one month, the ogres would still lose the Tower of Sin, a very important place for cultivation. What awaited the ogres was a slow death. It was easy to conclude that the ogre race would slowly decline, and eventually wither away.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, there had been a few powerful races that had been eliminated from the Sea God Continent. No one had been able to resist the force of natural selection which made sure that only the fittest would survive and breed.</p>

  <p>Many of the powerful ogre warriors at the Soul Sea Realm were also at a loss as to what to do next...</p>

  <p>They only wanted to use the Purple Heart Sacred Place to threaten Luo Zheng, but now, not only was it difficult to threaten Luo Zheng, but they themselves were about to be in danger.</p>

  <p>Amidst all the chaos and uncertainty, the most relaxed person out of everyone was Amber.</p>

  <p>Dressed in purple clothes, Amber was sitting on the top of a black mountain. Black smoke was continuously coming out from all around her.</p>

  <p>The entire area around the Flaming Ogre Sacred Place was the same. There were thousands of active volcanoes of varying sizes everywhere, which was why the name of this sacred place contained the word "flaming".</p>

  <p>The mission that Amber was given was very simple: she only needed to bring her warriors there and observe. If the ogres wouldn't attack the Purple Heart Sacred Place, then Amber wouldn't act against the two ogre sacred places.</p>

  <p>Over two hundred years ago, Amber entered the Tower of Sin. At that time, she had accumulated a lot of enmity with the ogres, and the ogres were always against her.</p>

  <p>Amber had always wanted to find a chance to destroy the ogres.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, no such opportunity had ever presented itself to her.</p>

  <p>Although the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place was a seventh-grade sacred place, if Amber forcefully fought against and destroyed the two ogre sacred places, the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place would also suffer huge losses.</p>

  <p>By then, the other races might take the chance to attack the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>However, right now, Amber realized that Zheng's appearance had created the perfect opportunity for her to weaken the ogres without sacrificing a single soldier. What was better was she could even see the ogres slowly die out.</p>

  <p>Even if Xun did not give this order, Amber would still choose to make a move� this move. She was not particularly friends with the humans, but in her eyes, the enemy of her enemy was her friend!</p>
