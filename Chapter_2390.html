<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Occasionally, there were disputes between the powerful clans in the divine land, but rarely did they ever turn into a large-scale war.</p>

  <p>Wealthy clans on the Time Sea meant to maintain the stability of the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>The divine land had a large number of divine cities, most of them having been controlled by the first and second-tier clans— they usually belonged to those wealthy clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>So the various wealthy clans on the Floating Islands actually took control of ninety percent of the divine cities through these first and second-tier clans.</p>

  <p>The Jade Bone Divine City trapped in the crater was a medium-sized divine city. Protecting it was a Hundred Commandments Slate. The Jade Bone Divine City was originally controlled by the He Clan, a second-tier clan.</p>

  <p>But it had to pay its dues to the Ru Clan, a first-tier clan, in divine might coins.</p>

  <p>The Ru Clan was situated near the Ray Tree.</p>

  <p>And this was in the eastern part of the divine land.</p>

  <p>The sun rose in the east, rising right above the Ray Tree every day.</p>

  <p>As one of the four great divine trees in the divine land, this tree was over trillions of years old, having experienced countless changes over time.</p>

  <p>Now, it was occupied by the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>Relying on the Ray Tree, the Dongfang Clan managed to gain control over hundreds of regions, hundreds of thousands of divine cities, countless divine citizens, proving godly warriors, True Gods, and so on.</p>

  <p>Some of the first-tier clans that had Demi-holy Beings were to submit themselves wholly to the Dongfang Clan's rule.</p>

  <p>No one dared offend it.</p>

  <p>A Jade Bone Divine City was nothing to the Dongfang Clan, but the entire divine city suddenly disappeared. Such a strange matter had drawn the Dongfang's attention.</p>

  <p>And this was why a team was exploring it.</p>

  <p>"Be careful. Let's observe the surroundings first," one of the mid-rank True Gods in the team said cautiously, examining the environment.</p>

  <p>"That's right, who knows what kind of power had caused this divine city to collapse?"</p>

  <p>Even if a divine city were to collapse, it would be impossible for all those True Gods to perish. Although most of them couldn't fly, even with a collapse, injury was nearly impossible.</p>

  <p>But an eerie silence now washed over the Jade Bone Divine City.</p>

  <p>The sunlight coming in from outside the crater was a thin veil that covered the divine city. One couldn't clearly see the entire city in this light. In fact, it grew even stranger and more mysterious.</p>

  <p>"Stop observing. We need to hurry up!" the young man said as he turned around, flashing a brilliant smile.</p>

  <p id="top_3">But someone in the team was still unhappy— another mid-rank True God took off his hood and said with a long face, "Lowell, you can't disobey the orders of the higher authority. This is your first task and yet, you want to act without any authorization. It seems you do not fear punishment."</p>

  <p>Lowell, the mid-rank True God, turned his head and smiled. With a shake of his head, he said, "I'm not afraid." In a flash, he dragged his black cloak, turned into a black shadow and leapt into the air, entering a crack in the city wall of the Jade Bone Divine City with ease.</p>

  <p>"Shall we follow him?"</p>

  <p>"Lowell is a bit strange."</p>

  <p>"Leave him alone. After we get back, we must report his bad behavior."</p>

  <p>The other mid-rank True Gods hesitated momentarily outside the city wall before jumping onto it and entering the Jade Bone Divine City. But they could no longer find Lowell's figure.</p>

  <p>After he entered the city, the smile on his face was wiped off and replaced with a look of vigilance and seriousness.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He sprang up and jumped onto a building before putting up his index finger and squinting as he looked into the distance.</p>

  <p>The range of slates' influence spread out in circles.</p>

  <p>So almost all the slates were placed in the center of the divine cities.</p>

  <p>Most of the divine cities were designed in circular shapes, making the best use of the coverage of slates.</p>

  <p>"Let me see. There's enough distance," he murmured to himself as he did his measuring.</p>

  <p>Then, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small fire starter.</p>

  <p>It was unique in shape, made of a kind of yellow metal instead of the usual wood.</p>

  <p>"Come on!"</p>

  <p>A flame lit up from Lowell's hand on top of the fire starter.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>This metal-like fire starter began burning as it turned into a strange green light.</p>

  <p>The moment he lit up the fire starter, Lowell turned into a gust of wind, rushing towards the center of the Jade Bone Divine City.</p>

  <p>Along the way, he jumped up and down dexterously.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>After rushing out, the things in the city began moving.</p>

  <p>If one looked carefully, they would've seen that on the wall, the cracks were densely packed with countless black and red scutigers.</p>

  <p>Even the faint light reflected on them showed the colorful colors of all their shells. The poison within each was a fatal threat to even the True Gods.</p>

  <p>It was clear that the black and red scutigers were eager to rush over and devour Lowell completely.</p>

  <p>But they seemed to be extremely wary of the fire starter in Lowell's hand— they all dodged instead of rushing head-first.</p>

  <p>In a few seconds, Lowell arrived at the center of the divine city at full speed.</p>

  <p>He leapt up and stepped onto the pavilion in the middle, giving one of the walls a heavy slap and shattering it to pieces.</p>

  <p>Behind the wall was a well where countless black and red scutigers were gathered.</p>

  <p>Lowell gently tossed the fire starter into the well before jumping in.</p>

  <p>Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!</p>

  <p>The black and red scutigers scurried away in all directions, disappearing from sight in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>A cyan slate then appeared at the bottom of the well.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>And Lowell stood firmly at the bottom of the well. When he looked at the slate, a hint of joy sparked in his eyes.</p>

  <p>The Ten Commandments Slate, the Hundred Commandments Slate, and the Thousand Commandments Slate were all very special weapons. So long as one adjusted the rules on the slate for their own protection, they could resist the enemy with just the slate's strength. But after most people came into possession of these slates, they would hand them over to their clans and build a divine city with them.</p>

  <p>Only the divine city could earn the divine might coins endlessly— it was actually quite a waste to use the slates as weapons.</p>

  <p>When Lowell found the slate, he didn't pull it out of the ground. The joy in his eyes then gradually shifted, twisting into a look of hunger and greed— he grabbed the slate and started eating it.</p>

  <p>All the slates in the divine land were of unknown origin.</p>

  <p>No clues about these slates had ever appeared in the translations of the golden Sanskrit words.</p>

  <p>And these couldn't be refined nor cut.</p>

  <p>In the past countless divine eras, even a piece of Ten Commandments Slate hadn't been destroyed.</p>

  <p>But when Lowell bit on the slate, he unexpectedly bit into it piece by piece and swallowed each chunk.</p>

  <p>The fire starter went out and the black and red scutigers were crawling towards him now. Seeing this, Lowell lit up another fire starter before he continued eating the Hundred Commandments Slate.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>A series of screams rang out in the Jade Bone Divine City.</p>

  <p>Right when the mid-rank True Gods entered the divine city, they were attacked by the black and red scutigers.</p>

  <p>The scutigers' poison was truly terrible. Once bitten by them, even a mid-rank True God could die within seconds.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, over twenty mid-rank True Gods were poisoned to death.</p>

  <p>Numerous scutigers formed a sea in black and red, blocking all the retreat roads.</p>

  <p>The only path left was the one Lowell had created with the fire starter.</p>

  <p>And so the remaining True Gods had no choice but to charge towards the center of the city aimlessly.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Only one of the mid-rank True Gods managed to get rid of the scutigers— he rushed to the central pavilion of the divine city and passed through the wall.</p>

  <p>When he lowered his head, something incredible came into view.</p>

  <p>"Lowell, what… what are you eating?"</p>

  <p>Half of the Hundred Commandments Slate had already been gobbled up.</p>

  <p>Lowell raised his head rather cryptically and smiled as he said, "The slate! Do you want some?"</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are you?" The mid-rank True God seemed to have sensed something off.</p>

  <p>"Who am I? Let's say I tell you. Then what? What can you do? You can't go back now anyway…" Lowell merely shook his head and continued gnawing on the slate.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God felt some kind of pain in his back followed by a powerful numbness. In the next moment, his entire body lost consciousness before he was covered by a dense pack of scutigers.</p>
