<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Dorothy's mood wasn't affected too much due to the fight.</p>

  <p>She rarely descended the mountain, so she was enjoying walking around the Dragon City with great interest.</p>

  <p>Monica acted as a temporary but excellent guide. She gave Luo Zheng a thorough understanding about the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>"That is the Tower of Life and Death. In case of an unsolved conflict, people can decide there, through a battle," Monica said, while pointing at a white tower, not far away.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could feel a strong malicious aura resonating from the white tower.</p>

  <p>Obviously, after every battle, the tower was always sanitized. However, it still bore some marks of bloodstains.</p>

  <p>There were all kinds of people who entered and resided at the Dragon City.</p>

  <p>Many of them came from large and powerful clans. It was therefore conspicuous that there would be conflicts among them to appease their own vested interests. Hence, the Dragon City built the Tower of Life and Death and adopted such a barbaric method to solve these contradictions.</p>

  <p>"That's the Blood Purification Hall." Monica said, as she pointed to another triangular white building. "It is said that when one becomes an Alliance Chief, they will be rewarded with a drop of the Divine Emperor Blood!" As Monica imparted this information, a look of yearning appeared on her face.</p>

  <p>"The Divine Emperor Blood?" Luo Zheng asked, stunned.</p>

  <p>Dorothy indifferently said, "It's the Divine Emperor Blood of our Taiyi Heaven Palace."</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng heard this, realization dawned on him.</p>

  <p>Since the Nine Li race had its own blood, the Taiyi Heaven Palace would definitely possess its own blood too.</p>

  <p>"So then Dora's blood must be extraordinary, right?" Monica suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>She was curious about Dora's identity. She knew that the strong masters' descendants, at the top of the mountain, were most proud of their true blood, but less about their talent.</p>

  <p>Dorothy smiled faintly and chose to ignore her question.</p>

  <p>Only after the three of them arrived at the gate of Dragon City, did Dorothy decide to leave them.</p>

  <p>"Wow! A whole day passed by so quickly! All right then, let's go and gather our people," said Monica.</p>

  <p>"Where are they now? Are they outside the Dragon City?" Luo Zheng inquired.</p>

  <p>He saw a vast expanse of plain outside the Dragon City, but no one on it.</p>

  <p>Numerous people were under each Flag Master's command. It was impossible for so many people to stay put in a place, without doing anything.</p>

  <p>"You'll know about it soon," said Monica with a smile.</p>

  <p>Soon she led Luo Zheng towards the northwest. After they travelled for more than three hundred miles, many low houses started to appear on the bare plain.</p>

  <p>Later on, they began to take shape of a large market.</p>

  <p>Actually the subordinates of the Flag Maters also needed some basic goods and demands for trading. Since they could not enter the Dragon City, they had to build a market on their own. Soon the market prospered with their continuous hard work and business sense. In a short span of time, this market took the size of a small city.</p>

  <p>As Monica summoned their members, Luo Zheng quickly noticed the disciples from the Sword Light Palace, including Beldene and Faegan. They seemed to be in good spirits, and even seemed reluctant to leave the bustling market.</p>

  <p>After engaging in a conversation with them, Luo Zheng got to know that Faegan had sold some of his items which he had collected over a period of time, thereby profiting a neat sum of money. Besides, those items were worthless in the Seven-Star Province. Faegan definitely had a fine business sense.</p>

  <p>All of them proceeded towards the plain and once they arrived there, Luo Zheng inserted the flagpole into the ground.</p>

  <p>Perhaps because of what had happened during daytime, or perhaps because of Monica, the other Flag Masters didn't stop Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Flag Master! Are we lacking something?" Jago suddenly shouted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned to look at him in confusion and asked, "What else do we need?"</p>

  <p>Jago pointed to the empty space on the flag. It turned out that Luo Zheng's flag was blank, while the other Flag Masters had inscribed their surnames on their respective flags.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not want to be an exception in this case. Just as Luo Zheng was about to take out his brush, Jago had quickly taken out an ink brush, which was dipped in golden powder. "I purchased it from the market. The words written by it will glitter brilliantly, without fading even once."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng swallowed his chuckle, before he flew up to the flag carrying his own ink brush. Then he inscribed the word "Luo" on the flag.</p>

  <p>After he finished writing, Jago and the others admired the look. Faegan, who was standing beside them, said to Luo Zheng, "I wonder what the Dragon City is like and what is in it. Have you seen or heard anything interesting in the city?"</p>

  <p>From Luo Zheng's point of view, the Dragon City was not at all mysterious.</p>

  <p>Stopping those disciples from entering the Dragon City was just a method adopted by the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"There is really no difference between the Dragon City and the Seven-Star City. But for the sake of your curiosity, I have selected some truth swordsmanship manuals," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"The truth swordsmanship manuals?"</p>

  <p>"Truth token!"</p>

  <p>Beldene's and the others' eyes immediately lit up with this information.</p>

  <p>Although the disciples had the ability to grasp and learn many kinds of truth token in the Sword Light Palace, the Sword Light Palace was nothing as compared to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Looking at the eager expressions of the disciples, Luo Zheng smiled, and as he flicked his finger, many truth swordsmanship manuals appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Kenelm, distribute these manuals to everyone," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Flag Master!" Without wasting a second, Kenelm set to work in distributing them.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng suddenly stopped him and asked, "What is the matter with you today? You are behaving very differently!"</p>

  <p>Everyone, including Luo Zheng, treated each other as brothers. However, soon after Luo Zheng came back from the Dragon City, they started addressing him as 'Flag Master'. Although it didn't matter, Luo Zheng felt very uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you are our Flag Master. We unanimously agreed to change the way we address you," said Beldene with a smile.</p>

  <p>All of them had earlier discussed and reached an agreement.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng first came to the Taiyi Heaven Palace, they just followed him all the way. Luo Zheng was under no obligation to take care of them, yet he did. Luo Zheng took them away from the Origin Mountain just because of Daisy's sarcastic comments.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng was their Flag Master, they could only count on him. For that, they had to obey some rules. This was proposed by Beldene and got everyone's approval.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was about to speak, one of the disciples suddenly shouted, "It is the Light Rain Swordsmanship! This is the swordsmanship of our Sword Light Palace!"</p>

  <p>"Calamity Destroying Swordsmanship..."</p>

  <p>"Hidden Wind Swordsmanship..."</p>

  <p>Beldene's eyes were filled with excitement as he kept hearing the different names of the swordsmanship manuals.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was surprised and asked curiously, "Have you all seen these swordsmanship manuals before?"</p>

  <p>There were probably hundreds of thousands of swordsmanship manuals on the first floor of the Truth Library. Those swordsmanship manuals chosen by Monica were merely a tiny lot.</p>

  <p>Beldene shook his head. "No. I am seeing them for the first time."</p>

  <p>"Then why do you all seem to be aware about them?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Beldene responded with a smile, "True, we haven't seen or read the manuals before. But we've all read the swordsmanship manual list before. These swordsmanship manuals are recorded on the list which divides the truth swordsmanship manuals into six levels. All of these, which you gathered for us, are at the fourth level. There are only seven fourth-level swordsmanship manuals in our Sword Light Palace, and the disciples were not qualified to cultivate them at all."</p>

  <p>The fourth-level swordsmanship manual was very rare in the Sword Light Palace. As for Beldene and Elgin, they could have the qualifications to cultivate such swordsmanship only after they reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see." Luo Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>In fact, Beldene was equally interested about the truth swordsmanship manuals. He and Elgin impatiently waited as Kenelm distributed the swordsmanship manuals. However, after Kenelm finished handing out them, they realized they were still short of the manuals. They looked at each other in disappointment, and finally looked at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Here are the swordsmanship manuals for you," Luo Zheng said with a smile, as he conjured some more manuals. "But I don't know which level they are at."</p>
