<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Cold Prisons in the Blooming Jade Stage were forbidden lands for any creature, and even Zheng didn't dare to enter.</p>

  <p>Only those who were as supernormal as Pompeo could stay in a Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>The Cold Prison had an extremely low temperature. What made it more terrible was that the creatures of the chaos seemed to slowly turn into light dots and then vanish into thin air inside it.</p>

  <p>Yet for the creatures of the Abstruse Energy World, the Cold Prison was not so dreadful. Even some relatively weak creatures of the Abstruse Energy World would only be temporarily frozen when they fell into it. Once they left the Cold Prison, they would recover from frozen state, and again return to being energized and vigorous.</p>

  <p>Zheng had decided to take action because he was worried about Yan.</p>

  <p>Although the ancestry-level bloodline could defeat all the energy, the Cold Prison was very special. It could be possible that Zheng himself might be destroyed in it.</p>

  <p>The moment he came into contact with the Cold Prison, the temperature began to rise unexpectedly. Zheng felt it was easily breakable.</p>

  <p>"You know this is the Cold Prison? And you are able to break it?" Lamont finally uttered, after a moment of silence.</p>

  <p>"There are many Cold Prisons in the Blooming Jade Stage." Zheng smiled. As to whether he could break it or not, he didn't need to answer.</p>

  <p>Lamont carefully looked at Zheng. He had been thinking about whether he should kill him earlier. "It seems that I thought too much. I'm afraid it will take me a lot of energy to defeat you!"</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>Lamont tilted his huge body and pounced towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was an old monster that had lived for countless years. His eyes were extremely sharp and he possessed great knowledge.</p>

  <p>Indeed, Zheng had an incredible method to break the Cold Prison. Even Lamont was convinced that he was capable.</p>

  <p>However, he also sensed that Zheng's strength was not enough. Lamont's physical body was an advantage; it was no doubt that he could overthrow Zheng!</p>

  <p>When Lamont went to face Zheng, a red light flashed from Yan's eyes. Golden light blades appeared, moving in cutting motions towards his head.</p>

  <p>Lamont, having suffered from a loss once, drew a huge ice cover enclosing Yan's head. He then grabbed Zheng in midair, and ruthlessly smashed him towards the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Zheng's more than four million-foot-tall body crashed into a mountain. The impact embedded his body onto the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>The originally solid and huge mountain crumbled, almost becoming as soft as mud; it was unable to bear the damage of two giant creatures.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A ray of white light flashed from Lamont's hand. A long and thin ice spike started to form and stabbed towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Zheng had no time to dodge and instead reached out his hand to grab the ice spike.</p>

  <p>As the ancestry-level bloodline started a surge within Zheng's body, the ice spike appeared to have been roasted and instantly melted into a pool of water.</p>

  <p>Lamont was stunned again. He frowned as he refused to use the power of truth any longer. He simply drew his fist back and powerfully punched Zheng!</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The sudden vibration reverberated throughout the whole Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>The scene wasn't new for many people in the Pear Hill; but the mountain leaders, the sect leaders, the disciples, and the members of the race were unable to participate in such a level of battle. On the other hand, they needed to provide Yan with a steady flow of energy.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Yan had finally smashed the ice cover on her head into little pieces. She looked for her brother, but when she saw him, her eyes turned red. He was being pressed and attacked on the ground!</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>The Energy Shaft began to shake violently.</p>

  <p>The energy gained through the Cloud Cover Array had been released by Yan.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization, the energy that the Energy Shaft could transform had greatly increased, but there was still a limit.</p>

  <p>The energy released by Yan exceeded this limit!</p>

  <p>Clatter, clatter, clatter...</p>

  <p>The huge golden blades spiraled at high speed and flew to hit Lamont.</p>

  <p>Overpowered by the golden blades, he immediately employed the Cold Prison again.</p>

  <p>The Cold Prison didn't have any effect on Zheng, but it could entirely restrain Yan's energy attack.</p>

  <p>Without sound, light or vibration, the several huge golden light blades entered the Cold Prison and turned into tens of millions of white light dots before dissipating.</p>

  <p>Yan's chest heaved up and down while her face flushed into a strange red.</p>

  <p>This kind of energy overuse did great damage to her. Shortly, she became unable to use the Energy Shaft. She could only watch in agony as Lamont kept beating up Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>Previously, during Zheng's communication with the ancestry-level bloodline, the ancestry-level bloodline had massively strengthened him.</p>

  <p>However, this strengthening was limited, and was unable to block Lamont's attack.</p>

  <p>After the Chaotic Source Spirits fell into fatigue, wounds and injuries began to cover Zheng's body. Besides his control of the temperature, Lamont's physical quality also made him become outstanding among the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>At this time, Zheng could resist if he used a Civilization Artifact's Inheritance of World. He remembered that the Primeval Lord of Heaven had given him the suggestion.</p>

  <p>But this suggestion was rejected by Zheng. Even if he activated the Inheritance of World, he might still not be a match for Lamont. After all, Lamont was skilled in dealing with the attacks of energy.</p>

  <p>He wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to continue convening the ancestry-level bloodline to come to his aid.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>Lamont attacked like a huge gorilla, his thick hands punching on Zheng's body. Zheng's chest bones cracked as they were broken into pieces.</p>

  <p>While Lamont was still launching his constant attacks, a slight confusion struck him.</p>

  <p>He felt that although Zheng's strength was very weak, he wasn't likely to have given up struggling.</p>

  <p>He looked at Zheng closely and wondered why under his body, Zheng seemed to have stopped resisting.</p>

  <p>'What's going on?'</p>

  <p>Before Lamont could figure it out, something more strange happened. Zheng began talking to himself.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you afraid of being in another person's hands?</p>

  <p>If I lose, your situation will become worse!</p>

  <p>I don't think they will let you go. You're wasting your only chance!"</p>

  <p>According to the information from the brush-wielder and the four statues, Zheng was the only one who had fused with the complete ancestry-level bloodline and was able to take it away. No one had ever done that before.</p>

  <p>Zheng's communication with the ancestry-level bloodline distracted Lamont.</p>

  <p>Although he didn't stop punching, the agitation in his eyes was evident. It grew stronger and stronger as Zheng continued to talk.</p>

  <p>Who was he trying to persuade?</p>

  <p>Was he trying to convince someone who could finish Lamont?</p>

  <p>Zheng's chest suddenly cracked...</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, no blood flowed as his broken ribs were exposed, extending to both sides.</p>

  <p>The texture of the broken ribs quickly changed and the ribs like two rows of blades directed towards Lamont.</p>

  <p>The abrupt transformation broke off Lamont's attack. He felt an instinctive threat.</p>

  <p>If he didn't kill this brat, something unexpected would happen!</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>He used up all his strength and smashed towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes, mouth, and nose sank, revealing a horrifying appearance. His face was deformed.</p>

  <p>As Lamont hit hard, his fist sunk deep into Zheng's head with a sunken face.</p>

  <p>Out of instinct, Lamont tried to pull his fist back, but he failed.</p>
