  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quietly gazed at the crystal on the Godly Plate, his heart brimming with excitement.</p>

  <p>He didn't have a Godly Tile so he was unable to use the power of Faith Energy. This also meant being unable to display the token of his Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Luo Luo Zheng was able to use chaotic energy. By relying on it, Luo Luo Zheng had managed to make up for the difference between him and the True Gods.</p>

  <p>'If there are True Gods that exist in my inner world, then my momentum could be considered coming from True Gods. If that's the case, then what's the difference between my momentum and the momentum of ordinary True Gods?'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did not know how the two differed, but he was looking forward to finding out.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>The sword cloud began to shrink. From a distance, it looked as if it was being devoured by a monster.</p>

  <p>When the whole thing disappeared, Luo Luo Zheng flashed and popped on top of the Godly Plate. After examining it for a while, he found a transparent crystal the size of his palm in it.</p>

  <p>"It became bigger..."</p>

  <p>Although the crystal had been completely integrated with the other one that was formed after absorbing the clumps of mud he previously threw in, compared to the Godly Plate, it was only a small part.</p>

  <p>"Go on!"</p>

  <p>Without hesitation, Luo Luo Zheng reached for another clump of mud, and threw it into his inner world.</p>

  <p>Minutes later, another sword cloud rose.</p>

  <p>It left behind a transparent crystal in the Godly Plate which overlapped with the other crystal, and now occupied about a third of the size of the Godly Plate. If he continued to condense the crystal at such rate, he supposed that after he threw all the mud in his inner world, the transparent crystal he finally got would be more than enough to take up the whole the Godly Plate!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng then continued to throw mud into it little by little, the transparent crystal growing larger and larger with every handful he took. The strange thing, however, was that it condensed in the middle of the Godly Plate instead of around it. It turned into a round and smooth crystal, quietly lying in the middle of the Godly Plate and emitting a faint light.</p>

  <p>This was also the first time that he condensed a Godly Tile so he had no idea whether what he was doing was correct.</p>

  <p>'Now, I should be able to get a perfect Godly Tile, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought as he threw the last of the mud in his inner world.</p>

  <p>As the mud turned into a cloud and hovered above, a beautiful crystal slowly began to take shape on the Godly Plate.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the lower part of the Godly Plate began to spin steadily and the divine textures on the surface faintly glowed.</p>

  <p>This Godly Plate was meant to support the Godly Tile and stabilize it in one's inner world. However, as Luo Zheng's Godly Tile condensed, the Godly Plate suddenly trembled.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Countless cracks appeared on the surface of the plate, and in the blink of an eye, it shattered into tiny pieces and fell into the chaotic sea.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes practically bulged out of their sockets. "What happened?"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, he felt a mild tremor in his head.</p>

  <p>The Infinity Ruler shone brightly again.</p>

  <p>The rays of light penetrated into Luo Zheng's body and straight to his inner world. The scattered rays of light gathered once again and landed on that Godly Tile!</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's inner world began to tremble.</p>

  <p>The light released by the Infinity Ruler reached the transparent Godly Tile, creating rays which bounced off in different directions. Some of them hit the chaotic sea, while some landed on the continent.</p>

  <p>"This is so strange! What is happening?"</p>

  <p>Somewhere in Luo Zheng's inner world, the Evil God stood on the top of the snow mountain and looked up at the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Right now, he could sense an extraordinary power coming off of the Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>"The power contained in this Godly Tile feels very similar to the internal momentum contained in the sword cloud that the Creator had once condensed... And yet, this is even more complicated!" The Evil God's eyes twinkled with wonder.</p>

  <p>Everything that could possibly be explored in this world had almost been comprehended by the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Except for the huge Sanskrit words on the edge of the world, there was no secret for him. He had even controlled over the Ice Soul Flame in the ice plain. Unfortunately, the Creator of this world wouldn't let him leave, keeping him confined in this world forever.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the complex internal momentum that emitted from the Godly Tile gave new hope to the Evil God. He felt like he'd be able to obtain a new token from it which would make himself more powerful.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng stared at the Godly Tile, his face displaying utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>There were all kinds of lights that flashed around the round Godly Tile, and around the outer rim, densely packed hash scales had appeared. Luo Luo Zheng squinted his eyes. Those scales were from the Infinity Ruler!</p>

  <p>Not only that, the Divine Dao marks that were absorbed by the Infinity Ruler also appeared on the hash scales!</p>

  <p>"The internal momentum of these Divine Dao has been engraved into my own Godly Tile!"</p>

  <p>During his time in the Purple Soul Hall, Luo Luo Zheng had acquired some knowledge about the divine land. Many proving godly warriors had the potential to comprehend several types of Divine Dao, but when they condensed their own Godly Tiles, they ultimately chose the Divine Dao they mainly cultivated. Only a very small number of talents were able to condense a duel Godly Tile or even a triple Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Back when he had just begun to learn the Divine Dao, Luo Luo Zheng did not understand the benefits of comprehending multiple Divine Dao. Many proving godly warriors practiced more than one Divine Dao. For example, Luo Luo Zheng had cultivated the Emotion Closing Divine Dao and Wishing Spell, and comprehended the Ice Soul Flame of the Mysterious Ice Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Before, in the Purple Soul Hall, he figured the limitations in practicing several types of Divine Dao at the same time.</p>

  <p>All theurgies, except for the theurgies beyond ways, were all divided into several levels by the True Gods of the divine land. There were the first three levels and the last three levels, which, together with the consummate level, made seven levels in total.</p>

  <p>For example, the first three levels of the Five Elements Divine Dao were the Five Elements In One, Metal Wood Destruction, Fire Wood Dynamic, while the last three levels were the Five Elements Spirit, Water Wood Separation, and the Five Elements Circulation.</p>

  <p>The seventh level, which was also the consummate level, was the Divine Five Elements Body. After reaching this level of Divine Five Elements Body, one would become a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>As for the theurgies beyond the Divine Dao, they were also comprehended from different levels of the Divine Dao. For instance, in the Heavenly Han House, the Five Elements Destructing displayed by Yazid was actually the token beyond way comprehended from the Five Elements Spirit. The Five Elements Spirit was not at high level so the Five Elements Destructing wasn't a very powerful token beyond way.</p>

  <p>Not many people were willing to cultivate the Five Elements Destructing that Yazid had displayed as some theurgies beyond way were just not as good as the ones they originated from.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Ice Soul Flame that Luo Luo Zheng had cultivated in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was the token beyond way Holy Jay had comprehended from the sixth level of the Mysterious Ice Divine Dao - the Mysterious Ice Sacred Flame. All the theurgies beyond way that were comprehended from the high level theurgies were quite powerful, so countless people hoped to inherit this token from Holy Jay. However, very few warriors had gotten this inheritance from him.</p>

  <p>It wasn't too difficult to cultivate the first three levels of a Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>With enough time and determination, one would be able to master them.</p>

  <p>Especially for these geniuses of the rich clans, it was a common thing for them to cultivate a few types of Divine Dao with their special talents.</p>

  <p>But if one wanted to cultivate the last three levels of a Divine Dao, which were more advanced, they would have to condense their own Godly Tiles. Otherwise, it would be difficult for them to use the internal momentum of the last three levels of their chosen Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>However, the token beyond way was an exception. Even if a True God had never cultivated any Divine Dao, if they could somehow grasp a powerful token beyond way, they'd be able to release terrifying power.</p>

  <p>For instance, back then when Luo Luo Zheng hadn't practiced the Mysterious Ice Divine Dao, he was still able to use the Ice Soul Flame.</p>

  <p>The theurgies at the consummate level were the most important. If one condensed the Five Elements Godly Tile, they could only become consummate True Gods by reaching the consummate level of Five Elements Divine Dao - Divine Five Elements Body. At the same time, they wouldn't be able to cultivate any consummate level theurgies of any other Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>However, True Gods with multiple Godly Tile could freely choose which Divine Dao they wanted to cultivate.</p>

  <p>There were also cases where some of them could even cultivate two consummate level theurgies and became duel consummate True Gods, which would make them more powerful than common consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Of course, the number of True Gods that had a duel Godly Tile was small, and the True Gods who could cultivate their dual Godly Tiles to consummate level were even rarer.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng saw three thousand small scales appear around his Godly Tile, something that made him feel extremely strange.</p>

  <p>This seemed to be a multiple Godly Tile, and it was a Godly Tile containing three thousand Divine Dao?</p>
