<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Killing Luo Luo Zheng would do no good. All they needed was to find a way to dispel the Holy Maiden's bad luck.</p>

  <p>However, since Luo Luo Zheng provoked the members of the divine kingdom, he had to pay an apt price.</p>

  <p>According to the people of the divine kingdom, as long as any of them got a 'free challenge', Luo Luo Zheng was destined to die.</p>

  <p>In the divine kingdom's group, the weakest of the lot were the handsome man and the Holy Maiden. However, they were both Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists. As for the black-robed people behind them, they had all reached the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>"Come what may, I want him dead!" the Holy Maiden of the divine kingdom stated in a cold voice.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng pretended not to hear their threats. Instead, he quietly settled himself on the round disc and waited for the light to shine on him once again.</p>

  <p>Next, they threw the dice, but the result wasn't in their favor.</p>

  <p>One of the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit got four dots. He stepped on the Heavenly Thunder Killing Array. Despite his cultivation being at the middle level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, he was straightaway struck to death by the lightning.</p>

  <p>Next, an elder of the World Commercial Alliance got three dots and suffered a severe punishment. Although he had endured the round, he was heavily injured and now seemed on the brink of death.</p>

  <p>Then, it was Imogen's turn again. She was punished for the second time after she threw the dice, but with her formidable strength, she was able to survive it.</p>

  <p>The consecutive punishments worried everyone present on the sidelines.</p>

  <p>Just then, the beam of light shone on Ning Yudie once again.</p>

  <p>Fortune had not been on her side. Her luck had been remarkable before, but the result this time was not good.</p>

  <p>She threw the dice lightly and it stopped at three.</p>

  <p>Three discs appeared in front of Ning Yudie. The third disc seemed to be encircled with a faint layer of icy mist.</p>

  <p>Calmly, she stepped onto the third disc.</p>

  <p>"Extreme Icy Zone."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng set his mind to rest upon hearing this. It was just as the cyan dragon had said. No matter how many dots Ning Yudie threw, she would suffer a punishment. Among these six steps alone, there were probably six different punishments waiting for her. Still, her luck could help her identify the easiest punishment.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not too aware of how difficult the Extreme Icy Zone was. It seemed a tough punishment for other warriors, but it couldn't be that hard for Ning Yudie. After all, she was a martial artist practicing cultivation methods of ice system.</p>

  <p>Yudie's figure was soon enveloped in layers of dazzling ice light. Luo Luo Zheng could hear the sound of ice crystals shattering due to the bright light. A few moments later, Ning Yudie finally walked out of the Extreme Icy Zone wearing a faint smile on her lips.</p>

  <p>"How do you feel?" Luo Luo Zheng asked her, a twinkle in his eye.</p>

  <p>"Not bad. I've comprehended a bit of the third layer of the Ice Law in the Extreme Icy Zone," Ning Yudie said, beaming at him.</p>

  <p>"The third level!" Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh. Ning Yudie was indeed highly talented. She had actually started to learn the third layer of Low Power As Ning Yudie walked out of the Extreme Icy Zone unscathed, the Holy Maiden's face betrayed a trace of disappointment. She had hoped that Ning Yudie would die in the penalty.</p>

  <p>While the Holy Maiden was lost in thought, the beam of light turned toward her again.</p>

  <p>"This is bad," the Holy Maiden whispered, knowing that she'd be in trouble.</p>

  <p>Her misfortune had not been resolved either. She would probably face a punishment after she threw the dice, but it remained to be seen if she had the strength or luck to survive this round.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden hesitated for long moments, waiting for the beam of light to turn red. She blinked and the dice was thrown up. When the dice returned to its original position, it stopped at four.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden's expression turned gloomy at once.</p>

  <p>Martial artists didn't believe in fate but they did believe in fortune. The number 'four' represented death. She felt like ominous dark clouds were gathering overhead.</p>

  <p>Four discs appeared at the feet of the Holy Maiden, the fourth one gleaming with black light.</p>

  <p>"I'm not aware of the relation between a color and the corresponding punishment, but I'm sure this round would be severe!"</p>

  <p>"The Holy Maiden of the divine kingdom is truly down on her luck. After being targeted such, she might even die!"</p>

  <p>"She has just reached the primary level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm, but she must have backup as she has brought so many Life and Death Realm warriors with her as bodyguards!"</p>

  <p>The martial artists from the divine kingdom were undoubtedly arrogant.</p>

  <p>Many of the Central Region ones were glad to witness the scene. If the Holy Maiden truly died here, it would be entertaining to them.</p>

  <p>The handsome man gritted his teeth, saying, "Dear, if you really can't face this, then use the protective treasure!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know." The Holy Maiden nodded, took two steps forward and stepped onto the black disc.</p>

  <p>"Dark Zone!"</p>

  <p>A thick black light began to blanket the Holy Maiden.</p>

  <p>Everyone's heart skipped beats at the name.</p>

  <p>Even Eddie, Simon, and the other Life and Death Realm warriors didn't have the confidence to face the Dark Zone. The Holy Maiden of the divine kingdom was only at the primary level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>Moreover, her cultivation had been suppressed, so it was very likely that she would die right here.</p>

  <p>Streaks of black light continued to circle the Holy Maiden, as if striking her from all sides.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the Holy Maiden of the divine kingdom won't be able to hold on for even nine seconds!"</p>

  <p>"The black light is similar to the legendary death ray. I wonder, is it actually the death ray?"</p>

  <p>"No matter what it is, you won't be able to tolerate it."</p>

  <p>Amidst the conversation in the crowd, the strength of the black light dimmed gradually, the situation seemingly easing up.</p>

  <p>"She must be dead," someone whispered.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, white light burst out from within the black.</p>

  <p>The sound of someone cackling wildly from behind the black light echoed around.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>The outburst of laughter was not threatening, but the surge of power behind it was something no one could disregard.</p>

  <p>Who on earth was laughing so brazenly?</p>

  <p>Countless beams of white light pierced through the black light surrounding the Holy Maiden. In the blink of an eye, the blaze of black light disappeared, leaving only the Holy Maiden standing on the disc. In the sky above her, a faint figure could be seen, now slowly ebbing away.</p>

  <p>By then, everyone present knew that the Holy Maiden could not confront the punishment, so she summoned the figure to help her. Still, they were oblivious to who this figure was and how it had destroyed the obstacle set by the immortal.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" the handsome man asked, concern echoing in his voice.</p>

  <p>The Holy Maiden had turned pale. She nodded, saying, "I'm fine, but I've used up the protective treasure."</p>

  <p>The handsome man's face whipped in Luo Zheng's direction, whom he stared at with a fierce expression. "It's all because of that guy!" he shouted. "He must pay the price for it with his blood!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the dice stopped at five. Hobbes, from the World Commercial Alliance, had been the one to throw it.</p>

  <p>The three stout heads of the World Commercial Alliance had all been quite lucky. Dillon had taken thirty steps, Hobbes thirty-three, while Haber had taken twenty-nine.</p>

  <p>Five discs appeared in front of Hobbes, and the fifth one was white.</p>

  <p>"White color? What does it indicate?" Hobbes was an impatient person. He stepped forward without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"You have an opportunity to disperse the negative effect on any person."</p>

  <p>The people of Cloud Hall and the divine kingdom looked on, their eyes shining with excitement.</p>

  <p>The damned calamity curse was indeed devastating. If the Dark Zone were to appear again, the Holy Maiden would certainly lose her life.</p>

  <p>The same was true for Ning Yudie. This time, she had been blessed enough to come out of the Extreme Icy Zone unharmed, but what about the next time?</p>

  <p>And the other times to come?</p>

  <p>Both the Holy Maiden and Ning Yudie had an urgent need to dispel their misfortunes.</p>

  <p>"Fatty, dispel our Holy Maiden's bad luck, right now!" the handsome man spat out, staring at Hobbes anxiously. He must have a screw loose somewhere!</p>

  <p>Tracing the voice to its owner, the crowd in the abyss looked at him like he was an idiot. Even the five Life and Death Realm elders behind him held contempt in their gazes.</p>

  <p>Hearing the insulting command, Hobbes laughed darkly. "Who the hell are you? And why should I bother chasing away your Holy Maiden's misfortune?"</p>
