  <p>
</p>

  <p>These human-shaped creatures, which were floating about, were like ghosts. The aura emitted by them was not very powerful.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what bad luck..." Aleyna pursed her lips when she saw these Time Ghosts.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong? These things seem to be quite weak," Zheng commented curiously.</p>

  <p>Zheng could conclude from the aura of the Time Ghosts that their strength was equivalent to that of ordinary evil ghosts, so it wouldn't be too difficult to kill them.</p>

  <p>"While it's true that these Time Ghosts aren't strong, their bodies are stuck in another time, so it is impossible for anyone to hurt them.</p>

  <p>Moreover, once you are possessed by a Time Ghost, it will drag you to the gap in time and rip you into two," said Aleyna. Evidently, she had prepared quite well for her trip to the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>This explained why the Time Sea had earned a reputation of being so horrible.</p>

  <p>The entire Time Sea was made up of countless broken time fragments.</p>

  <p>Each wave represented a different time period. This meant that if someone fell into the Time Sea, their body would fall into different times. If one compared time with space, the consequence of the fall was equivalent to their body being shredded apart by countless space cracks.</p>

  <p>However, the Time Law was much more domineering than space cracks.</p>

  <p>Zheng had been able to resist the space cracks long ago. Even though the space cracks in the divine land were more powerful than those in the universe where he was from, they were still incomparable to the time cracks. These so-called cracks were not actual cracks, but rather a concept, which formed when the time was split into different time periods.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, there were many mighty warriors among this group of True Gods. With so many top-rank True Gods and mid-rank True Gods present, naturally someone or the other would figure out a way. So Zheng was not worried.</p>

  <p>The group of True Gods, including Pascal discussed and debated for a while, and then someone stepped out.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this just a bunch of silly Time Ghosts? They are not particularly intelligent. I'll just draw them away." The one who spoke was a man with black hair, who looked very young, but was already a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Top-rank True Gods could fly in the forbidden area, but this place was filled with traps. They didn't dare to run around recklessly like the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Many True Gods were happy to hear the black haired young man's words. It was a good thing that someone had taken the initiative to lead the way.</p>

  <p>The black-haired young man walked up to the path and then he whipped out a small bamboo flute from his chest. He shook the flute gently, and many gold bits fell out of it. The gold bits turned out to be six or seven human-shaped puppets!</p>

  <p>Judging by the appearance of the puppets, they didn't seem extraordinary.</p>

  <p>However, after the black haired young man made a mysterious gesture, an invisible force spread out. When everyone present experienced this powerful force, they all had the illusion as if they had lost the control of themselves.</p>

  <p>"Great Manipulating Way?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>In the Arena of Legends, Zheng had experienced the same kind of power, but at that time, the one he had encountered was a low-rank True God, who was far from being as domineering as the black haired young man.</p>

  <p>Aleyna nodded. "He is Jolyon Fang from Fang Clan. He is obsessed with making puppets and has cultivated the Great Manipulating Way to a very high level. His puppets are also very powerful. Each puppet is as strong as a mid-rank True God! It is said that he has a very special puppet that can even kill top-rank True Gods!"</p>

  <p>Some of the Godly Ways appeared weak, but if one cultivated them and reached a very high level, they could also prove to be very powerful.</p>

  <p>When Jolyon Fang gave life to the puppets, an extremely strong aura emitted from the bodies of the puppets, which was stronger than that of a mid-rank True God! Were there strong souls hidden in the puppets? Or did Jolyon Fang use some special methods to give them such strong aura? Nobody knew the answers to these mysteries.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>The black haired young man pointed at the Time Ghosts, and the puppets immediately dashed towards them.</p>

  <p>"Bang, Bang, Bang!"</p>

  <p>The puppets produced metallic sounds as they ran, making a huge racket!</p>

  <p>One of the puppets waved its arm, and a circular quiver appeared under its arm. The quiver shot a number of golden arrows at the Time Ghosts.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish!"</p>

  <p>The puppets caught the attention of the Time Ghosts.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>Everyone felt a thundering in their ears. It was the cries of the Time Ghosts. They flew towards the golden puppets.</p>

  <p>Everybody was confused and impressed in equal parts at the way Jolyon Fang controlled the puppets. The puppets were as agile and responsive as if they were his own arms.</p>

  <p>When Jolyon Fang saw that the puppets had drawn the attention of all the Time Ghosts, his eyes flashed with excitement. With a sudden wave of his hand, the puppets suddenly turned around and rushed off in another direction.</p>

  <p>The Time Ghosts gathered at the place where the nine paths to the Time Sea Forbidden Land converged. Jolyon Fang led this group of Time Ghosts to another direction. However, in this process, a puppet, which was a little slower than the rest, was caught by a Time Ghost.</p>

  <p>Immediately Jolyon Fang lost control of this puppet.</p>

  <p>The puppet spun manically on the spot a few times and then got chopped into segments from its head to toe before crumbling to pieces and falling on the ground. The metal fragments scattered all over the ground.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, many of the True Gods' faces darkened. All the puppets that Jolyon Fang had sent out were created from the most sturdy materials in the divine land. But once they were seized by the Time Ghosts, they were actually so fragile.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>The Time Ghosts were very excited and kept pursuing the puppets. The road in front of them was clear.</p>

  <p>"Now! It is the right time!" Jolyon Fang yelled and bolted out.</p>

  <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>

  <p>The other True Gods also followed suit and sprinted out.</p>

  <p>"Thank god for Jolyon, otherwise, it would be very difficult to lure these Time Ghosts away..." said a True God, who had rushed in front of them.</p>

  <p>However, before he could complete his praise, his face darkened and he lost his words...</p>

  <p>A huge army of Time Ghosts had appeared again!</p>

  <p>"How come there are so many of them?"</p>

  <p>"It can't be that the first stage of the Time sea is so dangerous!"</p>

  <p>"Let's retreat!"</p>

  <p>Those who had the qualifications to enter the Time Sea Forbidden Land were the core disciples of the various rich clans. They were the elites of their respective Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The Time Sea Forbidden Land was dangerous, but these dangers were manageable. As long as they didn't break into the third stage of the Time Sea, they would be safe.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Holy Emperors were also willing to allow their children and disciples to enter the Time Sea in order to cultivate. After all, other than the divine might coins, they could also come across some pretty good opportunities.</p>

  <p>But this time, there were many Time Ghosts in the forbidden area, which caught the True Gods assembled there off guard.</p>

  <p>Defeating the Time Ghosts seemed liked an insurmountable task to some True Gods so they chose to retreat...</p>

  <p>However, just as they took a few steps back, they saw a group of Time Ghosts behind them. The Time Ghosts that were lured away by the puppets had already chopped up those puppets into pieces and were coming to surround them. All the True Gods were trapped in a dilemma as they had no way back.</p>

  <p>Aleyna's and Kelsey's faces turned ghastly pale. They didn't take the journey seriously, thinking that even if there were really any dangers, it would be thrilling and exciting. They had never thought that they might lose their lives here.</p>
