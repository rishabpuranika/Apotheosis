  <p>Yan looked at Grey's fallen body indifferently and without a single trace of sympathy. She immediately followed behind her older brother, Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Having left the Luo Clan a few years ago, she was not familiar with Grey. Yet, in her opinion, since her older brother killed him, he must not have been a good person.</p>

  <p>As Tristan passed by Grey, he spat on Grey's face and followed Luo Zheng as well.</p>

  <p>After a while, when Grey's twitching corpse had stilled, a murky vapor left his body and flew toward Luo Zheng. It was a malicious Mu Ning, the power of curse formed by someone who was unwilling to get killed.</p>

  <p>The more strength a living creature had, the heavier was the malicious Mu Ning formed on his death.</p>

  <p>An insignificant and weak figure like Grey had a small malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng wouldn't reject even such a small amount. The more malicious Mu Ning he absorbed, the higher his strength would be. Today, he was to kill all his enemies in the Luo Clan with the toughest means possible, which meant using his killing way of practicing.</p>

  <p>In the olden days, Zheng's father, Mike, had been much too good to his brothers out of a feeling of benevolence. Eventually, his two younger brothers, Bryson and Ken, murdered him.</p>

  <p>Although Mike had been soft-hearted and responded to evil with kindness, in the end, he still suffered the fatal disaster of getting killed.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had long decided never to follow his father's path.</p>

  <p>Stepping into the Luo house, they saw the wide muster station.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng left Luo Clan, he was forced to fight his younger cousin Andrew at the muster station while desperately seeking to stay alive.</p>

  <p>Yet, at the end of the fight, even when he beat Andrew, his uncle Ken didn't keep his promise that he would allow Luo Zheng to leave the Luo residence!</p>

  <p>The noise outside the front door had attracted the attention of the people in the house.</p>

  <p>Yet, since they were at a distance, they did not hear the conversation between Luo Zheng and Grey. They never suspected that outside the door were Luo Zheng and Yan, the two descendants who had left Luo house long time back.</p>

  <p>In any case, killing someone on the front doors of the Luo house was a mighty offense.</p>

  <p>"Who are you? How dare you kill our steward!" someone roared in anger. A couple of them drew their swords, pointing them at Luo Zheng and his companions.</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" Luo Zheng asked Tristan— who stood behind him— in an indifferent tone.</p>

  <p>"Group of thugs hired by Grey. Some family members of the Luo Clan protested because they were not satisfied with the family asset arrangement. So, Grey hired these people to threaten those members,"</p>

  <p>Tristan explained quickly.</p>

  <p>"Indeed," Luo Zheng said simply, nodding.</p>

  <p>The Streamer Sword Luo Zheng held glistened with a cold, silver flash of light.</p>

  <p>Whichever way he wielded the sword, this cold light flashed, splashing blood. Luo Zheng killed the thugs with no second thought. The strength of each thug lay in simple flesh-refining or bone-refining level. They didn't have the slightest advantage in front of Luo Zheng, and their skills offered them no resistance.</p>

  <p>Plop, plop…</p>

  <p>One by one, the thugs collapsed in a pool of blood.</p>

  <p>Not far away from the scene, some descendants of the Luo Clan watched Luo Zheng in horror. They wondered who sent this malefic killer. Was this the end of the Luo Clan?</p>

  <p>Desperate and eager to escape, they still did not dare make noise in fear of attracting Zheng's attention. Their legs felt like lead, so heavy that they were unable to move a single step.</p>

  <p>The terrible thought that it was the last day of the entire Luo clan flashed in their minds. They would get killed on the hands of this madman.</p>

  <p>Horror filled their insides slowly even as they fumbled, thinking on a plan of escape.</p>

  <p>But why was Tristan following this man and woman? Had he brought them here? Did he accompany the killer? The thoughts struck them unbidden. It was entirely possible that Tristan was an accomplice, judging from the way he stood close behind the killer.</p>

  <p>Just as the descendants worried about their fate, wondering who Luo Zheng was, Tristan announced in a firm voice, "Do not panic, my fellow members of the Luo Clan. He is Luo Zheng, our young master! As a matter of fact, he is the true master of our clan now!" Immediately, the crowd grew noisy, lost in a buzz of excitement.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng?" a member cried out in amazement.</p>

  <p>"He's Luo Zheng?" a second member repeated, startled.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng!" a third member yelled, sounding thrilled and happy.</p>

  <p>Despite the change in Zheng's temperament, they seemed to immediately recognize the young boy in him now that they were told his name.</p>

  <p>Like an old and long-lost friend that they hadn't seen in some time, Luo Zheng was in their faintest memories. Somehow, they couldn't remember him until his name came up, and then, the rich recollections surged up in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Of course, he is Luo Zheng!" another one of them recognized Luo Zheng, confirming this out loud.</p>

  <p>"Yes! He is our young master!"</p>

  <p>"No, he is the master of our clan now! He's the son of our former master, Mike. The eldest son of the eldest branch of the Luo Clan! Since Mike passed away, the leadership should pass down to Luo Zheng. He must become the new master of our clan!" The members of Luo Clan were astonished but thrilled to have Luo Zheng back.</p>

  <p>Moments before, they had been nervous and horrified, but now, their moods elevated from terror to joy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was back, and he had such great power! The Luo Clan was not to be destroyed. In fact, it was to be saved by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Luo Clan was slowly being ruined since Bryson, the current master of the Luo Clan, allowed those thugs to run amok inside the house. But they were still members of the Luo Clan, and none of them wanted to see their own family wasting away! It was the reason they did not want to leave the Luo Clan. They were born and brought up in this clan, which meant that their roots belonged here.</p>

  <p>Even if the roots were rotten to the core, they were still reluctant to leave. Yet, they could do nothing but swallow the pain as they watched the Luo Clan grow decadent slowly, crumbling away ceaselessly only to eventually be destroyed.</p>

  <p>But at this very moment, they understood.</p>
