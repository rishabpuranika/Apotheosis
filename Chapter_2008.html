  <p>
</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Blood-devouring Bone Arrow suddenly turned into a trail of blood and shot towards Yao below! The red streak made by the arrow flew with great precision.</p>

  <p>There was no way to dodge the arrow that Supreme Lord Leroy shot.</p>

  <p>The arrow could have followed Yao to the ends of the earth...</p>

  <p>Yao was well aware of the arrow's characteristics. However, she didn't dodge at all and continued to concentrate on the Profound Holy Thunder that she brewed.</p>

  <p>The Profound Holy Thunder that floated above Luo Zheng's head became more condensed than before. The Mu Ning it emitted also became even more immense as if a god of thunder was about to appear. Power, similar to a catastrophic thunderstorm, radiated from it.</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>The Blood-devouring Bone Arrow dragged a bloody light with it as it drilled through Yao's protective life vitality. With a powerful force, the arrow punctured her back.</p>

  <p>Swish?</p>

  <p>A blood-red flame followed the arrow towards Yao's wound and penetrated her body!</p>

  <p>It would burn away all the blood in Yao's body. Ultimately, it would even devour her soul.</p>

  <p>Yao maintained her upright posture as she stood bravely. Her entire body was stiff and unmoved. From her appearance, there didn't seem to be any change. However, the blood-colored flame was furiously burning inside her body...</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>On her chest suddenly surged a ray of red light. The heart was the place where the blood was the most concentrated in the body of a martial artist.</p>

  <p>When the blood flame reached that particular part of the body, the fire grew even more intense. It directly burned through her chest. The blood flame started to bloom like a rose. It swayed around her chest and radiated a bright red light.</p>

  <p>Additionally, red flames that burned furiously had also escaped out of Yao's arms, thighs, and even her back.</p>

  <p>However, she still held onto the hammer in her hand and maintained the same strong posture as before. She urged the descent of the Profound Holy Thunder as if her body wasn't being burned. Concentration and determination were reflected in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Leroy's eyes focused on Yao. A perplexed expression had appeared on his face.</p>

  <p>The intense heat from the blood flame was supposed to evaporate all the blood in Yao's body. However, she didn't show any signs of pain or struggle. Leroy felt confused as he witnessed a scene that was beyond common sense!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The crimson flame continued to burn even brighter...</p>

  <p>Not long after, all of Yao's clothes, skin, and hair were burnt entirely away. All that was left was a charred black skeleton that stood firmly on the spot. However, the skeleton still tightly grasped the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hand!</p>

  <p>The thunder vortex above Luo Zheng's head had yet to dissipate. Power still radiated from it.</p>

  <p>"This..."</p>

  <p>Leroy's eyes widened while his face was filled with disbelief. "How could this be?! What the hell happened?"</p>

  <p>After it heard Leroy's words, the charred skeleton even raised its skull and opened its jaws towards him. "Heh heh heh?" It gave out a spooky atmosphere. A strange sound echoed when the skeleton's jaws collided as if to mock Leroy...</p>

  <p>It made Leroy's hair stand on end. He had no idea what was wrong. Cold sweat trickled down his spine.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just him. Even Luo Luo Zheng, Supreme Lord Shadow, and Supreme Lord Korbin were shocked by the skeleton's actions. All of them had disturbed expressions on their faces?</p>

  <p>Soon, a feeling of realization appeared on Luo Zheng's face. He had encountered this kind of thing before, so naturally, he was able to recognize the scenario.</p>

  <p>"It's only a replica." Right at this moment, Yao's voice slowly drifted over. Coldness and arrogance were apparent in her tone. She reappeared in a blue dress and stood beside the skeleton, and took the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer from it.</p>

  <p>"It's Shania's ability," Luo Luo Zheng said faintly from within the vast pit. His eyes squinted with curiosity.</p>

  <p>The ability Yao used was the perfect Life Law. Only those who had taken on the Heavenly Destiny would be able to obtain it. However, Shania had actually comprehended it herself.</p>

  <p>When they were in the Illusion Battlefield, Shania had used this move to duplicate many Luo Zhengs. Those Luo Zhengs were no different from his original body, but the duplicates were unable to control the chaotic energy. The clones were only strong enough to be diversions.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, there was still a massive gap between a duplicate and the real Luo Luo Zheng when Shania used the technique.</p>

  <p>However, there was not even the slightest difference between the real Yao and her duplicate! It almost appeared and moved like it was the real Yao...</p>

  <p>After she heard Luo Zheng's words, Yao glanced at him faintly. "You're smart.</p>

  <p>What a pity?"</p>

  <p>She spoke in an arrogant tone. Then, she once again raised her head and met Leroy's eyes.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Leroy pulled out another Blood-devouring Bone Arrow from his body and nocked it onto the bowstring. He then locked at Yao, who was within his range.</p>

  <p>"You still won't admit defeat? Want to try again? Your efforts would remain futile." Yao faintly smiled. A conceited expression painted her face. "This arrow is indeed extraordinary, but you still have to pay a considerable price, right?"</p>

  <p>Once the Blood-devouring Bone Arrow hit the target, the power of the blood flame would be enough to kill even a Supreme Lord. It could murder any enemy that it hit.</p>

  <p>However, everything in the universe was in a balanced state. With such a powerful arrow, its usage would always be extremely costly for any warrior. One couldn't gain anything without an equivalent price.</p>

  <p>Rumble?</p>

  <p>The bowstring was once again drawn in a straight line. Leroy's eyes were focused on Yao. The second Blood-devouring Bone Arrow was about to be released!</p>

  <p>However, Leroy hesitated. He took some time to contemplate the use of another arrow?</p>

  <p>If the first Yao was a duplicate, then what about the one in front of him? She might have used the same trick twice.</p>

  <p>When he shot out the second arrow, it would once again burn away a third of his life energy. He would be left with only one last Blood-devouring Bone Arrow. If he shot out the third arrow, his life energy would be completely burnt away, and he would perish. As such was the price for the deadly Blood-devouring Bone Arrow?</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Leroy clenched his teeth and released the Blood-devouring Bone Arrow!</p>

  <p>Conviction appeared on his face as he let out a murderous howl.</p>

  <p>The arrow, however, was not aimed at Yao. It was targeted towards Ying on the other side.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The moment the second Blood-devouring Bone Arrow was shot out, Leroy seemed to have aged a lot. His Mu Ning became extremely weak, and all the hair on his body had fallen to the ground. His eyes grew dim and lifeless. Stench and wax decorated his skin while filth streamed out of his pores.</p>

  <p>At that moment, this Supreme Lord was amid the Five Aging Processes.</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord's lifespan was incomparably long. They possessed incredible vitality. Although Leroy was old, he still had at least tens of millions of years left. However, at that moment, he had already fallen into the Five Aging Processes.</p>

  <p>The Five Aging Processes were the limit for all living beings in the universe. All the living creatures tried their best to improve their cultivation so that they could have eternal life. Everyone was afraid of the Five Aging Processes.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that he hadn't expected this result, but he had no other choice!</p>

  <p>He decided to sacrifice his own life to achieve victory.</p>

  <p>When Ying saw the Blood-devouring Bone Arrow aimed towards her, she had a surprised look on her face. However, she remained unmoved and stood still. Not a single hint of panic was seen in her expression.</p>

  <p>As the Demon Night's Queen of Life, she was probably the most difficult one to kill. Her vitality outranked anyone in the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>If she used the Pool of Faith, she could provide a steady stream of powerful life energy. As long as the connection between her and the Pool of Faith was not severed, she would be an immortal existence. That was her power as the Queen of Life.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when Leroy had decided to fight, he had brought Luo Luo Zheng to the Rosy Cloud World in an attempt to destroy the Pools of Faith in the Inauguration Altar?</p>

  <p>Pfft!</p>

  <p>Just like Yao, Ying didn't dodge the arrow either. She even had an arrogant look before the arrow hit her.</p>

  <p>When the arrow hit her chest, the blood flame immediately started to burn furiously. However, she quickly pulled out the bone arrow and pointed at her wound with her finger. Suddenly, a blood-red vine grew out from the wound!</p>

  <p>The blood-colored vine was nourished with her own blood. It meant that her own blood also flowed within the vine. The blood flame used Ying's blood as fuel, which made it attracted to anything that had Ying's blood.</p>

  <p>When her blood flowed out along the bloody vine, the blood flame was immediately drawn to it and began to burn furiously along the vine.</p>

  <p>Ying intelligently guided the blood flame outside her body with the use of the blood-red vine.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>When the blood flame reached the top half of the vine, Ying gently tapped on it. The vine instantly broke and fell to the ground. A crispy sound could be heard as it disintegrated.</p>

  <p>After the blood-red vine was burnt entirely away, the bloody flame was extinguished in an instant. Ying remained unharmed despite Leroy's sacrifice?</p>

  <p>There was a faint smile on her haughty expression. She nodded towards Leroy and let out a sly smile. The extremely lethal Blood-devouring Bone Arrow was ineffective against her.</p>

  <p>A deep sense of powerlessness ran through Leroy's heart. Even after he sacrificed his own life, he wasn't able to do any damage to both of the queens.</p>

  <p>The two arrows that he released made his body look old. The worst part was that his mind had also begun to degenerate...</p>

  <p>If Supreme Lord Korbin wanted to kill him right then, Leroy wouldn't be able to resist at all. Fragile bones and weak muscles had rendered him helpless.</p>

  <p>His years of resistance had seemed like a joke. The failures of his sacrifices had left him without any nobility.</p>

  <p>However, Supreme Lord Korbin did not attack. Yao's attention was also no longer focused on Leroy. In their eyes, after Leroy shot out these two arrows, he was like a toothless tiger that had lost its ability to harm them. He was just an old man, soon to be dead.</p>

  <p>Yao felt that the condensation of the Profound Holy Thunder was almost done, so she smiled towards Luo Luo Zheng, "Now it's time to send you on your way." Hatred was apparent in her tone.</p>

  <p>Godly Geniuses all possessed heaven-defying fortune. It had been given explicitly to them by the universe itself. Therefore, Yao didn't relax her guard in the slightest. Vigilance was reflected in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Since she had already seized the opportunity, she had to get rid of Luo Luo Zheng. If he was out of her way, there wouldn't be any unnecessary troubles for her?</p>
