<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Something infinitely more complicated was taking place.</p>

  <p>Using the bloodline theurgy of the White Myth race, the Evil God was now trying to pull Luo Zheng into his own inner world. Since he had previously belonged in Luo Zheng's inner world, there would be no rejection between them.</p>

  <p>The Evil God would be able to pull Luo Zheng in with no problems.</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, the Evil God's inner world also belonged to Luo Zheng but, since he avoided the restraint of the Rebirth Land, Luo Zheng could no longer sense nor control him.</p>

  <p>Once pulled into the Evil God's inner world, Luo Zheng would then be at his mercy and might even get refined into an Inner-world Generating Avatar.</p>

  <p>Dorothy quickly sent him a message through life vitality. "Don't let yourself get pulled into the vortex!" she pleaded. "That leads to his inner world! If you get sucked in... You'll get trapped and end up in big trouble!"</p>

  <p>Her warning greatly alarmed Luo Zheng who now realized the true gravity of his situation. He immediately tried to distance himself from his opponent in order to avoid getting sucked into the vortex.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for him, just as he was about to move, a transparent film of light appeared out of nowhere and enveloped him like a net.</p>

  <p>"It's the Moon Spirit race's bloodline theurgy!"</p>

  <p>The sight was quite a shock for members of the Moon Spirit race in the core area.</p>

  <p>As a small race, most viewed their bloodline theurgy as useless and without value. However, it worked extremely well when the Evil God used it in combination with his other skills.</p>

  <p>There was no escaping the light film, it was airtight and could not be destroyed through physical means. There was also no way for Luo Zheng to use the Wing King's feather that he had been relying on to improve his bodily movement skill. Luo Zheng had no choice but to weakly struggle against the Evil God's three arms that were quickly pulling him towards the vortex.</p>

  <p>"I need to help him!"</p>

  <p>Yan exclaimed, unable to stand by the sidelines any longer. She stamped her foot and flew towards her brother.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just her. Dorothy and Feng Ge, without the slightest hesitation, also jumped into the air and followed after Yan.</p>

  <p>They had chosen to not get involved during the battle between the Evil God and Mount. One, they knew how powerful the Evil God was and going against him recklessly would be unwise, and two, it didn't really have anything to do with them. It was a different story now that Luo Zheng was the one in grave danger.</p>

  <p>However, just as they were about to join the battle, numerous four-legged, black snakes began to rain from the sky, turning into the Evil God's clones.</p>

  <p>These clones weren't as powerful as the real deal but they were still equally tough enemies. If not destroyed completely, they could respawn.</p>

  <p>The three women had to deal with these clones first before they could help Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Stop struggling!" the Evil God growled as he continued to pull Luo Zheng in. "We essentially have the same origin. If we can be completely integrated as one then it's only a matter of time before we conquer the entire world!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng scoffed, his eyes glinting with coldness as he glared at the Evil God who was now only a few inches away from him. "Do you really think that your little tricks will make me surrender?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God smiled. "Then why not show me those tricks you still have up your sleeve?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed and an indescribably strong aura began to emanate from his body. He reached out and touched the light film that had been wrapped around him.</p>

  <p>"Endless Restoring Method!"</p>

  <p>His recitation was immediately followed by a popping sound.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the light film that had previously enveloped him burst and dissipated like a soap bubble.</p>

  <p>When it burst, it turned into a handful of cyan liquid that splashed to the ground.</p>

  <p>"That's the Moon Spirit race's blood!"</p>

  <p>The members of the Moon Spirit race couldn't help but show their astonishment.</p>

  <p>They were a race whose members bled cyan. Though their bloodline theurgy wasn't powerful, the light film derived from their own blood was very difficult to destroy.</p>

  <p>Back in the cave outside the core area, not even the golden sharp sword released by the Divine Lair's demon woman could destroy it, yet Luo Zheng managed to break it with one gentle flick of his hand.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just that, he was also able to reduce it to its base form: the Moon Spirit race's blood. Just what sort of formidable method did he use?</p>

  <p>Even the Evil God was taken aback by this sudden turn of events, nonetheless, he wasn't going to give up so easily. When Luo Zheng broke the light film, the shadow of Snake Goddess behind the Evil God quickly mobilized, turning into multiple beams of energy.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was almost in the Evil God's grasp and there was no way he was letting him go. If he succeeded in taking Luo Zheng into his inner world then he would no longer have to worry about him anymore.</p>

  <p>Despite the beams of energy heading towards him, Luo Zheng chose to remain in his spot. Instead of running, he simply swept his hand across the air and waved the energy beams away.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The energy beam that touched Luo Zheng's hand quickly broke down and turned into a handful of red blood that also splashed to the ground.</p>

  <p>All the bloodline theurgies that the Evil God used on Luo Zheng broke down into the energy that formed them.</p>

  <p>Outside the black and white world, Mount finally healed that dreadful wound on his abdomen. It had been a nasty blow from the Evil God, one that nearly destroyed his inner world.</p>

  <p>As he continued to heal, he also paid attention to the battle currently taking place between Luo Zheng and the Evil God.</p>

  <p>Mount's eyes widened when he noticed the formidable technique Luo Zheng was using. "Is that... the Time Backing technique?" He squinted his eyes and tried to keep track of Luo Zheng's moves. "It doesn't look like it at all though."</p>

  <p>Mount could only shake his head in confusion.</p>

  <p>The light film of the Moon Spirit race and the shadow of the Snake Goddess were activated through those races' bloodlines. For those thuergies to have reverted to their original forms meant Luo Zheng used some type of formidable skill similar to the Time Backing technique.</p>

  <p>It wasn't possible though. The Time Law was restricted by the unshakeable truth.</p>

  <p>More importantly, the aura Luo Zheng emanated had nothing to do with the power of time. It felt more like a Truth of Godly Way, one that Mount had never seen before.</p>

  <p>He wasn't the only one confused.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, who was outside the Chaotic Source World, also sported an equally bewildered look on his face.</p>

  <p>He felt that it was increasingly becoming difficult to see through Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"The Truths of Divine Dao are known to be the paths that lead to the Other Shore. After the Truth of Powerful Holy Body was banned, only twelve remained. Luo Zheng's aura resembles a truth aura so much. Where exactly did he cultivate this new Truth of Godly Way? Or am I wrong?"</p>

  <p>He'd never witnessed such a strange phenomenon and thus didn't know what to make of it.</p>

  <p>There was no way for Fuxi to know how Luo Zheng learned such a method. The young man was gone for less than five minutes after being exiled by Mount so how did he learn so much in just a short period of time?</p>

  <p>Fuxi was the Human Sovereign, second only to the Chaos Ancient Gods.</p>

  <p>However, not even he knew all the secrets of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the battle between Luo Zheng and the Evil God continued on. Luo Zheng turned around and shot out a blue beam of light towards his opponent.</p>

  <p>Caught off-guard, the blue light pierced through the Evil God's body, leaving a hole in his chest.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for him, the flesh around his injury wriggled and quickly closed the hole.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's attack had been powerful but nowhere near enough to kill him.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng never expected to eliminate his opponent with one hit.</p>

  <p>Having delivered his attack, Luo Zheng took advantage of the Evil God's momentary shock and distanced himself from him.</p>

  <p>The golden opportunity for the Evil God to defeat his creator quickly slipped away. Luo Zheng had shown his trick and managed to turn the tables at the critical moment.</p>
