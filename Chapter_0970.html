  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everything happened so quickly. There were a few Ethereal City guards who were standing by the transmission array, but since they were only at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm, they were slow to react to what was happening.</p>

  <p>Destroying a transmission array wasn't something that would benefit a person, and it would be highly harmful to others. Because of that, under normal circumstances, no one would maliciously destroy one.</p>

  <p>When the others saw the two Internal Elixir Realm warriors throw out the purple black bead, they immediately retreated to the side. After that, they saw that the bead emitted a fine line of lightning in the transmission array.</p>

  <p>Then, the radiance of the lightning burst out, emitting an intense light as well as the power of space. At the same time, violent explosion rang out.</p>

  <p>Clap! Clap!</p>

  <p>At the moment of the ear-splitting explosion, the area around the transmission array was swallowed by the bright light. The warriors who were queuing up and the guards that were standing by the transmission array were instantly annihilated. They didn't even have the time to scream before they met their doom.</p>

  <p>"They have destroyed the transmission array!"</p>

  <p>"This is the Space and Thunder Bead! It contains the Thunder Law and the Space Law. It can completely destroy the space channel!"</p>

  <p>"Why did they destroy the transmission array? What is their goal?"</p>

  <p>The warriors who had a considerable distance from the site of explosion had already cried out in alarm, and had started to theorize what had happened.</p>

  <p>It wasn't easy to destroy a transmission array. Once it was built, the entire space channel would be very stable. Even if the base of the transmission array was destroyed, the space channel would not be damaged. All they needed to do was to rebuild the base.</p>

  <p>However, the Space and Thunder Bead was different. The transmission array was something that wouldn't be easily destroyed, but the said bead was specially designed for destroying it. The power of thunder and lightning contained within the bead would destroy its base. However, the worst thing about it was the power of space contained within it because it had the ability to mess up the space channel in the transmission array, and if that happened, the space channel could no longer be rebuilt.</p>

  <p>After the two Internal Elixir Realm warriors had succeeded, another transmission array leading to Oracle City, which was one mile away, was also destroyed. By then, the two ways leading to Cloudy City and Oracle City had been ruined.</p>

  <p>"What? What is going on?"</p>

  <p>"I think I understand! These people are most likely from the Heavenly Evil Sect!"</p>

  <p>"They destroyed transmission arrays, so that the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance won't be able to lend a helping hand. It's very likely that Eddie is about to launch an attack."</p>

  <p>It was only a matter of time before people started identifying the reason for the attacks.</p>

  <p>Ethereal City had already done its best to prepare for such scenarios in advance. The Ethereal Spirit Sect had sent many warriors to patrol Ethereal City. Normally, the warriors guarding transmission arrays would only be at the low levels of the Illuminating Soul Realm, but now, there were several more who were at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>If the Heavenly Evil Sect really wanted to take action, it was impossible for anyone to guard against and even stop them. Even if the Ethereal Spirit Sect sent their best warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm as a defense tactic, the Heavenly Evil Sect would still send their warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm in order to destroy the transmission arrays.</p>

  <p>After all, protecting something was much more difficult than destroying it.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Evil Sect was not planning an attack anymore - they had already begun.</p>

  <p>The Ethereal Spirit Sect was built on top of a tall mountain, right outside Ethereal City. Now, in the outside perimeters of the Ethereal Spirit Sect, a layer of faint purple light could be found. The thousands of runes inside the sect formed a circular rune of Eight Diagrams.</p>

  <p>This sect-protecting array was the work of Arnold. It was called the Illusory Array.</p>

  <p>Before the appearance of Luo Zheng's sect-protecting array, the Illusory Array had been the strongest sect-protecting array in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Outside of the sect-protecting array, tens of thousands of warriors were floating in the sky. Most of them had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm, and a small portion of them were at the Internal Elixir Realm. dozens belonged to the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>All these warriors wore long black robes, with two words embedded on their chests: Heavenly Evil.</p>

  <p>They were the Divine Kingdom Army of the Heavenly Evil Sect.</p>

  <p>While others called them the Heavenly Evil Sect, they called themselves the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>All the warriors in the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom used to be independent warriors.</p>

  <p>The world of warriors was immensely cruel. While other warriors had grown up in sects, independent warriors had to exert a far greater effort to survive. Moreover, they were often bullied by the sect disciples, so they all held a grudge against the great sects.</p>

  <p>The reason why Eddie was able to build his divine kingdom as smoothly as he did was that he knew exactly what these independent warriors thought. He claimed that he would unite all the independent warriors and overthrow all the small and large sects in the Central Region. After he built his divine kingdom, he would share the kingdom with independent warriors.</p>

  <p>And because of that, this had to be said - Eddie was really smart. He gave the independent warriors a space to vent their anger towards the sects, and he was able to give them what they wanted. Hence, in a short period of time, he had amassed a large number of followers.</p>

  <p>When other sects got wind of what was happening, they frantically began to try to stop the independent warriors.</p>

  <p>However, it was already too late. Eddie's Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom was growing at an extremely fast pace, and was quickly becoming the biggest power in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>On a grade perspective, the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom already had the qualifications to become a sixth-grade sect, just without Soul Sea Realm masters.</p>

  <p>But to be fair, it was not that easy to become a Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>Because of that, Eddie got stuck, and so he anxiously tried to find a third girl with a Purple Power Body to help him break through to the Soul Sea Realm. By then, his Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom would be worthy of its name.</p>

  <p>It was one of the reasons why Eddie wanted to attack the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, if he managed to destroy the Ethereal Spirit Sect, the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom's reputation would further spread. If that ever happened, the number of independent warriors who followed him would definitely multiply. Even the Cloud Hall and the World Commercial Alliance would not be able to stop them!</p>

  <p>"Warriors! The sect in front of us is the number one sect in the world, the Ethereal Spirit Sect! Did they bully you in the past?" Eddie roared, as he stood in front of the Divine Kingdom Army.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>There were over ten thousand warriors there, and even the weakest of them had reached the Illuminating Soul Realm. Their combined voices could easily shake the earth.</p>

  <p>Although the Ethereal Spirit Sect was the number one sect in the world, its influence hadn't spread throughout the Central Region. It was impossible that these independent warriors were all bullied by the sect.</p>

  <p>But as independent warriors, they were oppressed by sect warriors. For example, when exploring a dangerous land, independent warriors would often travel alone. At most, they would travel together in two or three, but sect warriors would usually have dozens of companions. Any time that the both of them stumbled upon a golden opportunity or treasure, independent warriors would always inevitably lose, and get nothing.</p>

  <p>It was just like that in the world of warriors. Whoever was the most powerful would keep the treasures for themselves. It was just the law of the jungle. If the independent warriors were in the sect warriors' position, they would undoubtedly do the same.</p>

  <p>As Eddie had fully raised the morale of the troops, none of them thought deeply about what Eddie really wanted.</p>

  <p>"Very good! Then today will be the day the Ethereal Spirit Sect is destroyed!" Eddie roared coldly.</p>

  <p>Just then, a figure flew out from the Divine Kingdom Army. It was a white-faced scholar-like man at the middle level of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.</p>

  <p>He held an ancient folding fan in his hand. As the folding fan unfurled, everyone saw the word "Darius" written on it.</p>

  <p>He was the military adviser of the Divine Kingdom Army. He used to be an independent warrior and was quite famous in the south of the Central Region. However, he had offended the people from the Mysterious Luna Hall, so his family was killed by them.</p>

  <p>Darius had stayed hidden all these years, and when he heard that Eddie was about to found a divine kingdom, he knew that his chance had come.</p>

  <p>From his point of view, whether Eddie could build a divine kingdom or not was not important. What was important was that he would be able to take advantage of Eddie's power to destroy the Mysterious Luna Hall. In a sense, both of them were using each other for their own personal gains.</p>

  <p>"I just received news that the young lady from the Xi Family is not in the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Instead, she is in Ethereal City," Darius said faintly.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Eddie's eyes narrowed. "It seems like Xander really doesn't take me seriously. Well, I think that means I should go to Ethereal City!"</p>

  <p>"The two transmission arrays in Ethereal City have already been destroyed. However, I'm afraid that the Xi Family prefers death over dishonor," Darius said.</p>

  <p>Eddie frowned, a cautious look on his face. Darius was right. The Xi Family wouldn't give him the girl with a Purple Power Body without an intense fight.</p>
