<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 402 The Legendary Jacques (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>After hearing those disturbing remarks, Jacques slowly walked to the edge of the battle ring, with his sharp eyes staring at Luo Luo Zheng, and loudly and firmly said, "I want to launch a challenge against you!"</p>

  <p>The dare made the audience sit up in attention. They didn't think Jacques could be so intense and straightforward. The disciples were merely comparing the two warriors and did not expect Jacques to issue a challenge to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Many of the spectators shared the same though. 'Luo Luo Zheng is at the second grade of nature level, while Jacques has broken through the Illuminating Soul Realm. Presumably, his strength will be superior among disciples with the strength of the same realm. But for him, to challenge Luo Luo Zheng is quite brazen and almost a form of bullying.'</p>

  <p>In a low voice, Master Wen said, "Luo Luo Zheng, don't say yes!"</p>

  <p>He was afraid to offend Jacques. Although he was a master of Drizzle Peak, Jacques' mentor was either a saint, or an elder, whose status was far higher than his.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng looked at Jacques without fear and dispassionately said,</p>

  <p>"Whether we fight or not, I follow Cloud Sect's arrangement. If according to the rules of All Peaks Competition, you and I are assigned to have a match, I will certainly not refuse."</p>

  <p>His tone and attitude riled Jacques. "Are you afraid? Ahhh, don't worry. I won't let anyone say I am trying to bully you because of my more superior power. I will adjust my strength to the nature level and fight you fairly!"</p>

  <p>He looked at Luo Luo Zheng squarely, determination and pride burning in his eyes.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Luo Luo Zheng burst out in laughter.</p>

  <p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" Jacques' words ignited his fighting spirit. Sharply, he jeered, "Me, afraid? Jacques, do you know what fairness is?</p>

  <p>I still stand by what I said previously. If we are to be assigned to the same match to fight each other, don't worry for my sake, or control your power because I promise to defeat you!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's pronouncements made the disciples of Drizzle Peak and all other peaks inhale sharply and hold their breath for several seconds.</p>

  <p>At the same time, tens of thousands of disciples sitting in front of the Picture Slab also took a deep breath. While these disciples only had a view of Jacques on the Picture Slab, Luo Zheng's words were delivered clearly, and everyone heard this.</p>

  <p>After Jacques challenged Luo Luo Zheng, no one expected Luo Luo Zheng to speak fearlessly or even say something as crazy as he did.</p>

  <p>After all, he was only at the second grade of nature level. How confident was he to speak that way to Jacques?</p>

  <p>But then Luo Luo Zheng had spit out the words already. As the saying goes, spilt water cannot be gathered again.</p>

  <p>Hearing Luo Zheng's words, an odd expression appeared in Jacques's face but soon vanished. Inhaling deeply, he replied, "All right! If you are not eliminated in the round-robin competition, we will have a chance to compete. But if you are eliminated before I can compete with you, you will not be qualified to play with me!"</p>

  <p>Pride and arrogance made Jacques lay down his condition. Everyone was aware that Jacques had competed against several personal disciples and emerged triumphantly. His remarks were meant to tell Luo Luo Zheng that he would never be defeated.</p>

  <p>The personal disciple had the right to be arrogant. After all, three years ago, he displayed his impressive fighting ability while at the second grade of nature level. At that time, however, Jacques also experienced a sense of powerlessness with his second-grade strength as he faced the masters of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Now he was equipped with the strength of Illuminating Soul Realm that previously gave him that sense of being powerless. So, it was only natural for him to feel confident about facing opponents with the same level as his.</p>

  <p>"Jacques!" A voice behind him boomed. "Please pay attention to the fact that your present opponent is me!"</p>

  <p>As Jacques was busy talking to Luo Luo Zheng, the man, with a low and serious voice, stood behind the personal disciple, his face gloomy.</p>

  <p>The man was no other than the famous Stanley Pu, Azure Peak's top disciple, at the same time, a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Among the 33 peaks, Azure Peak ranked fifth. This meant he was one of those possessing the most powerful strength, and as a top disciple of Azure Peak, Stanley was naturally proud and even arrogant.</p>

  <p>So it was infuriating that when Jacques stepped on the ring, he completely ignored Stanley's presence and instead went on to challenge someone at the second grade of nature level.</p>

  <p>To Stanley's mind, Jacques' behavior showed he had no regard for his present opponent at all, but rather saw Luo Luo Zheng, at only the second grade of nature level, as an adversary. So how could the arrogant Stanley take this kind of disrespect?</p>

  <p>Dick lost to Luo Luo Zheng, but Stanley was certain he would never lose to the Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>When Stanley's words finally penetrated Jacques' ears, he turned around, grinned and said, "You're my opponent?"</p>

  <p>"That's right!" Stanley nodded to acknowledge.</p>

  <p>As he prepared himself to face his opponent, Stanley reached out for a golden fan, a top grade spiritual weapon. It was an ordinary-looking object except that it stood out because the fan glowed with golden light.</p>

  <p>A layer of gold covered its surface, giving it a delicate and elegant appearance. Once it was unfolded, its edges became sharp as knives. A cut by the fan would be more painful than being sliced by a blade.</p>

  <p>"All right," Jacques said. Inhaling deeply, he suddenly walked towards Stanley.</p>

  <p>Although still annoyed for being ignored by Jacques, Stanley never let his guard down as he got ready to begin the match. In his mind, he acknowledged Jacques' reputation. With the strength only at the second grade of nature level, he challenged and defeated over half of the disciples on the Cloud Sect list. Now, with the strength of the Illuminating Soul Realm, the man was even more difficult to read.</p>

  <p>So Stanley chose to launch a pre-emptive strike. By tossing his gold fan lightly, he completely unfolded the fan, enabling him to wave it around him randomly.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh!" The sound of the fan whipping the air had everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>As Stanley's hand flipped the golden fan rapidly, one streak of life vitality after another was being released by the spiritual weapon at the same time.</p>

  <p>Stanley's life vitality was extremely special. He would always think of something very sharp so the life vitality pulled out by the golden fan did not transform into a particular object. Instead, it released a kind of gold thread as thin and fine as a hair strand. Had it not reflected a little golden light under the sun, it would have been hardly visible to the naked eye.</p>

  <p>Like everyone else, Luo Luo Zheng had his eyes wide open and glued to the battle ring, watching the match unfold. Once before, he experienced a similar attack. It was at the trial of Bloody Mountain, where Ryan used his spiritual weapon to draw out a kind of indestructible line of energy.</p>

  <p>During that test, Luo Luo Zheng suffered scratches all over his body from the thin lines of energy that struck him.</p>

  <p>Looking at the gold thread pulled out from Stanley's fan, Luo Luo Zheng saw it was more powerful than the thin lines that came out of Ryan's spiritual weapon. Everyone in the audience waited curiously at how Jacques would deal with this.</p>

  <p>And just as they began thinking of how the personal disciple would deal with the attack, Jacques simply walked towards the gold threads coming from Stanley's fan.</p>
