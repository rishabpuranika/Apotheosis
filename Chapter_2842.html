  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Isn't that Samuel's face?" The moment Tianming saw the huge head, he was astonished.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, it had already rushed close behind Rosie, threatening to swallow her.</p>

  <p>Rosie waved her arm and released the brown force of primitive fear, which turned into a huge pillar and blocked the jaws from snapping any further.</p>

  <p>Although the head was made of mere soil, its power was way over the limit.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>An explosion rang out, as the pillar was snapped into two. Then the head took Rosie into its mouth.</p>

  <p>"It's just a man made out of soil. Why should I be afraid of it?"</p>

  <p>There was no way Lorena would watch her sister being swallowed.</p>

  <p>She immediately jumped, as a red light sprang out from her hand and aimed at the head.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>The crimson light awl directly hit the middle of the head.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The light awl made a dull noise when it collided with the head.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a huge crack appeared in the head. Soon, half of the head was turned over, through which Rosie was able to escape.</p>

  <p>The head stopped moving, but a creepy laugh rang out.</p>

  <p>"Haha... Leave the True Demon Body here and I will let you go."</p>

  <p>It was Samuel's voice.</p>

  <p>"It is really Samuel!" Zheng's eyes were wide with shock.</p>

  <p>Lorena raised her eyebrows, as her sharp eyes gleamed. She sneered, "Do you think you can keep us with your little trick?"</p>

  <p>"Can't I? Hahaha, let's find out!" Samuel roared with laughter.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>The quiet Abyss Demon Region suddenly became alive.</p>

  <p>As the rumbling sound continued, they were stunned to see huge heads spring up one after another.</p>

  <p>The entrance to the Abyss Demon Region was through a vast plain. By now, thousands of huge heads had suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>These heads were squeezed together like large moving mountains, as they charged towards Zheng and the others.</p>

  <p>"This... This is truly astounding. What an incredible ability!" Rosie said, as she watched all this, agape; and then soon realized something. "I'm afraid the True Demon Body is not the key to controlling the Abyss Demon Region. That's why Zheng and Tianming were not able to control it. Until now, the Abyss Demon Region may have been controlled by Samuel."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed in confusion. "There is no way Samuel is able to control the Abyss Demon Region. I still remember that back then, Pascal... " Zheng said as he trailed off.</p>

  <p>When Nicholas employed Furnace of Dark and Light, Zheng didn't really bother about Pascal. He had assumed that he was sucked into the furnace and died.</p>

  <p>Tianming frowned and said, "Samuel secretly brought Pascal into his inner world. He could only use Pascal to control the Abyss Demon Region. That is why Samuel kept him alive."</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>Those heads rushed towards them. It sounded like herds of trampling elephants.</p>

  <p>"They are merely earthen heads. They can't possibly hurt us," said Lorena.</p>

  <p>She had no intention of retreating.</p>

  <p>She didn't want to leave her sister alone here. She planned to fight together as a team.</p>

  <p>Since she wouldn't budge, Zheng, Tianming and Sword Chen would not leave either.</p>

  <p>"If the Abyss Demon Region is really under Samuel's control, then it is difficult to defeat him! I'm not going to die! Trust me! Sister, it is best that you leave as soon as possible,"</p>

  <p>Rosie worriedly said.</p>

  <p>But Lorena would not move. The red light in her hand constantly blinked and the light awl was held tightly in her hand. She was ready to hit those huge heads.</p>

  <p>Rosie turned towards Samuel's replica. After receiving the orders from her, the replica pointed the spear horizontally and a space passageway appeared.</p>

  <p>Soon Lorena, Zheng and the others were forcefully taken to the transmission array.</p>

  <p>But Lorena had already made up her mind. She gritted her teeth and decided to charge again.</p>

  <p>"Samuel can sever the connection between the two forms of True Demon Body. Even if Zheng and Tianming are united, their strength won't be enough to bring down Samuel. Think about yourself. If not, consider for Zheng. Do you want him to die with you?" Rosie demanded of Lorena.</p>

  <p>Lorena was about to rush out, but she stopped in her tracks at her sister's words.</p>

  <p>She had every doubt about Samuel's capabilities and talents. But judging from the current situation, she had to reluctantly agree that he controlled the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>In fact, Samuel was yet to show his presence. Despite his absence, he was able to launch such a destructive attack. The situation would be unimaginable once he arrived.</p>

  <p>"But..." Lorena was totally dismayed, after she weighed the situation.</p>

  <p>She was reluctant to leave her sister alone to deal with Samuel.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that I am a monster now. There is no way I can die. I'll wait for you to come back," said Rosie calmly.</p>

  <p>Standing on tiptoe, she flew towards the giant heads, and soon disappeared in their midst.</p>

  <p>More heads were rushing towards the entrance.</p>

  <p>"We should leave," said Sword Chen urgently.</p>

  <p>They had to leave right away. That was the only choice they were left with.</p>

  <p>If they chose to stay, it would be evident to face death. The thing was, Rosie could come to life again after she died, but not the others.</p>

  <p>Lorena clenched her fists, as a sense of helplessness overtook her.</p>

  <p>Thinking of her son, she had no choice but to leave. She turned around and stepped into the transmission array.</p>

  <p>Before those huge heads came charging at them, a power of space flashed through the transmission array and enveloped everyone, quickly sending them into the space passageway.</p>

  <p>The moment they entered the space passageway, the heads managed to crush the transmission array.</p>

  <p>In the past few days, the Dongfang Clan, the Mu Clan, the Tang Clan, the Leng Clan, the Fang Clan, and all the other powerful clans that belonged to the alliance, were sitting tight with tension.</p>

  <p>The reason for their strain was that Nicholas' universe had been completely destroyed.</p>

  <p>The guards guarding the transmission array were also restless.</p>

  <p>If those rumors were to be believed, then their good days were coming to an end.</p>

  <p>The worst outcome was evident. If the Sword Clan and the Moon Clan joined their forces together, they would be able to turn upside down all the Floating Islands that belonged to the alliance.</p>

  <p>The clans' elders had also intimated the guards to pay close attention to the transmission arrays leading to the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack...</p>

  <p>A guard of the Tang Clan heard strange crackling sounds. He looked towards the source of the sounds and found that the sounds were coming from the transmission array leading to the Abyss Demon Region. Waves of space fluctuation spread out from the transmission array.</p>

  <p>"It's from the Abyss Demon Region. They are coming back! Go and inform the elders! Quick!" the guard shouted loudly, immediately attracting everyone's attention.</p>

  <p>However, the space fluctuation within this transmission array only lasted for a while before it shattered into pieces!</p>

  <p>The guards and some of the disciples were stunned to see the scene.</p>

  <p>The sound was not because someone had returned, but because the transmission array on the other end had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Someone has destroyed the transmission array on the other side!"</p>

  <p>"So, Holy Emperor won't be coming back?"</p>

  <p>This was not just happening to the Tang Clan. All the transmission arrays leading to the Abyss Demon Region on the Floating Islands were destroyed, including the clans outside the alliance of the rich and powerful clans. Even the Moon Clan and the Sword Clan were no exception.</p>
