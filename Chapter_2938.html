<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Mirror Shield was one of the most precious treasures that Chiyou possessed. Ordinary warriors at the Other Shore Realm could not break it at all.</p>

  <p>Soon after Clement realized this, he immediately swung his sword again, with an intention to kill Timotheus.</p>

  <p>"Clang!"</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Mirror Shield appeared again, shielding Timotheus. The shield blocked Clement's attack.</p>

  <p>Mike was the first to realize what just happened.</p>

  <p>As a Holy Being, Mike had known about the existence of the Heavenly Mirror Shield many years ago.</p>

  <p>However, he was clueless about its origin, until Lorena told him.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Mirror Shield seemed to be omnipresent at the surface of the divine land. Whenever the divine land was attacked, whichever the side, the shield was always present to protect the divine land.</p>

  <p>Some Holy Beings had closely studied the Heavenly Mirror Shield and even dreamt to possess it.</p>

  <p>But till date, nobody had even come close to achieving their dream.</p>

  <p>Only when the Heavenly Mirror Shield was activated, did Zheng's name cross Mike's mind.</p>

  <p>If Zheng indeed had merged with the original will of the divine land, then everything in the divine land should be under his control!</p>

  <p>"How could this be even possible?"</p>

  <p>Even Clement appeared anxious. He didn't look as calm or confident as he was before.</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>The silver moons in the Slaughtering Moonlight Array shot out beams with dazzling brilliance, as he constantly brandished his silver blood sword.</p>

  <p>Cling! Cling! Cling! Cling! Cling!</p>

  <p>No matter how hard he hacked at Ramzi who had lost his legs and fainted, or the members of the Snake Goddess race, the Heavenly Mirror Shield would always appear in time to block his fatal attacks.</p>

  <p>Timotheus, Emily, Mike and Leopold continued to look at Clement coldly, as they remained mum.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell is it?"</p>

  <p>Clement roared. The bloody sword in his hand was still controlling the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. Soon it unleashed streams of invisible force towards the Nine Li Guards and the others.</p>

  <p>"Clang! Clang! Clang!"</p>

  <p>All the violent attacks were blocked by the Heavenly Mirror Shield.</p>

  <p>His attacks went all in vain. Very soon, all of the divine crystals in the Slaughtering Moonlight Array were depleted.</p>

  <p>Emily narrowed her eyes, as she stared at him. Soon her expression cleared and smiled. The poor guy seemed to be in utter distress.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are you? Get out! Coward! This is villainous behavior!"</p>

  <p>Clement roared again.</p>

  <p>Not far away, Godfrey and the others, who were waiting for orders, also looked nervous.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a piercing scream suddenly rang out from the space channel behind Clement.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards turned their heads and looked over.</p>

  <p>"Abbas?"</p>

  <p>"What happened to him?"</p>

  <p>When Clement was controlling the Slaughtering Moonlight Array to attack his enemy, he ordered Abbas to continue to dig up the space channel. The miserable scream from the space channel signaled that someone might have killed Abbas in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards became even more nervous. Clement looked fierce. Just as he was about to take action, Godfrey, who was not far away, suddenly slipped and began to fall. The surface of the divine land cracked, creating a huge gap. A powerful force seemed to drag Godfrey down!</p>

  <p>Godfrey's face changed its expression. Just as he was about to fall into the crack, he immediately wanted to activate the Grand Teleportation to save himself from falling into the crack.</p>

  <p>However, just as he was about to formulate his strength, the invisible force soon engulfed him. He immediately discovered that he had lost connection with his inner world. How could he possibly display the Grand Teleportation in this situation?</p>

  <p>"Ah?"</p>

  <p>Godfrey shrieked one last time, before the crack closed.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!"</p>

  <p>Until some moments ago, the situation was clearly in his hand. How did the tables change all of a sudden? Clement wondered.</p>

  <p>Clement always considered every situation carefully before embarking on any kind of action. That was why, on his way to the divine land, he had communicated with Leyton, discussing everything in detail.</p>

  <p>Throughout the inside and the outside of the divine land, the only obstacles were the Nine Li Guards and the warriors from the Snake Goddess race. He was confident that the Slaughtering Moonlight Array would wipe them all at once. But now, what was going on? What was that person in the divine land? How could he kill Godfrey and Abbas in an instant?</p>

  <p>And most importantly, this person actually could control the Heavenly Mirror Shield!</p>

  <p>When they saw the current situation unfold, the Yellow Emperor Guards all rose to the air. They were all afraid that even they would be dragged into the divine land again.</p>

  <p>However, just as they were about to take action, a huge crack suddenly appeared on the surface of the divine land. The crack was thousands of miles long, like a monster's big mouth as it swept over in an attempt to swallow everyone.</p>

  <p>As Clement saw this, his face suddenly changed. He yelled, "Get out of here!"</p>

  <p>It was true that the divine land was important for Clement. However, he knew that when there is life, there is hope. If he reported this news back to his leader, he would also be valued. He had a premonition, that if he was trapped in the divine land, he would never be able to leave again.</p>

  <p>However, the speed at which the crack came to devour them was beyond his expectation. In the blink of an eye, the Yellow Emperor Guards, Nine Li Guards, all the others, and the Slaughtering Moonlight Array, were all instantly devoured.</p>

  <p>At this moment, all of them had fallen into the divine land. Or to be more precise, the Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>Right now, both the Heavenly Mirror Shield and the space barrier that separated the divine land from the outside world, were all under Zheng's control.</p>

  <p>Quickly, Clement and the other Yellow Emperor Guards used the Grand Teleportation, in an attempt to leave the divine land. The space channels that they created spread upward, and the Yellow Emperor Guards quickly entered inside the space channels.</p>

  <p>"Dong, Dong, Dong..."</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, these Yellow Emperor Guards stumbled out of the space channels. They all appeared to be in a very sorry state.</p>

  <p>All of them had bumped into the space barrier.</p>

  <p>If someone was trapped by the space barrier in the divine land, it was not so easy to leave. It would take several years to break the space barrier open. So now their mode of escape was completely blocked.</p>

  <p>"Don't panic!"</p>

  <p>Although Clement was at wit's end, he quickly adjusted his state of mind and managed to calm down the other Yellow Emperor Guards.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter whether you panic or not." A voice lightly floated over.</p>

  <p>Clement narrowed his eyes and found a young man floating in the void not far away from him. It was none other than Zheng. But Clement did not recognize him.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Clement asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Although he was trapped in the divine land, he still had the Slaughtering Moonlight Array. Truth to be told, it was the only thing that bolstered his confidence.</p>

  <p>But since this young man had dared to pull them into the divine land, he must have some kind of support system. In fact he must be the one who had controlled the Heavenly Mirror Shield.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter who I am..." Zheng slowly floated towards Clement and said, "What matters is that all of you are going to die here!"</p>

  <p>Previously, Clement had lashed out at Lorena. The scene had greatly frightened Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, his mother's life was threatened. If he had been one step late, he would have been parted from Lorena forever.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng managed to appear calm externally, his killing intent was madly surging in his heart.</p>

  <p>When Clement heard this, he was stunned. The words came from a mere True God. It was ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"It's you who will die today!"</p>

  <p>Clement raised the bloody sword in his hand in a casual manner. As the silver moons of the Slaughtering Moonlight Array shone brightly, an invisible force slashed towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>"Watch out, Zheng!" Lorena called out.</p>

  <p>She knew that Zheng never showed any kind of fear. Nevertheless, she was still worried about his safety.</p>

  <p>The power of Slaughtering Moonlight Array was invincible. Even the body of a warrior at the Other Shore Realm could be shredded into pieces in an instant. Powerful warriors like Emily and Timotheus would be no exception to this danger.</p>

  <p>However, the sword barely gave out a muffled sound when it struck Zheng's body. His body was complete, but ripples appeared on the surface of the Mountain of Holy Beings beside the Time Sea, which was millions of miles away.</p>

  <p>When Clement and the other Yellow Emperor Guards saw that Zheng appeared unharmed, all their hearts sank.</p>
