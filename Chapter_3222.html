  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ying and Concubine Yan were poker-faced.</p>

  <p>Everyone present knew that Natasha and Gethin were putting on a show.</p>

  <p>Only those who didn't know the truth might be deceived by their act.</p>

  <p>And whatever the reason, Luo Zheng had killed Marco.</p>

  <p>But Marco's death wasn't a loss to Gethin.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang couldn't stand it any longer. She interrupted Natasha and said,</p>

  <p>"Marco brought trouble upon himself. He deserved it. Some time ago on the Other Shore, Luo Zheng didn't want any enmity with him, but Marco attacked Luo Zheng with the intention of killing him. This time, Luo Zheng must have had no choice but to fight back and kill him."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew what Natasha was driving at. If he didn't fight back, others would think he was in the wrong.</p>

  <p>"Marco followed me all the way to the Clear Lake to try and kill me. He even lured me into the battle ring. Lady Natasha, it was fine you didn't stop your son from killing others, but no one was allowed to fight back? How is it reasonable?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Natasha's eyes flashed. She was trying to cover up the Vastness Mountain's guilt and Luo Zheng's cutting reply was exactly what she wanted. "No matter what Marco did, he was my son. Isn't it reasonable for me to take revenge for his death? I had no other choice but to bring you here. I wasn't expecting so many people to blame me!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cursed inwardly, 'You don't care about your son's life. All you want is the Truth Enlightenment.'</p>

  <p>Natasha's words did make sense.</p>

  <p>As a mother, she was furious but all she could do was bringing Luo Zheng to the Vastness Mountain. And she was justified in doing so.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe, Concubine Yan, and Ying were finding it difficult to find reasons for making a fuss about it.</p>

  <p>"Tit for tat. Marco wanted to kill Luo Zheng but Luo Zheng killed him instead. It is justified that Lady Natasha created problems for Luo Zheng as a way of revenge.</p>

  <p>But since Luo Zheng is fine at the moment, I think it would be better for us to let it go for now," Concubine Yan said, in an attempt to make the final judgment.</p>

  <p>Everyone present was intelligent and she knew that she couldn't get a satisfactory answer for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If Natasha continued to act the way she had so far, she would gain the upper hand. That was why Concubine Yan thought it better to put an end to this thing right away.</p>

  <p>Clasping his hands behind his back, Gethin sighed, "I didn't teach my son well, or else he wouldn't have been in trouble. I'm sorry for the trouble caused to you, Lady Concubine Yan, Madam Ying."</p>

  <p>Ying waved a hand at the golden throne. Ling Shuang helped her up and they both walked up to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang had told her all about Luo Zheng even when he was still in the divine land, but this was the first time that Ying had seen him.</p>

  <p>She looked Luo Zheng up and down with her old eyes, and her crumpled face relaxed as she said, "The first time I heard of you, you had just entered the Sea of Truth. Your cultivation base has increased at a very high speed. Am I right in saying that you will soon have the Indigo Soul?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng folded his hands in respect and bowed to Ying. "Yes, but it will take some more time," he said.</p>

  <p>One's Soul of Light gradually turned from brown to indigo purple as they continued to cultivate. Humans usually called it the Indigo Soul.</p>

  <p>After the Seven Mountains Meeting, Luo Zheng had once again gone to the temple and obtained some soul crystal. His Soul of Light was now emitting a faint purple light.</p>

  <p>Of late, Luo Zheng hadn't been to the Other Shore much and because of this, he hadn't made it to the next stage. Nobody knew his limits but it would be a while before his Soul of Light became an Indigo Soul.</p>

  <p>"I have prepared soul crystal for Dora to help her step into the Desire World. Looks like I need to prepare some for you as well," Ying said.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was confused.</p>

  <p>The soul crystal Ying had prepared would be more than enough to help Ling Shuang enter the Desire World. It must be a very big one and he thought it was inappropriate for him to accept such a gift.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng bowed to Ying once again and said, "It's very kind of you, Madam Ying, but I am in no hurry to practice."</p>

  <p>The old lady shook her head and said with a smile, "The Chaotic Source World is about to reopen. You can't miss such a good opportunity. I have two tickets, one for you, and the other for Dora. Only this way can I rest assured. Please don't refuse this."</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang said, "Luo Zheng, it will take ten years for the Chaotic Source World to open again. It doesn't matter if you miss out on it now but you will have to wait for ten more years for the next one. Don't refuse my grandma's kindness."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that one had to break through to the Chaotic Source Realm after entering the Desire World.</p>

  <p>That was a type of complete reinforcement for the corporeal body. Only after this reinforcement could one bear more Other Shore Power.</p>

  <p>But he didn't know how to do it.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang was right. The Chaotic Source World opened once in ten years and he couldn't miss such an opportunity.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan made her way to Luo Zheng's side and smiled as she said, "What a coincidence! My daughter Feng Ge is also planning to go to the Chaotic Source World. I have a lot of tickets. I can give you as many as you want.</p>

  <p>Besides, you don't need to take care of Feng Ge. She will be of help to you instead."</p>

  <p>What was going on? Concubine Yan was prepared to give Luo Zheng as many tickets as he wanted?</p>

  <p>Everyone was flabbergasted at this development.</p>

  <p>The tickets that Concubine Yan and Ying were talking about weren't extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source World complemented the Grand World Cultivation Method.</p>

  <p>Long long ago, when the creatures of the Source World had entered the Other Shore, they had, with time, gradually discovered many powerful Other Shore Tokens. They had thus greatly increased their power of control.</p>

  <p>But their strength reached a limit, which was about 1, 000 Jun, and caused their physical bodies to be limited as well.</p>

  <p>Only a small number of powerful nonhuman creatures could exceed this limit while creatures of most races came to a halt.</p>

  <p>No creature since the middle ages had been able to break through this limit.</p>

  <p>Some masters had stepped into higher stages of the Other Shore. The power of their Other Shore Tokens could reach thousands or even tens of thousands of Jun. But they could only use up to a thousand Jun of Other Shore Power when they fought.</p>

  <p>That was why the Other Shore Tokens of descending type were their best options. They didn't need the warriors' bodies to bear their power and so, the Other Shore Power that the warriors released would be far beyond the limit of their bodies.</p>

  <p>However, the Other Shore Tokens of the strengthening type, auxiliary type, and mysterious type were excellent. It was a great waste to just put them aside.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess had later discovered a special method on the Other Shore that could greatly increase the strength of the body.</p>
