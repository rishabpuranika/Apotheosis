<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 582 The Treasure Key (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"Are you referring to the girl named Tia? Well, I noticed her ever since you entered the Death Road. When compared to you, her strength is immense and extreme. But despite this she must want your help, as she led you to fall from the floating stone along with her," the cyan dragon said in a prophetic manner.</p>

  <p>"What I truly want to know is why and how did she come to be so strong." This was now the greatest mystery in Luo Zheng's heart, leaving it in a knot weighing him down like an anchor. Why was she so strong as she had just reached the Illuminating Soul Realm?</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon thought for a long moment before composing his thoughts and saying, "In my opinion, it's likely that she has practised some unique cultivation methods, such as Nine Spirit Returning Cultivation or Twelve Turns Penancing Cultivation. In fact, it's not at all likely that she has just reached the Illuminating Soul Realm."</p>

  <p>"Really? If that is the case, then how did she enter the Cloud Road?"</p>

  <p>Raising his eyebrows, Luo Luo Zheng reckoned that it didn't make sense logically.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon smiled humbly and said, "This kind of cultivation methods is so powerful that she has to practice anew repeatedly. For example, Nine Spirit Returning Cultivation requires the practitioner to give up his powers, which are brought by his practice, nine times. And he must restart from low level each time with equal rigor and determination. The practitioner will make a radical breakthrough only after that. It seems not to be the first time she has reached this cultivation level. So, her real level may be the later stage of the Internal Elixir Realm, or even a higher level."</p>

  <p>The words shocked Luo Luo Zheng so much. The later stage of the Internal Elixir Realm? Even higher level? Was her real level actually possibly that high?</p>

  <p>"This kind of cultivation method is powerful enough to be equal to anything. Once one completes all the practices, his strength would be well over the power of people of the same level. However, each cultivation method requires different boundary conditions to restart. So, I can't know her real level. Although her level has fallen to the Illuminating Soul Realm, her experience, insight, and power are well beyond the usual younger generations, including you. It is not a surprise that she saw through your swordsmanship and destroyed it without even using an actual weapon," said the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>After hearing the cyan dragon's words, Luo Luo Zheng looked at Tia's lightsome back in awe and admiration. Her level seemed to be higher than that of Elder Fei of the Cloud Hall. Then why on earth did she enter the Cloud Road?</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng made blind and disorderly conjectures behind Tia. At the very same moment, Tia was searching for something in the dim light. After a moment of vigorous hunting, she found out mechanism in the corner.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, she pressed on it and injected a life vitality.</p>

  <p>The entire life vitality flowed rapidly along the lines of the mechanism in a symmetrical manner. And soon, the whole interior world of the flood dragon was lit up bright.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng raised his head, he saw the whole world inside the flood dragon. As the cyan dragon said, the flood dragon had been transformed.</p>

  <p>The world now looked like a small palace.</p>

  <p>After Tia lit up the world, she looked around and said to Luo Luo Zheng, "You, follow me!"</p>

  <p>So Luo Luo Zheng followed Tia's footsteps. Both of them suddenly heard a "click" sound just after walking a distance. It seemed that they had opened a mechanism. On both sides of the walls, six small doors opened, from which six dark golden snakes slowly crawled out!</p>

  <p>The metallic sheen on these six small yet intimidating snakes was the same as that of the puppet killer whom Luo Luo Zheng had encountered in the hidden test. The materials used for making them must include the same metal.</p>

  <p>This shimmering metal was much harder than Luo Zheng's Streamer Sword.</p>

  <p>There was no way for Luo Luo Zheng to destroy this metal with his current level of cultivation and he knew his bounds well.</p>

  <p>However, with the broken flying knife's sharpness, Luo Luo Zheng was confident about cutting through the metal. But he had no intentions of using it, when he was on the Cloud Road.</p>

  <p>As soon as the six snakes appeared, they opened their metal mouths, revealing their dark golden teeth which in a dark twisted manner were appealing. And they rapidly catapulted themselves toward Luo Luo Zheng and Tia with strong force.</p>

  <p>"Ding! Ding!" Luo Luo Zheng instantly drew out his Blood Drinking Sword as his Streamer Sword was broken by the puppet killer and smashed the two puppet snakes. But even though they fell to the ground as their momentum was broken, they were not hurt at all. As Luo Luo Zheng was trying to find a way to destroy the puppet snakes, Tia reached out with one of her hands and caught a puppet snake. Then there was a flash of the life vitality in her hand. She had already torn the puppet snake into two with a slight twist of her wrist.</p>

  <p>"Wow!" Luo Luo Zheng was shocked by her power, which made his heart beat rapidly and muscle tremble. What an immensely horrifying strength!</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had just seen a fraction of the special kind of life vitality she possessed in her hand, her strength was obviously not weak even when considered without the help of the life vitality.</p>

  <p>Now, there was nothing to do but follow Tia. The remaining several puppet snakes too were grabbed by her bare hands in a similar manner as she tore each snake apart into two pieces and threw them away. It looked like she was tearing into noodles, seamlessly.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grew happy as he saw Tia throwing the puppet snakes away one-by-one. It was not only the materials of these puppet snakes alone that had a high value. It was the manufacturing engineering too that added to its high value.</p>

  <p>When Tia saw Luo Luo Zheng collecting all of the puppet snakes, she gave him a scornful look. "You don't have to collect them. If you help me reach my goal, they will hold no value."</p>
