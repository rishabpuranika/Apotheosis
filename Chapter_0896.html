<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Since the ogres had been expelled from the Tower of Sin, it was time to redistribute the seats.</p>

  <p>Previously, the ogres had occupied twenty-six seats, so how would these seats be allocated?</p>

  <p>Every race's seat owners had their own plans in mind.</p>

  <p>At the same time, they also knew that Luo Zheng would distribute the twenty-six seats as he pleased.</p>

  <p>According to the current situation, Luo Zheng only had to take the Demon Night into consideration. After all, the Purple Heart Sacred Place was actually under the protection of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. If the Demon Night hadn't protected the humans, the ogres would have wiped out the Purple Heart Sacred Place from the Sea God Continent.</p>

  <p>Although the Tower of Sin was important, a sacred place required decades, centuries, or even millennia of accumulation to truly rise in power.</p>

  <p>So, the seat owners of the other races estimated that out of the twenty-six seats, some of them would be allocated to the Demon Night while the rest would be allocated to the humans.</p>

  <p>Anyway, as long as Luo Zheng didn't take away their seats, they would be thankful to him.</p>

  <p>The top-level war lords slowly gathered in the round hall and looked at Luo Zheng with a complex expression in their eyes. Each of them had their own thoughts.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that the person who would reformulate the rules would be a human war general?</p>

  <p>Back then, in order to get a seat, every race had to go all out, even at the cost of their lives. However, the human war general had driven the ogres out of the Tower of Sin and obtained twenty-six seats in one go.</p>

  <p>Many of the top-level war lords admired Luo Zheng very much. What he had done was beyond their expectations.</p>

  <p>On top of that, Luo Zheng, with his current abilities, could expel all the races from the tower, including the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Of course, he wouldn't do that.</p>

  <p>There wasn't much benefit for him in chasing the other races out of the Tower of Sin. Besides, although the Tower of Sin was important, the development of the sacred places was more important. With the skin gone, what can the hair attach itself to? Everyone took the Tower of Sin seriously because it was important for the development of their own race's sacred place.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng turned the human race against all the other races, then the other sacred places would join forces to wipe out the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had also considered the rules of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>In fact, after so many years of evolution, the current set of rules wasn't bad.</p>

  <p>Any creature that entered the Tower of Sin had to constantly tiptoe around the edge of life and death. Only the true elites could climb up the floors one after another.</p>

  <p>Powerful warriors could obtain more resources, Lucky Light, and points.</p>

  <p>The weaker ones would be eliminated and might even become nutrients of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The Tower of Sin was just a microcosm of the world of warriors.</p>

  <p>"How will the rules change?" asked a top-level war lord of the Giants.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng smiled. "The rules from the first floor to the fourteenth floor will remain the same."</p>

  <p>"And then?" asked a top-level war lord of the Orcs.</p>

  <p>The rules of the first to fourteenth floors did not affect the seat owners. The top-level war lords didn't care about this.</p>

  <p>The most critical point was how to allocate seats on the fifteenth floor.</p>

  <p>What did Luo Zheng want to do? Did he want to give all the seats to the humans?</p>

  <p>Or did he want to keep the current rules? This was what they were most concerned about.</p>

  <p>"I've decided to leave all the seats on the fifteenth floor as they are. But since I was the one who drove the ogres away, I can freely distribute their twenty-six seats," Luo Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>These words immediately made quite a few of the top-level war lords heave a sigh of relief. It looked like Luo Zheng wasn't as domineering as they'd thought he was.</p>

  <p>Although these top-level war lords had obtained a lot of information on Luo Zheng, they'd been afraid that he would turn out to be more tyrannical than the ogres. But from his words, it seemed that he wouldn't take away the seats of the current top-level war lords. But Luo Zheng hadn't finished his words, so the other creatures were still a little worried.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng paused for a moment before continuing, "There's another point. The seats of the human race and the Demon Night will be permanently occupied and can't be taken away by any other race!"</p>

  <p>"Permanent seats?"</p>

  <p>"Does this mean that the human race and the Demon Night will always occupy their seats in the future?"</p>

  <p>"This is too..."</p>

  <p>The 128 seats on the fifteen floor weren't fixed. Every now and then, the seat owners would have to compete against each other for the rankings. The weaker seat owners would lose their seats to the newly promoted top-level war lords.</p>

  <p>In reality, the establishment of this rule had been biased toward powerful races from the very beginning. After all, the ogres and the Demon Night were the races that produced the most talents.</p>

  <p>Since they were the most powerful races, they had always controlled the most seats.</p>

  <p>This had created a system where the strong grew stronger and the weak grew weaker.</p>

  <p>Although the human race had been developing for so many years, only four humans were seat owners. Moreover, these four seat owners weren't very reliable either. It wouldn't be surprising if they lost their seats in the next competition between seat owners.</p>

  <p>In the past, during the worst times of the human race, they hadn't even had one seat. Now that they had four seats, the humans were pretty proud of their achievement.</p>

  <p>But if the rule of permanent seats was established, then the humans and the Demon Night wouldn't have to participate in the competition for seats and their number of seats wouldn't decrease at all.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had thought long and hard about this.</p>

  <p>He knew that even if he changed the situation of the human race and the Purple Heart Sacred Place by increasing the number of human seat owners, it wouldn't be a permanent solution. He didn't have that much time to stay in the Tower of Sin. After obtaining the inheritance in the tower, he was going to return to the Central Region.</p>

  <p>Many people were waiting for him there, including the most important person in Zheng's life.</p>

  <p>He might stay in the Tower of Sin for several months or a year. Three years at most.</p>

  <p>The Purple Heart Sacred Place wouldn't be able to develop and rise in such a short amount of time. Once he left, perhaps the Demon Night would take care of the human race for Xun's sake. But hoping that the humans would be able to rise to the level of the Demon Night would just be wishful thinking.</p>

  <p>That was why Luo Zheng had decided to establish the rule of permanent seats, which would at least ensure that the number of seats held by the human race wouldn't decrease.</p>

  <p>More importantly, the Demon Night would have permanent seats as well.</p>

  <p>This was equivalent to tying the human race together with the Demon Night. If the other races became unhappy with the rule of permanent seats in the future, they would first have to stand against the Demon Night. At that time, the Demon Night would be the first one to rush out and consolidate their permanent seats.</p>

  <p>This was Zheng's plan.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is no need for humans and the Demon Night to compete for the seats. This rule has both advantages and disadvantages for all parties involved. The disadvantage for the other races is that they won't be able to compete for permanent races. But the advantage is that the human race and the Demon Night won't be able to get additional seats in the future," Luo Zheng said slowly.</p>

  <p>Right now, there were twenty-six seats that needed to be redistributed. If all of them were given to the human race, then the human race would have thirty seats, which would be more than enough.</p>

  <p>"Is there anyone who objects?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The other top-level war lords stayed silent as they knew that it would be useless to say anything. Moreover, what Luo Zheng had said made sense. Now, the Demon Night and the human race combined would have almost fifty seats, so the remaining seventy-odd seats would be allocated to the other races.</p>

  <p>The situation was similar to when the ogres had been present.</p>

  <p>At that time, the other races had been worried about the continued expansion of the power of the ogres and the Demon Night. It had been obvious that the Demon Night and the ogres would keep obtaining more and more seats while the seats of the other races decreased. In the end, all the seats would have fallen into the hands of the ogres and the Demon Night.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng's new rule would put a stop to the expansion of the Demon Night because the number of seats held by the humans and the Demon Night would always remain the same. This wasn't a bad thing for the other races.</p>

  <p>"No objections."</p>

  <p>"I have no objections either." The other races all nodded.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng wasn't asking for their consent at all.</p>

  <p>Out of the twenty-six seats of the ogres, Luo Zheng allocated eight to the Demon Night. As a result, the Demon Night now had twenty-four seats while the humans had twenty-two seats, becoming the second strongest power in the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>As for how Esther and Fabian planned to allocate these seats, Luo Zheng didn't see any need to interfere in it.</p>

  <p>Esther was quite calm. Although having eight extra seats was a good thing for the Demon Night, it wasn't enough to make her feel excited.</p>

  <p>However, it was a different story for the four human seat owners. Fabian and Jarrod seemed to be on cloud nine as they had suddenly gained eighteen seats. How would they distribute them?</p>
