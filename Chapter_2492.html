  <p>
</p>

  <p>Tension filled the air.</p>

  <p>"This is the aura of a real powerful warrior at the Other Shore Realm!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng declared as he stared blankly at Harper.</p>

  <p>Known as a powerful master, Harper's gaze alone could push anyone into fear or even submission.</p>

  <p>He raised his sword, laid it flat slowly, and then pointed its tip towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Leave the masters in the Source World aside first. Some of the masters who hide in the divine land are more powerful than me. Are you brave enough to resist them? Or are you brave enough to resist me?"</p>

  <p>There was no time for responses as the aura of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice immediately covered Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was known that the aura of a True God was so strong that it made people feel that it was actually real.</p>

  <p>Harper's aura, however, was truly real.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng appeared as if he was wrapped in a crystalline layer of water. The layer of water looked deceptively soft, but it was quite strong.</p>

  <p>For a moment he seemed to fall into the winter, but in the next, it looked like he sank to the depths of the roaring flames.</p>

  <p>It went on for a while, and the two sensations alternately tortured the life out of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In reality, his current situation was a test.</p>

  <p>Based on Harper's facial expression, he could tell that he really did not want to hand over the Shadow Bearing Sword to him.</p>

  <p>Even if Chiyou was his grandfather, Harper still refused to give him the sword--at least for now.</p>

  <p>It was because there was something that Harper still wanted to verify.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Zheng, he couldn't do anything but do his best to resist Harper's powerful aura even if it was almost killing him.</p>

  <p>His face quickly became white as a sheet while his soul trembled constantly. Even his heart was shaking.</p>

  <p>Lorena and Yan didn't look too good either, especially Yan.</p>

  <p>"Mother, Luo Zheng is just a low-rank True God. His soul isn't weaker than mine, but he can't resist such an aura," Yan said anxiously.</p>

  <p>Since she was under Lorena's protection, she didn't have to undergo such a thing.</p>

  <p>Yet, Lorena just frowned and said nothing.</p>

  <p>It was true that she could help Luo Zheng make those requests, but she knew that there were some difficulties that he had to face by himself.</p>

  <p>If he couldn't even pass this small test, then there was no point for her to help him too much.</p>

  <p>After all, they were in a world where strength decided everything.</p>

  <p>No matter how good the chance, the powerful the patron, and how strong the foundation, all of those were simply additional reinforcements.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had to progress step by step with his own strength.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Lorena coldly ignored Yan's worry and turned to Luo Zheng. 'Come on Luo Zheng, ' she thought.</p>

  <p>"This man is so powerful! No wonder he has never taken the Holy Beings seriously.</p>

  <p>His power really is one level stronger than that of the Holy Beings!</p>

  <p>But? I'm sure I can make it through!" Luo Zheng choked out.</p>

  <p>He suddenly closed his eyes and began to quietly activate the Truth of Cultivation Nature.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Cultivation Nature!"</p>

  <p>Harper was a powerful man at the Other Shore Realm, so it was clear that his understanding of the Truth of Divine Dao was not something that Luo Zheng could comprehend.</p>

  <p>After all, he had used the Truth of Goodwill and Malice to cross the Sea of Truth and reached the other shore.</p>

  <p>The only thing was, Luo Zheng hadn't completely grasped the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it was impossible for Harper to use all the Truth of Divine Dao to test Luo Zheng. He knew when to stop.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Cultivation Nature is to take advantage of the situation and conform to the changes in everything in a natural way."</p>

  <p>In essence, the Truth of Goodwill and Malice was about the constant alternation of two kinds of auras. All that Luo Zheng had to do was follow the rhythm of the alternation.</p>

  <p>He had once experienced such a feeling from the cyan stone tablet.</p>

  <p>Still, the pressure at that time was far less powerful than it was now.</p>

  <p>Of course, both situations were quite different. His goal on the cyan stone tablet was to climb to a greater height, while as for now he needed to resist. He continued to do so when something suddenly clicked in his brain.</p>

  <p>"No, I shouldn't resist, but adapt."</p>

  <p>The power of the Truth of Goodwill and Malice constantly poured into him like two completely different torrents.</p>

  <p>In turn, he himself also changed with the torrents.</p>

  <p>"Look! Luo Zheng's aura has become so unique!" Yan exclaimed as she stared at her brother in shock. Beside her was Lorena, who was equally surprised.</p>

  <p>"He can adapt himself completely in such a short time!" she beamed with pride.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng wasn't strong enough to resist the torrents, then he learned how to swim in them to avoid being drowned.</p>

  <p>Like a baby in water, he learned how to tread the torrents after a bit of struggling.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he opened his eyes again.</p>

  <p>He turned to Harper and gazed steadily at him.</p>

  <p>"I have never lost my courage. I once fought powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm and the Supreme Lords in the universe. I even fought the Holy Beings in the divine land. You may be very powerful, but time will fill in the gap between us. And, I believe that..."</p>

  <p>"You believe what?" Harper interjected.</p>

  <p>There was a trace of admiration in his old eyes when he heard Luo Zheng's clear and determined words.</p>

  <p>"I believe that it won't be too long," Luo Zheng finished with a smile.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the aura around him immediately disappeared.</p>

  <p>Harper looked at Lorena and smiled. "Amazing. You didn't teach Luo Zheng, but his heart is so strong. Mike has done a good job!" he applauded.</p>

  <p>He had seen his fair share of miscreants in his long life.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he had more experience in the Nine Li race than Lorena.</p>

  <p>Even in the Source World, there were only few young men who had such a strong will.</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, Harper gently tossed the bronze long sword to Luo Zheng and asked, "I want to know how your father trained you."</p>

  <p>Lorena's ears perked up as even she was quite interested in this question.</p>

  <p>As both Luo Zheng and Yan were sent to the universe, Lorena did not know what had transpired there.</p>

  <p>She only guessed that Luo Zheng would have all the resources from Mike.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a heavy feeling washed over Luo Zheng as he took the Shadow Bearing Sword in Harper's hand. The sword was about as heavy as the Great Weighty Sword.</p>

  <p>A gentle smile spread across his face. He had experienced so many transformations in his life, but he didn't answer.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng has experienced a lot," Yan muttered solemnly as she looked at her brother. She was the one who understood Luo Zheng's struggles in the past the most.</p>

  <p>After Harold had taken her to the divine land and when she had learned the truth, she also felt that her father had gone too far.</p>

  <p>It could be said that Mike had used all kinds of methods to push Luo Zheng to the edge of life and death and to squeeze every inch of his strength and courage.</p>

  <p>Lorena learned from Yan that Mike had organized a relentless family, where Luo Zheng was tormented. "My husband was too cruel! How could he treat his son like that?" she lamented.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, Mike is really heartless!" Harper chuckled and sighed. "Because of such training, Luo Zheng's will is stronger than anyone else's. He is not only stronger than the members of the wealthy clans in the divine land, I'm afraid that even I am inferior to Luo Zheng in some ways."</p>

  <p>Truly, will had nothing to do with strength.</p>

  <p>The reason Harper had been slacking was that his mood had changed.</p>

  <p>After he lost his confidence, he became hopeless, simply watched the divine land fall apart and did not offer to help.</p>

  <p>Now, the confident young man in front of him changed his mind.</p>
