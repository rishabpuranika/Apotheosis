<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3656 Cooperation Of Two Races </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Gethin and Natasha seemed highly imposing when they arrived at the Azure Array so spectacularly.</p>

  <p>With the strength of the Vastness Mountain in cooperation with the Jin Wu, bringing the Azure Mountain under their control was supposedly easy.</p>

  <p>But seeing Pearce and Auden came as a surprise to Gethin? he hadn't ever expected the Taiyi Mountain people all to be there.</p>

  <p>With these two as commanders, the Taiyi Mountain was no push-over that could be bullied by just anyone.</p>

  <p>Frowning, Gethin turned his head to find many members of the Jin Wu gathering outside the Azure Array. When Gethin saw Micah and Bagot, in particular, confidence came flooding back into him.</p>

  <p>While the two sides were equal in strength, the Vastness Mountain was enough to break the balance.</p>

  <p>"Gethin! Eastern Emperor Taiyi has treated you well, but how could you betray him when the Taiyi Heaven Palace is in trouble?! Do you even have a conscience?" Pearce couldn't hold back his anger the moment he saw Gethin arrive.</p>

  <p>The seven mountains of the Taiyi Heaven Palace had always been related much like siblings, which served as the foundation on which the Taiyi Heaven Palace was founded. If it weren't for Eastern Emperor Taiyi, neither the Vastness Mountain nor Gethin would have had it so easy.</p>

  <p>"A conscience?" Gethin merely sneered. "Eastern Emperor Taiyi is so willful that he has led all creatures of the world onto the wrong path. We, the Vastness Mountain, do nothing but seek the right path!"</p>

  <p>Gethin wanted those words to be heard by Phoenix, Micah, and the rest of the Jin Wu to show his sincerity.</p>

  <p>He had expected Micah, Phoenix, and others to echo his words, but when he turned to them, all he found were cold eyes looking back at him.</p>

  <p>Something was wrong about the atmosphere, he thought.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Gethin couldn't imagine what happened to them.</p>

  <p>Inwardly, Micah and Bagot agreed with Gethin's choice, but they didn't seem to express it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Auden looked at Gethin with a forced smile and said in an aged voice, "This may be the most stupid choice you've ever made in your life."</p>

  <p>"What? Why do you think so?" Aggressively, Natasha asked in return.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at her and smiled faintly. "You'll know soon," he said.</p>

  <p>When her eyes fell on him, the color of her face shifted immediately. "Luo Zheng, you're so lucky you're still alive right now!"</p>

  <p>As early as a few months ago, they had already received an order to capture Luo Zheng, but they never found a good chance to take action.</p>

  <p>Despite the fierce battle between the Jin Wu and the Taiyi Heaven Palace, Luo Zheng had managed to stay safe and sound, much to Natasha's surprise.</p>

  <p>"You seem surprised, Lady Natasha?" Luo Zheng asked plainly.</p>

  <p>With brows raised in response, Natasha said condescendingly, "I am indeed surprised. But it doesn't matter. You're destined to die today."</p>

  <p>In her and Gethin's opinion, the Jin Wu was likely to win along with the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng revealed a bright smile. "I'd like to see who is destined to die today."</p>

  <p>Then, he pointed a finger at the sky. "Go!"</p>

  <p>Gethin, Natasha, Holden, the leaders of the intelligence agency, and the rest of the powerful warriors of the Vastness Mountain found Luo Zheng's behavior all too strange.</p>

  <p>Did he have the right to give orders there?</p>

  <p>Pearce and Auden were present, after all.</p>

  <p>But the next moment made everything clear.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the people from the Azure Mountain Luo Zheng was giving orders to? it was the Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..."</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, many members of the Jin Wu, including Micah, Bagot, and Phoenix, were flying up and surrounding Gethin and his comrades.</p>

  <p>Gethin stared at Micah with eyes wide open in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Natasha's jaw went slack as her body grew extremely stiff.</p>

  <p>"Micah, what's going on?" Gethin asked carefully.</p>

  <p>Giving Gethin an indifferent glance, Micah sighed as he said, "Take action."</p>

  <p>There was nothing light about Luo Zheng's order? the members of the Jin Wu couldn't disobey him.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Micah, Bagot, and the rest intended to fight against them, Gethin roared. The powerful warriors of the Vastness Mountain followed suit and pulled out their Other Shore Tokens.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the sky was filled with auras and flames.</p>

  <p>Taking a look at the sky, Luo Zheng then turned to Pearce. "Elder Pearce, can you give the Jin Wu a hand?"</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu had completely surrendered to Luo Zheng and now served as a valuable combat force.</p>

  <p>While they were definitely strong enough to fight against the Vastness Mountain, casualties probably couldn't be avoided.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Taiyi Mountain and the Azure Mountain, though, things were bound to be much easier.</p>

  <p>Pearce knew just what Luo Zheng was thinking.</p>

  <p>"Everyone," he said immediately. "We should stand out there and eliminate the traitors from the Vastness Mountain. Those members of the Jin Wu have already surrendered to Luo Zheng? don't be afraid of them!"</p>

  <p>And so Pearce took the lead and rushed out.</p>

  <p>Having followed Eastern Emperor Taiyi almost all his life, he absolutely loathed traitors.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Auden, Qiu Yinhe, Goran, and many powerful warriors of the Azure Array also soared into the air.</p>

  <p>It couldn't be ignored how much progress Gethin had made developing his strength over the years.</p>

  <p>As he held a wide, purple sword in his hand, purple dragon energy circled his body. Each time he waved the sword, purple light appeared before everything surrounding him was crushed to dust.</p>

  <p>Even Micah and Bagot, two of the most powerful warriors of the Jin Wu, couldn't get close to Gethin when they worked together. They couldn't dream of taking him down so soon.</p>

  <p>But once Pearce and Auden joined the battle, the position of the Vastness Mountain shifted dramatically.</p>

  <p>While Gethin was indeed powerful, he was still no match for Ying nor Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Pearce and Auden might not have been as strong as Gethin, but the gap between them wasn't too great. When the two attacked Gethin along with Micah and Bagot, not even Gethin could contend with them.</p>

  <p>He was rather high spirited when he arrived, but the tables had turned on him. Gethin was enraged.</p>

  <p>For a moment, he even wondered if he was having a nightmare.</p>

  <p>Just as Gethin was struggling to fight, Natasha's scream resounded from nearby.</p>

  <p>Among the many powerful warriors, Natasha wasn't all that outstanding.</p>

  <p>She couldn't hold on for mere seconds when she was attacked by a number of people simultaneously.</p>

  <p>At the sight of her tragic death, Gethin roared, furious. The purple light was surging then? he was determined to avenge Natasha.</p>

  <p>But as his aura surged, flying swords came rushing at his head one after another.</p>

  <p>They were strong, having emerged from the three evil eyes by Auden's side.</p>

  <p>No one was willing to face them head-on.</p>

  <p>Gethin was ready to dodge them when an Other Shore Token appeared over Bagot's head. It was a triangle with three sides as smooth as mirrors? something very small and exquisite. No one had ever seen such a token before.</p>

  <p>"Freeze!"</p>

  <p>Bagot called out.</p>

  <p>With a flash of light on the token, Gethin was imprisoned in a triangular space, rendered unable to escape.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom..."</p>

  <p>Flying swords containing great power crashed toward his body as he was imprisoned.</p>

  <p>Even with a rare defensive Other Shore Treasure, he still couldn't withstand such a relentless attack.</p>
