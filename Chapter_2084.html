  <p>
</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, Marko saw Luo Luo Zheng appear in this place. He jostled slightly with surprise as he exclaimed, "What?! Aren't you the boy that Pranav was looking for earlier? Where did you go? And how have you managed to reappear?!"</p>

  <p>Moments before, Pranav had used Marko's Soul Searching Flag in order to search for Luo Zheng's figure throughout the whole Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng had disappeared without leaving a trace. This was strange, and everyone had felt quite uneasy about such an occurrence.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was now standing right before Marko's eyes. Marko felt utter shock.</p>

  <p>Still though, despite his curiosity and his questions, he didn't take Luo Luo Zheng very seriously. From Marko's perspective, Luo Luo Zheng was an ordinary Godly Genius who just happened to be slightly stronger than the others. If he wasn't bothered in the slightest by the many Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe, then there was no way a Godly Genius, who was only at the world lord's level, was going to intimidate him. He was nothing in his eyes! In Marko's opinion, Luo Zheng's reappearance here was no different than courting death.</p>

  <p>"Thank God! You've finally shown up on your own. Pranav is stubbornly persistent. He will fight to the end just to find you, and if he doesn't, he'll be talking about this for the next tens of thousands of years to come!"</p>

  <p>Marko whined.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did nothing but stare coldly back at Marko. After Marko finished speaking, Luo Luo Zheng ordered, "Kill him. Use the most painful method possible." His tone was completely flat and without any emotion whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Marko's face suddenly became astonished, "Who are you talking to?</p>

  <p>Wait! Have you managed to get yourself a helping hand?"</p>

  <p>As the True Gods of the divine land, no one ever considered a secondary creature as anything, let alone worthy of something. The True Gods' identities as Murphy's disciples made them even prouder and more arrogant. Although he couldn't take his question back, the fact remained that Marko had never thought Luo Luo Zheng would really find a powerful helper.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Luo Zheng could answer his question, a calm voice suddenly came from behind Marko. "Congratulations! You got that right!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Abruptly, an overwhelming fighting intent began to rise.</p>

  <p>This man's fighting intent contained an invincible might. It was as if he feared absolutely nothing in the world. Even if his life was directly on the line, he wouldn't hesitate in charging forward? not even for a second.</p>

  <p>Upon feeling the overwhelming fighting intent, Marko immediately knew that he had encountered great trouble.</p>

  <p>Although his frivolous and playful personality often took precedence, Marko's talent was undoubtedly excellent. This was true because otherwise, he would never have been taken in by Murphy as his disciple.</p>

  <p>As soon as he felt the fighting intent, his right hand started to shake, and the Flash Bat that was perched on the Soul Searching Flag instantly turned into a grey light as it charged toward the person behind him.</p>

  <p>The Flash Bat's speed was so tremendous that it could barely be seen by the naked eye.</p>

  <p>Some moments earlier, even Supreme Lord of Thunder Punishment and the others had been completely unable to catch a genuine glimpse of it.</p>

  <p>All they could see was a grey flash.</p>

  <p>The person who had appeared behind Marko reached out his hand in an instant and opened it fiercely. As though he were catching a baseball, the grey flash stopped in his hand. Although the Flash Bat continued struggling violently, it was unable to break free from his grasp.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's a Flash Bat! Such a rare creature. What a pity to have to kill it."</p>

  <p>The man revealed a sly smile and then squeezed his hand forcefully, causing the Flash Bat's soul to instantly dissipate.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the Flash Bat wasn't very powerful, and its soul was usually considered as extremely fragile. Due to its very high speeds though, even ordinary True Gods would have their fair share of difficulties tracking it, let alone killing it.</p>

  <p>For Blayd, this was far from challenging.</p>

  <p>"You! How dare you kill my Flash Bat?!"</p>

  <p>Marko's eyes widened with astonishment and anger. He might not have caught the Flash Bat by himself, but he had always regarded it as a precious treasure. He falsely believed that no one in this universe would have the capacity to catch it, and he had thus sent it out confidently.</p>

  <p>It had never crossed his mind that he'd have to face this man, who had suddenly appeared, and had a strength that far exceeded his imagination.</p>

  <p>"Such a strong fighting intent... Are you a member of the War God Hall?" Marko gritted his teeth as he asked his question.</p>

  <p>Blayd shrugged his shoulders, "I won't deny it." As he spoke, his fighting intent grew even stronger. Once he entered the battlefield, he became extremely excited. His senses heightened and he felt ready to attack at any moment.</p>

  <p>Marko kept his guard up and said "I am Murphy's disciple," in a cold, unwelcoming voice.</p>

  <p>"I know," Blayd replied flatly.</p>

  <p>"This is a universal war between two Holy Beings. My master is watching us right now!" Marko exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I know," Blayd replied anew.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the price to pay for meddling in this matter?" Marko asked again.</p>

  <p>"I know!" Blayd shouted ferociously this time.</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you get the hell out of here?" Marko shouted.</p>

  <p>Blayd revealed a faint smile and as he stared directly into Marko's eyes, his eyes filled with pity. "I know the significance of all this, yet I'm still determined to intervene in this matter." Once he finished speaking, he took a step into the air.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A dull sound exploded from beneath Blayd's feet.</p>

  <p>Here, in this universe, the space was far less condensed than that of the divine land. With a single step from this powerful man, the space instantly collapsed under the great pressure. So much so that it even formed an annihilating force that equally exploded in the air, spreading to the vast space beneath Blayd's feet.</p>

  <p>This was just the power of a single step!</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng watched the powerful destructive force erupt forth, he could do nothing but sigh in absolute awe. From his perspective, Blayd seemed just too powerful!</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng had one third of a Holy Being's strength source at hand, he still hadn't been able to fully utilize it. This was because his cultivation level was still too low, and his control over his strength wasn't so great just yet.</p>

  <p>This though, wasn't necessarily Luo Zheng's fault. It was like giving a knife to a three or four-year-old child. No matter how smart the child was, it would still be difficult for them to fully display the knife's power.</p>

  <p>Thus, even though Luo Luo Zheng possessed physical strength that far exceeded that of Blayd, he was still no match to him. That was, if he were to fight Blayd with merely his physical strength alone.</p>

  <p>Marko was already on full guard against Blayd's movements. Upon hearing Blayd's reply, his face darkened and he threatened, "My master could crush you into muddy flesh in the blink of an eye! Don't you fear death?"</p>

  <p>"Humph!" was all that could be heard in reply.</p>

  <p>A cold smile appeared on Blayd's face. In the air above, he continued rushing forward at an extremely fast speed. Every step he took caused a vast space to collapse beneath him and released an intense destructive force.</p>

  <p>As Marko watched him approach, frozen in stance, his eyes narrowed in nervousness.</p>

  <p>Should he choose to fight or to flee?</p>

  <p>Even if he chose to escape, Blayd would catch him in an instant. At that moment, Marko realized he could no longer hesitate and he shook the Soul Searching Flag in his hand. Several True God Souls flew out from the Soul Searching Flag, one by one.</p>

  <p>There were only seven True God Souls within the Soul Searching Flag, and each of them had been refined using a secret soul technique over countless years. They were the Soul Searching Flag's trump cards, so to speak.</p>

  <p>Prior to right now, Marko never imagined that he would have to make use of the True God Souls. In fact, he had only used the Flash Bat in an attempt to warn the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe. Seeing the results of his eye-opener though, he was worried about whether or not these seven True God Souls were enough to protect him.</p>

  <p>The seven True God Souls each had their own unique characteristics.</p>

  <p>They were respectively an armored general, an elder with long whiskers, a woman, a true spirit... There were others, too. Needless to say, they had all been very powerful creatures when they were still alive.</p>

  <p>Most powerful warriors were unwilling to see their souls enslaved and driven by others. Prior to such an enslavement, many would think of and attempt ways to destroy their own souls. In other words, capturing a True God's soul wasn't set out to be an easy task. Once someone succeeded in doing so though, it was a formidable and rare skill.</p>

  <p>Although Master Evil and Wayne were much stronger than Blayd, dealing with these powerful souls might actually prove to be a challenge for them while it was much easier for Blayd. The main reason for the latter was because Blayd was from the War God Hall.</p>

  <p>The warriors of the War God Hall specialized in the Fighting Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Once their fighting intent was activated, it became completely unstoppable. Even their souls would be surrounded by the raging fighting intent and thus, they wouldn't even fear soul-level attacks.</p>

  <p>When the first True God Soul rushed over to him, Blayd immediately punched it head-on. His fist was filled with fighting intent as it smashed into the void. The space, tens of thousands of feet wide immediately exploded, and everything within it began to dissipate.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Once the glaring light that was produced by the annihilation disappeared, the first True God's soul was gone, nowhere to be seen. It had already been destroyed and had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Blayd didn't stop there, though. His second punch was loaded and he launched it without a moment's hesitation.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Every time a dull sound reverberated, a vast expanse of space was ultimately demolished, leaving nothing more but dust behind.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a True God Soul was also destroyed.</p>

  <p>It was then that Marko's heart sank in despair. Each of these True God Souls were legitimate enough to serve as his trump card, but they couldn't even withstand a single blow from this man. He wondered how Luo Luo Zheng had managed to find such a powerful helping hand.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord of Oracle and Xun, who were bound to the Soul Searching Flag, watched the scene play out before them, their eyes widened in astonishment. They stared at the man who looked like a war god, and both their expressions were filled with disbelief.</p>

  <p>And at the same time, they shared the same thoughts that Marko was having. Where had Luo Luo Zheng found such a powerful warrior who was actually willing to help him?!</p>
