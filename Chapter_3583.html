<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In some province, the big Black Ship cut across the sky quick as a flash.</p>

  <p>Following behind the Black Ship were two huge golden Buddha statues being carried atop the shoulders of a ten-thousand-foot-tall bald giant.</p>

  <p>The bald giant's eyes shone green and an immense string of Buddha beads hung around his neck and rested on his chest. His upper body was bare and his muscles bulged like massive hills.</p>

  <p>"Now that I am here, don't even try to escape! Hand them over! It's time we settle the score!" roared the bald giant.</p>

  <p>The words thundered from his mouth, sending out strong and powerful reverberating sound waves through the air.</p>

  <p>There just so happened to be a medium-sized country below the bald giant, with several types of creatures living there. Most of them were mortals with a lifespan of less than a hundred years.</p>

  <p>To them, the rumbles from the sky were like the end of the world.</p>

  <p>Many of them didn't even have the chance to react before they were hit by the sound, turned into a cloud of blood mist and disappeared into thin air.</p>

  <p>The tall buildings, walls and streets were all blasted into powder, reducing the city to a dusty desert.</p>

  <p>There were many mortals in the Source World who lived like ants. Dying in an instant as powerful warriors fought was quite common for creatures like them.</p>

  <p>The bald giant had been referring to the Descending Rings the Black Ship had taken from the Thunder Dimorphodon when he spoke.</p>

  <p>Since they had snatched the Descending Rings, the Divine Farmer race and the Bearing race had been working together and attempted to lay siege to them many times in the Source World.</p>

  <p>But time and time again the Black Ship had disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>They had still not managed to destroy the Black Ship or even get hold of a single member of the crew thus far.</p>

  <p>At the end of the Black Ship hung a dinghy with two gold locks. When the Black Ship flew at high speed, the dinghy moved like a swing floating in the air.</p>

  <p>Sitting on the swinging dinghy was Shera.</p>

  <p>Hearing the giant's roar, she replied with a smile on her face, "I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about."</p>

  <p>Her voice was not as loud as the giant's but traveled far away. The creatures throughout half the province could hear it all the same.</p>

  <p>They looked around from below, in search of the source of the voice but to no avail.</p>

  <p>"You're asking for it now!"</p>

  <p>The malicious aura on the bald giant's face flashed, and his shoulders suddenly trembled. The two Buddha statues on his shoulders rose up.</p>

  <p>"Take this!"</p>

  <p>The bald giant waved his hands towards the Black Ship, and the two Buddha statues mirrored him.</p>

  <p>Tens of millions of huge palm prints swept across the sky in an instant.</p>

  <p>At first, they were scattered chaotically but soon began overlapping, turning into a mighty and solid palm print.</p>

  <p>The palm print quickly covered the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>This sight excited Shera to her core. It seemed as though she had something she wanted to verify here.</p>

  <p>Creak! Creak! Creak!</p>

  <p>The Black Ship began creaking under the terrifying pressure of the palm print. It sounded as if it would snap and disintegrate any moment now.</p>

  <p>But as the palm print approached the Black Ship, a circle of silver light suddenly appeared on the Black Ship's surface. The palm print touched the light and left a palm print on it.</p>

  <p>With a smile on her face, Shera flicked her fingers at the bald giant, softly uttering, "Bang!"</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The bald giant's broad chest suddenly sank, a huge palm print appearing on it.</p>

  <p>His own terrifying attack had just been deflected back at him.</p>

  <p>Caught off guard, the bald giant was slapped down from the sky and fell hard.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>His huge body smashed into the ground, forming a crater millions of feet deep. The hundreds of gigantic mountains around him collapsed one by one. Countless creatures were injured and died.</p>

  <p>The bald giant's bronze body was incredibly tough. Even a strike of this magnitude only managed to stop his breathing for a few seconds. He smashed his enormous fist on the ground, and bounced into the air once more.</p>

  <p>But when he looked into the distance, to his surprise, there was nothing there. The Black Ship had escaped.</p>

  <p>Shera got up from the dinghy and made her way towards the cabin.</p>

  <p>There, she found the "bamboo pole" complaining, "Since we acquired the Descending Rings, we've been hunted constantly, being chased every other day."</p>

  <p>The new Other Shore Token the Black Ship had obtained, a silver sphere, floated above the head of the "bamboo pole".</p>

  <p>This was the first time it had been put to use and its effects were more than satisfactory.</p>

  <p>"This sort of life is not new to us," Shera said, trying to comfort the "bamboo pole".</p>

  <p>"But the Descending Rings are useless! The three warriors that descended have all died. They are flawed," the "bamboo pole" whined discontentedly.</p>

  <p>"The problem lies in the golden red Chaotic Source Spirits, but Luo Zheng has taken them," Shera sighed.</p>

  <p>The Black Ship had done a thorough investigation into Luo Zheng's identity and Shera suggested the captain head to the Taiyi Heaven Palace and capture him.</p>

  <p>However, not only was it incredibly difficult to remove Luo Zheng in the base of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, it seemed there was something else the captain was afraid of. So for now, they could do nothing but wait.</p>

  <p>But while they waited, they were chased the entire time and this was what upset the "bamboo pole".</p>

  <p>Just as Shera comforted the "bamboo pole", an unremarkable contact rune beside lit up.</p>

  <p>She looked at the contact rune and a strange expression contorted her face.</p>

  <p>"The contact array of the Black Mountain Guild has been activated. Is someone planning an attack on them?"</p>

  <p>"Leave them alone," the "bamboo pole" huffed.</p>

  <p>The Black Mountain Guild was not under the direct control of the Black Ship. There was no obligation for them to protect the Black Mountain Guild.</p>

  <p>Shera blinked and the figure of the Evil God appeared in her mind.</p>

  <p>An odd feeling swirled in her gut and this prompted her to return to her room. Once there, she took out a small bottle, the blurry figure of the Evil God still outlined in it.</p>

  <p>Since the Evil God had been put into Luo Zheng's inner world, this figure hadn't moved. All it proved was that he was still alive but his current state was unknowable.</p>

  <p>Although Shera had already given up, she would still pull out this bottle and have a look at it from time to time.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>Shock and uneasiness filled Shera's eyes. The blurry figure of the Evil God sat cross-legged in the bottle, as if he was cultivating.</p>

  <p>'Has he regained his freedom?</p>

  <p>That's impossible.'</p>

  <p>Shera threw this thought out immediately. If the Evil God had achieved freedom, he would have already tried to contact her.</p>

  <p>Had he obtained freedom but was under Luo Zheng's control?</p>

  <p>That was probably the case.</p>

  <p>Shera had judged the situation accurately in a snap.</p>
