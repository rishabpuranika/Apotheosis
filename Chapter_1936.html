<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1936 The Boundary Cloud (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>It was quiet.</p>

  <p>After entering the Valley of Time, the foreign martial artists had chosen to go into seclusion as soon as they could. They wanted to consolidate the things they had obtained in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>As for the Dragon Flyer race of the Valley of Time, they were a race that, simply put, loved peace and quiet.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Flyer warriors had half-dragon and half-human bodies. Most of the time, they were much like statues. They stood in the same posture for several days without saying a single word. Only when movements in the Valley of Time were observed would they pay attention to them.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>Today though, the vitality between heaven and earth in the sky above the Valley of Time began to tremble violently. The energy mixed together and burst out with an explosive sound.</p>

  <p>The originally colorless and formless vitality between heaven and earth quickly formed into a pale yellow ring, continuously expanding outward to its surroundings. On the surface of the glowing ring, several rhombus-shaped patterns appeared.</p>

  <p>"This is the Boundary Cloud. Someone has entered the realm of a world lord," a member of the Dragon Flyer race said calmly, raising his eyes in order to look at the Boundary Cloud.</p>

  <p>Inside the inner world of a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm, the Spirit Supreme Realm, or the Spirit Transformation Realm, the boundaries were extremely vague and blurred. In other words, no clear limitations were put in place. Once the warrior became a world lord though, a boundary-forming power would appear within their inner world. Only at that point in time would clear boundaries appear in their inner world, allowing the latter to become a great world.</p>

  <p>In the process of forming such boundaries, the Boundary Cloud would be produced when a martial artist resonated with the vitality between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>In the Valley of Time, there were many occurrences where the Boundary Cloud could, and would, be born. Many martial artists entering the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land would only leave after reaching the realm of a world lord, and the vast majority of them would only choose the Valley of Time in order to attempt breaking through to this realm.</p>

  <p>"This warrior's Boundary Cloud can spread out for twenty miles and it seems that the warrior is a secondary creature," said an elder from the Dragon Flyer race as he stared at the Boundary Cloud.</p>

  <p>Often, the warriors of the Dragon Flyer race were capable of seeing the Boundary Cloud. Through the extent of the Boundary Cloud, they could equally comprehend a martial artist's foundation and potential.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, when a martial artist stepped into the realm of a world lord, the condensed Boundary Cloud would spread out for three to five miles. In the Valley of Time, this sort of Boundary Cloud was common. Furthermore, it was known that most martial artists could only do it to this degree.</p>

  <p>When an outstanding martial artist became a world lord though, things were slightly different. They would resonate with the vitality between heaven and earth, producing a Boundary Cloud that could easily spread out to a length of 7 or 8 miles.</p>

  <p>An even smaller number of mighty martial artists could spread their Boundary Cloud out to a range of approximately 15 miles!</p>

  <p>And again, a few geniuses from the divine land could actually spread their Boundary Cloud to 20 miles or further upon breakthrough.</p>

  <p>These martial artists were known to be extremely rare.</p>

  <p>Even in the Valley of Time, a single warrior like this could appear only once in many, many years.</p>

  <p>Overall, martial artists that could spread the Boundary Cloud all the way to longer than fifteen miles would have a 50% chance of condensing a Godly Tile in the future. There were many ways to obtain a Godly Tile, through inheritance or by snatching one from someone else for example.</p>

  <p>But when it was created by the warrior himself, it was obviously the most suitable and precious.</p>

  <p>If the Boundary Cloud spread out 20 miles, then this said martial artist would have an 80% chance of condensing a Godly Tile. 50% was considered a good probability, but this was seen as really quite high.</p>

  <p>Right now though, the main factor in play was that the Boundary Cloud in fact came from a secondary creature. That was truly shocking!</p>

  <p>"I've said it before and I'll say it again. These secondary creatures are very special. There should be a Holy Being behind them," said another elder of the race.</p>

  <p>The "secondary creatures" that the elder spoke of were Luo Zheng and his group of Godly Geniuses, of course.</p>

  <p>These warriors had a couple traits in common. They were all secondary creatures for one, and they were all personally arranged by the Dragon Flyer race's prophet. The prophet let them cultivate in seclusion inside the best of caves. This kind of treatment was something that the Dragon Flyer race had never seen before. For this reason, they knew their origins must be extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Of course, they didn't know that these Godly Geniuses had originally been arranged by the master of the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The Boundary Cloud in the sky didn't dissipate before a long time, continuing to circle in the air above instead. At the top of Valley of Time, a handsome youth had just stepped out of a deep cave. This person was none other than Nathan himself.</p>

  <p>He looked at the slowly expanding Boundary Cloud in the sky and a satisfied smile appeared on his face. "Father was right. When one breaks through to become a world lord, the Boundary Cloud created from the boundary-forming power can truly reach a distance of twenty miles. No one can do better in the entire universe!"</p>

  <p>Any martial artist that successfully entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was considered extremely outstanding. Even here in the Valley of Time, a twenty-mile-long Boundary Cloud only very rarely appeared. In this grand era of the Evolutionary Universe, the greatest Boundary Cloud had only been a total of 14 miles long. Needless to say, Nathan had far exceeded this past result.</p>

  <p>"Looks like I'm the first to make a breakthrough and become a world lord! I wonder how long it took Luo Zheng to enter the Spirit Transformation Realm," he murmured. He had only left the cave once, when he'd stepped into the Spirit Transformation Realm. Therefore, he naturally wasn't clear on how everyone was undergoing closed-door seclusion.</p>
