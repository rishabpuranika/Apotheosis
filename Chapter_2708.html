  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked along the edge of the crater for a while, but he didn't find anything special.</p>

  <p>He then narrowed his eyes and, with his spiritual sense, searched the surrounding area within dozens of miles.</p>

  <p>Except for the fact that when part of his spiritual sense expanded into the forbidden land, it hit an invisible wall and bounced back, he found nothing unusual.</p>

  <p>After searching for a while more, he took out the Stone Mouse's corpse from his space ring.</p>

  <p>Once the corpse was activated, the image appeared in his mind again.</p>

  <p>As he mentally moved to the center of the image, he physically walked over to the same exact place that was in the center of the image.</p>

  <p>"It's the same place," Luo Zheng said, feeling confused. Normally, when a rare creature like the Stone Mouse was born, it would make quite a scene.</p>

  <p>Traces of its birth would linger behind even if it wasn't physically present yet.</p>

  <p>So why couldn't he see the slightest difference in this place? It looked like absolutely nothing out of the ordinary had happened here.</p>

  <p>Had he come too late? Had the body of the reborn Stone Mouse already been taken away?</p>

  <p>Just as he was wondering about this, a dozen beams of light crossed his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>"There are people coming."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately retracted his spiritual sense and looked down.</p>

  <p>Right below him, there was a crack that spread from the edge of the crater. He took a step forward and entered the crack.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Cultivation Nature! Hide!"</p>

  <p>As he uttered these words, his breath and aura disappeared, and his physical form completely melted into his surroundings.</p>

  <p>In the perception of others, he would look no different from a stone.</p>

  <p>Not long after he had hidden in plain sight, more than a dozen people flew up to this area. One of the strong men sniffed the air and said, "The smell from the Abyss Demon Region is disgusting!"</p>

  <p>"It's just the smell of sulfur. It's not a big deal. Did you notice a streak of spiritual sense just now?" another man said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I didn't feel it, either."</p>

  <p>"Can there be anyone else in this damn place? Leland, you are too sensitive!"</p>

  <p>The rest of them didn't know what Leland was talking about.</p>

  <p>"I sensed it, but it only lasted for a moment before disappearing... Was I just imagining it?" Leland murmured, more to himself than anyone else.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng, who was hiding in the crack, could clearly hear the whole conversation and was a little taken aback.</p>

  <p>This Leland guy seemed to have really keen senses. Luo Zheng wondered what his cultivation base could be.</p>

  <p>If these people were just top-rank True Gods, Luo Zheng would have nothing to worry about.</p>

  <p>In fact, he was not even afraid of consummate True Gods unless they were from the powerful clans on the Floating Islands, because only they had Holy Beings to back them up.</p>

  <p>However, the probability of him running into such a situation was very low.</p>

  <p>"Well, let's not think too much about it. We should stick to our own business. Cameron Lu, where is the place you mentioned?" Leland continued in a low voice.</p>

  <p>With a muffled voice, Cameron replied, "We're standing there! I set up a magic array to hide that cave."</p>

  <p>A few dozen days ago, he had gone to the Evil Ghost Region to capture ghost rhinoceroses.</p>

  <p>As their horns were an indispensable material for the refinement of many top-grade pills, they were extremely valuable and as such very popular among all the powerful clans and first and second-tier families.</p>

  <p>In the current climate, the horns of a ghost rhinoceros could be sold for about twenty divine might coins.</p>

  <p>It was not easy for a True God to earn divine might coins outside of venturing the forbidden lands. Killing ghost rhinoceroses and getting their horns was one of the best ways to earn coins.</p>

  <p>But as the number of True Gods hunting ghost rhinoceroses had increased, there were fewer and fewer ghost rhinoceroses in the Evil Ghost Region.</p>

  <p>Last time, Cameron had not encountered any ghost rhinoceros at all, so he had ventured deeper and deeper into the Evil Ghost Region. But instead of finding a ghost rhinoceros, he had stumbled upon a strange phenomenon at the edge of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>After flying to this place, he had found a cave that had collapsed here.</p>

  <p>He hadn't been able to figure out what was under the cave, but judging from that weird phenomenon, he was sure that something had turned up.</p>

  <p>It could be a rare treasure or a rare beast.</p>

  <p>As a top-rank True God with low strength, Cameron hadn't dared to explore the cave alone.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he had set up a magic array to hide the cave instead.</p>

  <p>Although he did not have outstanding combat abilities, he was extremely proficient in setting up arrays. His array had even managed to deceive Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"It's just a magic array?"</p>

  <p>Hearing what Cameron said, Luo Zheng pursed his lips. He couldn't believe that he had been careless enough to be fooled by a magic array.</p>

  <p>At this point, he could not help but carefully poke his head out from a corner of the crack. As his eyes swept over those True Gods, he raised his eyebrows in surprise.</p>

  <p>"One Demi-holy Being and two consummate True Gods!" Shock appeared in Luo Zheng's eyes.</p>

  <p>In the divine land, there were very few Demi-holy Beings. Only a few of the first-tier clans had them.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Luo Zheng had never imagined that he would meet a Demi-holy Being today.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was sizing them up, the purple-robed Demi-holy Being turned his head in Luo Zheng's direction as if he had sensed something.</p>

  <p>His eyes, as sharp as swords, swept over the crack not far away.</p>

  <p>But the crack was obviously empty.</p>

  <p>Feeling that something was odd, the Demi-holy Being released his spiritual sense but found nothing.</p>

  <p>"Leland, what's wrong with you today? Why are you so suspicious?" a middle-aged man in white asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>The Demi-holy Being was Leland, the lord of a region.</p>

  <p>Some of the first-tier clans were too weak to have a Floating Island in the Time Sea, so they could only expand their own territory and ultimately occupy the entire region.</p>

  <p>But the powerful clans on the Floating Islands were dismissive of such clans.</p>

  <p>For example, after the Han Clan had become a powerful clan with their own Floating Island, they hadn't intervened in the development of the regions under their rule. They did not completely control the regions, but gave a lot of resources to the families attached to them.</p>

  <p>Knowing that it was impossible for him to become a Holy Being or make his clan a powerful one, Leland claimed to be the lord of the region he lived in.</p>

  <p>"I keep feeling like someone is spying on us, but it seems that I'm just imagining things," Leland said. He did not expect that a consummate True God could be hiding right under his nose.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Cameron walked three circles around an open space, and then he heavily struck the ground with his palms.</p>

  <p>A dark magenta line quickly spread along the path Cameron had walked, forming a big circle on the ground. Until now, everything inside this circle had been condensed by the magic array. Now that Cameron had withdrawn the magic array, a large cave appeared.</p>

  <p>Leland stared at the entrance of the cave for a moment, and then he entered it.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, the two consummate True Gods and over ten top-rank True Gods followed him into the cave.</p>

  <p>After a while, Luo Zheng slowly climbed out of the crack and frowned. "The cave must have been built for the Stone Mouse. Unexpectedly, they have found it ahead of me. What's more troublesome is that one of them is a Demi-holy Being!"</p>

  <p>After waiting at the entrance of the cave for a while, Luo Zheng quietly slipped inside.</p>

  <p>    </p>
