<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The octopuses had no natural enemies on Stage Thirteen.</p>

  <p>In fact, their only shortcoming was that they couldn't leave the triangular caves where they hid, limiting their range of motion.</p>

  <p>'What kind of creature chased after them, making them flee like mad?' the pig-faced monsters wondered.</p>

  <p>Clatter? clatter? clatter?</p>

  <p>The octopuses were followed closely by Luo Zheng as he rolled down the mountain, still locked in the bronze plates.</p>

  <p>The plates bumping along the way made a deafening sound.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Finally, Luo Zheng smashed into the valley. More than half his body was embedded underground.</p>

  <p>The two pig-faced monsters nearest Luo Zheng paled in shock. If they were caught in Luo Zheng's fall, they'd have definitely been crushed.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Look! What's that?"</p>

  <p>"That seems to be a Green Jade Beast?"</p>

  <p>Having lived around the black pool for years, the pig-faced monsters knew a little about it.</p>

  <p>Creatures in the pool were considered very special? the Green Jade Bugs being just one kind of them, and at the lowest level.</p>

  <p>The bodies of these bugs were nothing like that of common bugs with flesh and blood. They seemed to be carved out of jade, making their bodies extremely tough.</p>

  <p>Many strange life forms populated the black pool.</p>

  <p>It was said that some pig-faced monsters had even seen giant beasts emerge from the water. The Green Jade Beasts were cyan all over, and like the Green Jade Bugs, their bodies seemed carved from jade. But in all the time the pig-faced monsters had been there, the beasts had only appeared once or twice. Many no longer believed in their existence.</p>

  <p>No concrete evidence was available to prove whether or not the Green Jade Beasts really existed in the black pool.</p>

  <p>Still, no one explored the black pool and lived. The pig-faced monsters had no idea how deep the water was, nor what creatures lurked down there.</p>

  <p>But this time, they encountered the strange Luo Zheng. He was probably the only 'bait' who could be re-used after being bitten by the Green Jade Bugs.</p>

  <p>What was most surprising, though, was how he had managed to attract the giant Green Jade Beast from the black pool!</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>With its great wings and four strong legs, climbing down the mountain was an easy task for the beast.</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng hit the ground, the Green Jade Beast also jumped into the valley.</p>

  <p>The great beast looked as though it was carved right out of jade. The pig-faced monsters felt its powerful aura and trembled in fear.</p>

  <p>But the Green Jade Beast wasn't interested in the weak pig-faced monsters of the valley. It gave them a quick glance before jumping into one of the triangular caves.</p>

  <p>The octopus hiding in the triangular cave naturally tried to resist, but the strength of the Green Jade Beast was all too great. Even with dozens of tentacles wrapped around its body, it ruined them all with a mere shake of its body.</p>

  <p>Both the octopus' tentacles and its head were considered delicacies to the beast. It took a great bite out of the creature, and in mere seconds, the octopus was gobbled up.</p>

  <p>When the beast stepped out of the cave, it didn't seem satisfied? it went straight into another cave to feast.</p>

  <p>Noises of struggle came from the cave before another octopus was eaten up.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?"</p>

  <p>"How ferocious!"</p>

  <p>"If they're all eaten up? how are we going to survive?"</p>

  <p>The pig-faced monsters looked upset as the onset of doom came over them.</p>

  <p>They could establish themselves on Stage Thirteen because they relied on the octopuses. But now that they were eaten up by the beast one by one, the pig-faced monsters could foresee that their life in the Dark Region would be harder.</p>

  <p>"We still have Master Teague!"</p>

  <p>"Master Teague has already become a purified being!"</p>

  <p>"Master Teague! Where are you? Why haven't you appeared? This Green Jade Beast is no match for you!"</p>

  <p>Just now, the light column circled the valley before stopping. Nobody knew what was going on under the tomb.</p>

  <p>Once the octopuses were in the Green Jade Beast's stomach, the beast headed to the valley to slaughter pig-faced monsters.</p>

  <p>Its prey scattered, shrieking and howling in misery.</p>

  <p>After a round of slaughter, its eyes fell right on Luo Zheng? this human bait was what had attracted it from the depths of the black pool.</p>

  <p>A wry smile made its way to Luo Zheng's face as he felt the gaze of the Green Jade Beast.</p>

  <p>The Green Jade Bugs couldn't dream of killing Luo Zheng, but this beast easily tore the octopuses apart? Luo Zheng's body was probably more like paper in its hands.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng was basically a fish on a chopping block. He could barely resist, let alone run away. All he could do was lie on the ground and watch the beast approach him, step by step.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, under the tomb?</p>

  <p>The human girl wandered in circles before returning to the center of the dark cave, sitting atop bloody piles of meat.</p>

  <p>The narrow space was somehow confusing? the world wasn't supposed to be so narrow, cramped, and dark.</p>

  <p>What was wrong?</p>

  <p>Just then, she heard the shouts from outside.</p>

  <p>"Master Teague?"</p>

  <p>The name sounded familiar?were they calling her?</p>

  <p>But as she tried to recall in her subconscious, a hateful pig-face appeared in her mind. She couldn't help but frown at the thought of it and tried to direct her mind elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Although the shouts were rather annoying, they reminded her that there was a wide world outside the tomb, waiting for her.</p>

  <p>"I want to step outside?"</p>

  <p>With this thought, she began tapping her foot.</p>

  <p>By merely releasing force from her small foot, her body shot up like an arrow. The explosive strength of her physical body was beyond impressive.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The fresh soil that covered the tomb burst from the girl's strength as she rushed out.</p>

  <p>The moment she came into contact with the light, it changed significantly.</p>

  <p>Originally, the beam of light was in the shape of a circular column, but the moment it touched the young girl's body, the light concentrated right on her, illuminating her entire figure. Only a bright silhouette remained.</p>

  <p>"The light... it makes me comfortable?"</p>

  <p>Bathed in light, the girl looked rather relaxed.</p>

  <p>She could still feel the countless little spirits contained within the light, subject to her orders.</p>

  <p>In a single thought, rays of light were woven into a shiny dress, that fit her perfectly.</p>

  <p>Everyone else in the valley was wide-eyed and dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>After being madly slaughtered by the Green Jade Beast, the pig-faced monsters were left in desperate fear. When the tomb exploded, they fled in all directions. Now they felt saved, thinking that Master Teague finally appeared.</p>

  <p>But what rushed out from under the tomb was a mere human girl.</p>

  <p>Even Luo Zheng was just as shocked.</p>

  <p>Only a few steps away from him was the Green Jade Beast, and one of its cyan claws was already pressing onto his head? he was sure he was doomed. But when the human girl came into his view, his surprise almost made him forget the dire situation he was in.</p>
