<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Malcom and Rehaan were in a tight fix. The condition at hand was now beyond their command. They weren't imbeciles to fail to discover this for themselves.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Malcom shouted in incredulity. His face portrayed coldness.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng glanced at him and asked, "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"We are stuck. This is the furthest we can move," Malcom replied.</p>

  <p>The obstacle had out-powered them. Cultivating forceful energy was the fundamental reason they had this substantial burden on their shoulder.</p>

  <p>However, they were not the particular ones encountering this dilemma.</p>

  <p>Fabian and Esther could reaffirm their life vitality with life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>They cultivated their life vitality instead of their bodies. But now, both the life vitality consumption and their life vitality crystal consumption were accelerating at a lightning speed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Luo Luo Zheng, if we continue marching ahead, we will have slim chances of combating the Dark Nether Death Light!" Fabian said in a distressed tone.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Xun sneered, "Didn't you already know? You will be dragged closer to the red dot in this fog whether you move or not."</p>

  <p>The closer they drew to the red dot, the mightier the Dark Nether Death Light became. The logic of this caused their hearts to sink with dread. How would they withdraw themselves and be spared from this condition?</p>

  <p>Getting close to the core was a tremendous blunder because they wouldn't have the restraint from the fog. Withstanding the Dark Nether Death Light would be an arduous ordeal.</p>

  <p>At the same moment, everyone peered at Yolande.</p>

  <p>"Put your life vitality into that stuff surrounding your neck," she said to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yolande had attached this crab-shaped substance around Luo Zheng's neck in no time. As she did that, everyone present had been curious. Now that she mentioned the item, they all gazed at it.</p>

  <p>"What is that for?"</p>

  <p>"It looks like a precious gem."</p>

  <p>"Can it protect us?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng did what he was told without a question. Yolande's voice expressed affirmation of being competent to guide everyone out of this fog. If that was the case, resisting Dark Nether Death Light wouldn't be a hard nut to crack.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng lifted his hand and infused an upsurge of life vitality into the crab in front of his chest.</p>

  <p>Zing, zing, zing...</p>

  <p>An orange glimmer of light radiated from the crab. It covered a section of two hundred feet, spreading quickly in all directions.</p>

  <p>Everyone was submerged when the light was emitted. Dark Nether Death Light had dwindled, and its pressure had slackened. Malcom and the others felt the hasty development.</p>

  <p>"It's amazing. It can block Dark Nether Death Light!"</p>

  <p>"It seems that Yolande really has a plan!"</p>

  <p>"But why would she give that item to Luo Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Yolande's method worked, giving the crowd a lot of confidence. She really did have a way to deal with the trouble in the core region, so it was a lot more likely she would be able to lead everyone out.</p>

  <p>Malcom flashed his eyesight as he approached Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What are you seeking to do?" Esther, Fabian, and Jarrod in unison stood in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Peace between the two sides was short-lived. This meant that each side was on toes awaiting for something to crop up.</p>

  <p>"I'm just trying to get closer to Luo Luo Zheng," Malcom said frowning.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Xun scoffed. She was able to see through Malcom's intentions with a single glance.</p>

  <p>The two sides weren't allies as they drew towards the red dot. The intensity of Dark Nether Death Light became enormous. Malcom, Rehaan and the three Night Group members would be instantly eradicated by Dark Nether Death Light if Luo Luo Zheng decided to ditch them.</p>

  <p>Malcom would not let himself be put into such a difficult situation.</p>

  <p>If walking in the fog became impossible, he would drag Luo Luo Zheng and die with him. If he would get through the fog, then he would challenge Luo Luo Zheng in a battle. Life or death. Their martial arts skills would be the determiner.</p>

  <p>"No reason. If this decision bothers you, then I will make my move now."</p>

  <p>The black Mu Ning on Malcom's body shimmered, and the pair of black wings on his back flapped once again.</p>

  <p>After maintaining the peace for only a few hours, they once again began to clash each other.</p>

  <p>"Carrying out a move here isn't an ideal idea," Luo Luo Zheng told Malcom as he chuckled sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"I know," Malcom nodded. "But I'm afraid before long I won't even have the right to fight anymore! Unless you agree to my conditions!"</p>

  <p>"What Malcom said is right. If Luo Luo Zheng withdraws this light barrier as we approach Dark Nether Death Light, we will all die," Shane echoed. The other two top-level war lords of Night Group and Rehaan nodded their heads in agreement.</p>

  <p>"Then what solution do you have in mind?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"It's very simple. Just stick with us!" Malcom burst out in hilarity as he stared at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They would be safer when they held Luo Luo Zheng as a hostage.</p>

  <p>"And if I don't agree?" Luo Luo Zheng repeated his query.</p>

  <p>"That would be troublesome. This suggests that we take an audacious move instantly!" Malcom said as he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, stay by my side." Yolande said calmly after walking up to Luo Luo Zheng. She then pointed at Esther and Fabian as she declared to them, "As for you two, stay with them!"</p>

  <p>'Luo Luo Zheng and Yolande lead us and the rest join hands and follow in unison. If Luo Luo Zheng gets away, we'll be in immense crisis. With Fabian and Esther staying with us, it means by then, not only my companions and I will crumble, but Fabian and Esther won't be able to escape the fate of being assassinated by Dark Nether Death Light either.</p>

  <p>This isn't an awful deal after all, ' Malcom thought. He felt the urge to haggle. Before he could do that, Yolande cut him short. "If you refuse, don't bother to come along."</p>

  <p>Yolande's threat worked. On second thought, Malcom found that her idea might not be bad. Their safety would be guaranteed, meaning they would be protected to a particular degree.</p>

  <p>When they had all come into a concession, Shane's countenance instantly altered. He gazed at something, his eyes narrowed. He whirled his protective life vitality and then darted out of the orange colored barrier!</p>

  <p>His protective life vitality had the ability to resist Dark Nether Death Light for now. The others couldn't hold their horses. Everyone was so curious about what had intrigued Shane. Something must have fascinated him. Was there a probability that he had discovered some kind of lucky charm?</p>

  <p>Everyone brushed off the theory. Shane had a particular norm of picking up unnecessary stuff along the way. Maybe he had likewise discovered some broken stuff and decided to pick it up too, so everyone let the activity slide.</p>

  <p>Shane dashed off to a hillside. On it there was this extraordinary plant with only two leaves. The two emerald green leaves exuded a dark green luster.</p>

  <p>The others spotted the plant too. 'No matter what this guy has discovered, eventually I will have it, ' Malcom thought, a sneer creeping over his face.</p>

  <p>Excitement could be read in Esther's and Fabian's faces. That plant was clearly extraordinary.</p>

  <p>But just at this moment, the expression on Yolande's puppet-like face changed drastically as she sprinted to urge Luo Luo Zheng, "Leave! Speed up!"</p>

  <p>"What?" Luo Luo Zheng was not offered a space to assert more sound. She dragged him as he hastened.</p>

  <p>The orange light barrier moved quickly with Luo Luo Zheng. Everyone looked at Yolande, who usually was calm. Her pale face shocked them. After all, this was a dangerous place. They all started to flee. In an instant, they all ran into the light barrier and kept on running.</p>

  <p>Shane marched on to the plant, but something weird happened just before he spread his hand out to dig it out. The plant suddenly grew taller and a small bud quickly surfaced in the middle of the two leaves.</p>

  <p>The bud blossomed. The mysterious part was that in bloom was an incomparably strange face instead of a flower. The odd face rumbled as a lion at Shane. Everyone glanced as Shane's protective life vitality instantly dissipated. Afterwards his skin instantly disappeared, revealing the fresh red flesh, and very soon, the flesh also proceeded to disintegrate, exposing his white bones.</p>

  <p>After all this, the bones were not spared. They disappeared into thin air. The only item that was spared was a few fragments of clothing that hovered in the air before dropping on the ground.</p>

  <p>"What in God's name could this be?" Malcom exclaimed, dumbstruck.</p>

  <p>Shane's wretched state freaked the misery out of him.</p>

  <p>Fabian shook his head. "Who the hell knows? Here anything is achievable, so be ready to face the impossible!" he said.</p>

  <p>"But that thing has no hands or feet. It won't be chasing us, right?" Jarrod asked.</p>

  <p>Yolande didn't answer. Instead, she continued running in front along with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As soon as Jarrod finished speaking, a touch of green appeared in front of the crowd. Everyone glanced over and saw that the green leaves were exactly the same as the ones they had seen earlier. Clearly the plant had just emerged from under the ground.</p>

  <p>Everyone finally understood why Yolande had asked Luo Luo Zheng to run. The plant indeed had no hands or legs, but it was able to travel underground!</p>
