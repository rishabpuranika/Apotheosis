<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Pearce rushed at Emperor Di Jun, he ordered his men to remove the Cage of Heaven and Earth.</p>

  <p>The cage was only capable of trapping the members of the Bearing race, and would be ineffective against Emperor Di Jun. In fact, it restricted the activities of their own people.</p>

  <p>It was Pearce's first encounter with the Starlight Tracking Spear and although he did not know its origin, he kept guessing at it.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful an Other Shore Token was, there was always a way to destroy it!</p>

  <p>The Starlight Tracking Spear was no doubt intimidating, but there should be some rules contained within it. If he could figure out the rules, he could definitely break the spear.</p>

  <p>Judging by the way Emperor Di Jun used it, it seemed he could only attack those whose heads were covered by the starlight.</p>

  <p>So if one could avoid the starlight, one would avoid Emperor Di Jun's attack too.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>With the sudden tremor of the space, the Cage of Heaven and Earth was removed.</p>

  <p>Pearce was well prepared, disappearing the second the cage was lifted. He then reappeared behind Emperor Di Jun, faster than the eye could see.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun hadn't expected the cage to be removed so suddenly. He was even more surprised at Pearce's bold head-on attack!</p>

  <p>He had forgotten... that the powerful warriors following Eastern Emperor Taiyi were hardened from hundreds of battles. The fear of death didn't even make them flinch.</p>

  <p>"Equinox Flower, bloom!"</p>

  <p>A huge red flower emerged above Pearce's head in full bloom, shimmering beautifully!</p>

  <p>"Emperor Di Jun, this is where you'll stay for the time being,"</p>

  <p>Pearce said as a space illusion enveloped Emperor Di Jun, trapping him inside.</p>

  <p>Playing a trick of space on Emperor Di Jun was like juggling before a king.</p>

  <p>He had little difficulty avoiding the Cage of Heaven and Earth, so this illusory space he was now in wouldn't be tough to handle.</p>

  <p>Small squares appeared on the surface of his body, and he quickly shuttled through the illusory space.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh...</p>

  <p>There were lights and shadows of different colors all over. Red, white, black, yellow, green, blue and purple were spread throughout as if countless dye tanks had burst and spilled into space.</p>

  <p>He traveled through but could not find a way out!</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors in the sky gathered around Pearce when Emperor Di Jun had been trapped.</p>

  <p>They could not see Emperor Di Jun from the outside of the Equinox Flower.</p>

  <p>The Equinox Flower was capable of creating a truly strange space, formed of many layers upon layers that locked him in. This was what made it difficult for even a powerful warrior like Emperor Di Jun to speedily find an escape.</p>

  <p>But even if he couldn't find a way out now, it certainly did not mean he would never find one.</p>

  <p>"I can't hold him in for too long," Pearce said in a low voice, deep in focus.</p>

  <p>"Only working together will allow us to deal with him effectively!"</p>

  <p>Defeating a powerful warrior like Emperor Di Jun would prove difficult in a head-on fight.</p>

  <p>However, all of the powerful warriors present had merged with unique Other Shore Tokens. If they could make good use of their Other Shore Tokens' abilities and rely on their mechanisms, they might stand a chance.</p>

  <p>"His speed is too fast. There is almost no way to grab hold of him. When he gets out of Elder Pearce's illusory space, we will not be able to catch him," said a warrior from the Bright Mountain worriedly.</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, Felicity of the Origin Mountain gently waved her hand, and a small cross arrow appeared in her palm. "I have an Other Shore Token. Although it can't capture Emperor Di Jun, it's enough to hold him down in a certain spot!"</p>

  <p>When Auden saw the cross arrow, his eyes gleamed. "That is the Heavenly Immobilizing Marker!"</p>

  <p>Felicity nodded.</p>

  <p>Anyone targeted by the Heavenly Immobilizing Marker would be pulled back to their original position no matter how far away they had gotten, as long as the owner held the thought in their mind.</p>

  <p>As an Other Shore Token of Stage Thirty-two, the Other Shore Power it could unleash was only dozens of Jun. Because of this, once anyone was located by the Heavenly Immobilizing Marker, there was absolutely no possibility of getting rid of it!</p>

  <p>"That makes it a lot easier!" "When Emperor Di Jun escapes from the Equinox Flower, he will definitely attempt to teleport away. That's when Felicity can use her Other Shore Token to pull him back!" another middle-aged man suggested.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he took out an Other Shore Token as well. It was a huge bone stick, also dug out from one of the upper stages on the Other Shore. As an Other Shore Token of strengthening type, the bone stick could unleash an astonishing power.</p>

  <p>Beside the middle-aged man was an old man who held a mirror. When the middle-aged man looked into the mirror, there soon appeared his reflection, who also held a bone stick in his hand and looked powerful and majestic.</p>

  <p>The warriors readied themselves to launch the fatal blow once Emperor Di Jun escaped the illusory space.</p>

  <p>Pearce grew more and more cautious as he stared the Equinox Flower before him. "He seems to have found the flaw and is breaking through!"</p>

  <p>The layers of space were like the layers of petals on a rose, tightly wrapped around the real exit.</p>

  <p>But Emperor Di Jun's knowledge in space was remarkable and in just a few moments he had already seen through the layers and began breaking through as if bursting from a cocoon.</p>

  <p>Pearce was proud to have trapped him for as long as he did.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...</p>

  <p>Within the Equinox Flower, Emperor Di Jun casually opened the layers of space following the invisible veins. When he reached the last layer, he suddenly halted his outstretched hand. "There are a total of nine hundred and ninety-seven layers in this space. This is the last layer," he muttered to himself calmly.</p>

  <p>The slightest smile broke out and a trace of mockery appeared in his eyes.</p>

  <p>He did not break through the last layer, but raised the Starlight Tracking Spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>Pearce's nerves were rattled as he continued to stare at Emperor Di Jun in the Equinox Flower. "Everyone, get ready. He is coming... Oh no!"</p>

  <p>When he saw that Emperor Di Jun had raised the Starlight Tracking Spear, his eyes narrowed before shooting wide open again in shock and terror.</p>

  <p>"Rigoberto! Atticus! You..."</p>

  <p>Just then, a figure appeared on the backs of Rigoberto, Atticus and four other warriors.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>The spear pierced through the six of them.</p>

  <p>Five of the six shadowy figures of Emperor Di Jun that stood behind them disappeared in the blink of an eye, save for the one behind Rigoberto. With a gentle flap of his wings, innumerable little squares appeared on his body and he disappeared instantaneously. The next moment, he appeared in the sky once more.</p>

  <p>He had used the power of the Starlight Tracking Spear to escape the Equinox Flower, hiding behind one of six warriors as protection from any attack. Naturally, he had escaped quite easily after that.</p>

  <p>He looked down at Pearce and said condescendingly, "What a childish and ridiculous game..."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he noticed a strange look on Pearce's face. Before he could finish his words, six threads suddenly emerged from his body with figures at the end of them, figures of the six he had just killed. They now looked cold and lifeless like zombies at the end of the strings.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Emperor Di Jun had exerted six rays of Starlight Witness on those including Rigoberto, Atticus and the other four warriors.</p>

  <p>Pearce had been thinking of a solution to counter his skill this whole time.</p>

  <p>Emperor Di Jun could come and go freely in the space. Even if he could trap him in the Equinox Flower, it could not imprison him permanently. It was almost impossible to seize him and attack.</p>

  <p>In the end, he was left with no choice but to try to make some headway in this fight through the sacrifice of Rigoberto, Atticus and the other four.</p>
