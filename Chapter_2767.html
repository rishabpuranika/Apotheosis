  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned. He got the feeling that the water current in the distance was constantly converging into tiny spirals.</p>

  <p>These spirals were like thin, long needles that gathered together and shot towards Zheng and Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" they called out in unison, then turned around and waded through the dark water.</p>

  <p>"Water Resisting Technique!"</p>

  <p>The internal momentum inside Zheng's body bloomed.</p>

  <p>This skill enabled people to resist water and belonged to the Parting Water Godly Way. A smooth membrane of water formed on the surface of his body.</p>

  <p>Zheng found it difficult to employ this skill in the dark water but it still had the power to speed him up.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen flew at a high speed, but the spirals formed by the water were faster.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of tiny spirals of water currents followed them, forming a large net and enveloping both of them.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng heard a baby's cry in the dark water.</p>

  <p>"This cry!"</p>

  <p>"That's the sound of the Devil's laughter. It sounds like the cry of a three-year-old child," Sword Chen said, looking serious.</p>

  <p>The Sea of Meditation was vast.</p>

  <p>Meeting the Devil was a rare event.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had hidden in the dark water for many years, and had only encountered the Devils twice.</p>

  <p>When he had first met the Devil, he had escaped by sheer luck. When he had encountered the Devil the second time, the fiends had led the Devil away.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Zheng had stepped into the Sea of Meditation, and he had already encountered a Devil.</p>

  <p>It looked like his bad luck had reigned.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the spirals had approached Zheng and Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Both of them drew their swords in unison.</p>

  <p>Splash, splash...</p>

  <p>It was a characteristic of the dark water that any power unleashed in it would be greatly weakened.</p>

  <p>Zheng launched a sword attack and moments later, the dark water had suppressed the sword radiance, causing it to become weak and considerably slow down.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned as he looked at the slowly-spreading sword radiance.</p>

  <p>In contrast, the sword radiance that Sword Chen had created was much stronger than Zheng's.</p>

  <p>As he brandished the sword, it emitted an exquisite sword radiance.</p>

  <p>Almost half the power that he controlled was from the force of primitive fear in the dark water.</p>

  <p>When the sword radiance met the spiral water currents, they annihilated each other and produced a swarm of bubbles.</p>

  <p>When the spiral water currents approached Zheng, it took him three sword strikes to demolish eight of the spirals.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen, on the other hand, launched twelve attacks.</p>

  <p>Twelve thin lines spread out of his sword and brought down close to forty spiral currents.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen and Zheng worked together to break the cage that the spiral water had formed and escaped from one end.</p>

  <p>"Keep moving!"</p>

  <p>Sword Chen and Zheng ran on the water bed, while the baby's cry continued to sound above their heads. The voice became hoarser and more annoying by the minute.</p>

  <p>"It is ridiculous, isn't it? It is unable to prove the existence of such a creature, but it can use such a powerful skill!" Zheng said, as they flew through the water.</p>

  <p>"I have thought about this before," Sword Chen said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>These unknown creatures were, in essence, very different from other vicious creatures.</p>

  <p>Although the fiends and other fierce beasts were not real creatures, they had also been formed by the Faith Energy that could be seen and touched in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>While there was no way to prove the existence of these unknown things, they were able to kill people and go on a rampage. Nothing made sense anymore!</p>

  <p>"The fact that they can attack has proved their existence," Zheng said as he looked up through the dark water.</p>

  <p>"It's just that we can't find them."</p>

  <p>Numerous spirals of water appeared again and enveloped both of them from above.</p>

  <p>"On your left!"</p>

  <p>A Devil had attacked them. Zheng and Sword Chen retaliated back together.</p>

  <p>Although they couldn't kill the Devil, all they had to do was to cut off the spiral currents.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Sword Chen waved their swords simultaneously to the left, cutting off dozens of spiral water flows coming at them.</p>

  <p>"You mean that we just couldn't find them?" Sword Chen asked, confused.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had lived in the Sea of Meditation for many years to hide as well as to improve his cultivation.</p>

  <p>Over these years, he had realized that the Sea of Meditation was a complex concept in itself.</p>

  <p>After all, the fiends also attached great importance to this place.</p>

  <p>And when he had encountered the Devil last time, he had found that the fiends paid quite a bit of attention to the Devil. They had even led the Devil away from Sword Chen, even though it had cost them a fellow fiend's life.</p>

  <p>The fiends were selfish and would never spare Sword Chen's life.</p>

  <p>They were willing to seize any opportunity to kill Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>There probably was something wrong with the attitude of the fiends at the time.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng said thoughtfully. "We just can't find a way to find them."</p>

  <p>"Three thousand feet to your left. Stab the second sword there," Sword Chen said suddenly.</p>

  <p>Having been chased by the Devil all this way, it turned out that they had arrived at the second position in the sword array that Sword Chen had arranged.</p>

  <p>They were still in danger and they knew they wouldn't die fighting just one Devil.</p>

  <p>With a gentle sweep of his spiritual sense, Zheng found the place where Sword Chen had previously inserted the sword.</p>

  <p>He threw out his long sword and it pierced the stone there.</p>

  <p>"Let's stop here today. Let's go back to the bubble first," said Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Other unknown things would only cause a little bit of an interference to them at most.</p>

  <p>But if they weren't careful enough, the Devil would probably chase and kill them, which was why it would be better for them to avoid it for the time being.</p>

  <p>"Okay,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said, nodding, and they both moved upwards.</p>

  <p>But the moment they changed direction, more howls rang out from above them.</p>

  <p>This time, there were more and more strange screams, indicating the presence of multiple Devils above them.</p>

  <p>Both of them paled.</p>

  <p>"What should we..."</p>

  <p>Zheng wanted to ask.</p>

  <p>But before he could do so, a number of spiral currents appeared in the dark water, flying downwards like raindrops.</p>

  <p>It was strange to see rain in the water, but Zheng and Sword Chen weren't interested in the wonder that it provided.</p>

  <p>Swish, swish, swish...</p>

  <p>The spiral water currents cut a path between Zheng and Sword Chen, parting them from each other.</p>

  <p>One of the spiral water currents hit Zheng's arm.</p>

  <p>He felt a sharp pain, and he bent down to see a tiny hole on his arm.</p>

  <p>The water current had even penetrated into Zheng's bones.</p>

  <p>Under such great pressure, Zheng had no choice but to keep retreating.</p>

  <p>As he retreated this time, he stepped out from under the golden light of the Scorching Gold.</p>

  <p>And now that Zheng had lost the protection of the golden light, all the unknown things that had been lurking around him, surged towards him.</p>
