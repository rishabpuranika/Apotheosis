<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>On the other side of Willow Island, tens of thousands of warriors were gathering together in a large square.</p>

  <p>The journey into the Orange Sea World was a great opportunity for these warriors to spar with the talents of the thirteen palaces. Not only that, if they got to injure or kill any talent, they'd receive quite a number of rewards.</p>

  <p>And it was these rewards that made them salivate with greed.</p>

  <p>However, this round of Passing the Torch was coming to an end. They could only wait until the next Passing the Torch if they wanted to participate.</p>

  <p>"There are one hundred and sixty-one opponents in the last round?</p>

  <p>Shouldn't the test be over?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It's not two hundred, so those warriors should be the last group.</p>

  <p>However, they have now especially arranged two warriors to fight!"</p>

  <p>"If my guess is correct then this fight is going to be a good one! These two people should be extremely special or outstanding! A test with only the two of these warriors could only mean that they are going to be exceptional!"</p>

  <p>"Outstanding? Exceptional? It's just two Life and Death Realm martial artists. I bet that kid at the fifth level won't even pass our first round of sparring!" This first round of sparring referred to Luo Zheng's eleventh round of test. Because these martial artists had only started to get involved in the Illusion Space from the eleventh round, those who got eliminated in the first ten rounds had no chance of ever meeting with these warriors.</p>

  <p>The warriors all talked amongst themselves as they observed both Luo Luo Zheng and Layla through the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>"No matter what, we'll just have to wait and see how our buddies will perform for this round?"</p>

  <p>The warriors had all been strictly subdivided according to their strength, with the more powerful ones going into the arena in the later rounds.</p>

  <p>Back in the Illusion Space, both Luo Luo Zheng and Layla were quickly swarmed by their opponents.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for them to easily defeat these warriors by simply slashing at them with their swords. Their opponents were all living, thinking beings who used various strategies to fight them: some ran away, others faked their movements, while a few had decided to launch fierce, all-out attacks.</p>

  <p>However, their cultivation method was still very limited. Their only strength came from their sheer number but they were all basically only at the seventh or eighth level of the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>They were a mere two or three levels higher than Luo Luo Zheng and posed no threat to him whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Several lights burst forth from the Thunder Wind Divine Sword!</p>

  <p>"Ahh?"</p>

  <p>The lights shot out and instantly killed four people. The other thirteen were fortunate enough to have used their movement techniques and managed to avoid the sharp lights.</p>

  <p>The warriors were mere projections in this Illusion Space and couldn't really die. However, they felt all the pain that their opponents inflicted upon them.</p>

  <p>"Kill him!"</p>

  <p>"Moon Splitting Slash!"</p>

  <p>"Cyan Nether Swordsmanship!"</p>

  <p>They all shouted simultaneously, pointing all sorts of weapons at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, he was already gone before they could even land a strike! Luo Luo Zheng had zoomed past them swiftly and reappeared behind them. He raised his sword above his head.</p>

  <p>"Nether God Shadow!"</p>

  <p id="top_19">"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>With a wave of his sword, thirteen Nether God Shadows shot out from his sword!</p>

  <p>This was the first time he had ever used this technique in combat.</p>

  <p>To his relief, the shadows did not disappoint. Each one had its own method to attack as they charged towards his opponents.</p>

  <p>In an instant, the thirteen remaining warriors had been ripped to shreds by the Nether God Shadows, and then were kicked out of the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>Although this could be considered impressive, the four thousand warriors from the thirteen palaces who were watching them did not feel that this was a big deal. All of them had already gone through the eleven rounds of tests and had already proven themselves in handling these opponents.</p>

  <p>Still, they couldn't help but nod appreciatively at these Nether God Shadows that Luo Luo Zheng had managed to summon to deal with his opponents.</p>

  <p>The warriors on the other side of Willow Island were a bit more dumbstruck at what they had witnessed.</p>

  <p>Like they had speculated, they knew Luo Luo Zheng and Layla were somewhat special since they were the ones that participated in the Illusion Space test as a separate group.</p>

  <p>However, they never imagined that they would be surprised by a mere fifth-level Life and Death Realm warrior!</p>

  <p>The warriors that young man had killed with a single strike were all two or three levels higher than him! How did he do that? None of them knew.</p>

  <p>In fact, all of them were currently rendered speechless by what they had just witnessed.</p>

  <p>"I finally know the strength of the Heavenly Alliance's top talents?"</p>

  <p>"The thirteen palaces are the places to gather young talents to send to the alliance. These young ones all need to grow before they become true super talents. I can't imagine how terrifying those freaks in the Spring Fragrance Pavilion and the Gauze Pavilion are..."</p>

  <p>"Hmph! We'll definitely be able to defeat that kid!"</p>

  <p>Someone harrumphed. These warriors were all only slightly inferior to the talents of the thirteen palaces but they were still core members within their sacred places. They all had pride and strength. There was no way they could be killed by Luo Luo Zheng that easily.</p>

  <p>He might have passed the eleventh round, but there was still the twelfth round waiting for him. They were going to send in their most powerful warriors to fight him!</p>

  <p>They were all so focused on Luo Zheng's combat strength but the Sunset World lord was more concerned about the Nether God Shadows Luo Luo Zheng had summoned?</p>

  <p>"How did he do that?" a palace leader asked in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Kyron's Thunder Wind Divine Sword was quite famous in the past.</p>

  <p>"Shouldn't there only be three Nether God Shadows?" the Sunset World lord muttered strangely.</p>

  <p>"This fellow managed to produce thirteen Nether God Shadows in one go. Is it because of the powerful sword or the capable young man?" another palace leader asked.</p>

  <p>Yolande chuckled at their remarks. "Of course it's because of Luo Luo Zheng! Kyron was the one who taught him the 'Nether God Mind Method.' He himself was only able to make three Nether God Shadows come out back then.</p>

  <p>Who would've thought Luo Luo Zheng would be able to create thirteen..."</p>

  <p>Yolande's words rendered the palace leaders speechless.</p>

  <p>As for Layla?</p>

  <p>She had also rendered her opponents speechless once they realized that the person they were supposed to fight was a woman, and more than that, a beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>However, they mostly respected her as an opponent, though a few still threw out some obscene words.</p>

  <p>They couldn't resist the pleasure of teasing such a beautiful and talented woman from the thirteen palaces. There was really nothing to lose once they entered the Illusion Space since they couldn't really die in there.</p>

  <p>They forgot that despite not really dying, Layla could still make them suffer intense pain while inside the space.</p>

  <p>She raised her cyan long sword that began to vibrate at a high frequency.</p>

  <p>A ripple had been created by this sword and began to spread around the vicinity. These ripples were invisible to the naked eye. Layla had used this method in the first ten rounds but, this time, the long sword vibrated even faster. It was a similar technique but with a slight twist.</p>

  <p>During this moment, the warriors all began to charge towards her. Some were not even charging to fight but to do something dirty to Layla.</p>

  <p>However, not one of them could even lay a single strike on her. The fastest of them, after getting at least twenty feet away from Layla suddenly began to feel his heart beat strangely!</p>

  <p>In fact, all of them found it hard to breathe and control their bodies.</p>

  <p>And then, an intense pain suddenly burst from their cinnabar field!</p>

  <p>A warrior would typically pass out once the pain became too much for his physical body to bear. However, they all remained conscious despite being tortured by the vibrations of Layla's sword.</p>

  <p>It was as if they were prisoners who were constantly being tortured and woken up with cold water.</p>

  <p>The pain was too much and they all wished they could 'die' as fast as possible to escape the suffering in this Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>That was when they realized that they might have underestimated their opponent. Layla might have looked unsophisticated but she was very capable of making sure her enemies suffered for doing her wrong.</p>

  <p>Right now, she shifted her focus from competing with Luo Luo Zheng to accurately controlling the pain her opponents were feeling instead.</p>

  <p>It lasted for a few seconds, a minute, a few minutes? but it felt like hundreds of years for these warriors!</p>

  <p>At that moment, voice of the old man in cotton clothes rang out, "Layla, stop?" he murmured magnanimously. These martial artists had been invited by the thirteen palaces, after all. It wouldn't be too good if she went on to torture them like this.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" she scoffed.</p>

  <p>Layla drew a circle with the tip of her sword, her ten feet long black hair casting down from her chest, waist, and going all the way to her legs.</p>

  <p>The end of her hair spread spirally as she stabbed the sword into the platform and used her finger to lightly flick on its steel surface, producing a clear, metallic sound.</p>

  <p>"Pop?"</p>

  <p>The suffering warriors instantly exploded into a bloody mist.</p>
