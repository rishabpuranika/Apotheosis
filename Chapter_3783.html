<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>It was at this very moment that Zheng grew confused and weary. The space turned out to be too strange for his understanding.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, it was not created by his illusion because it actually existed.</p>

  <p>But how was he dragged here if he was just at the bone cave?</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven, do you know where this place is?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven scanned the vicinity in an attempt to familiarize himself.</p>

  <p>"Did you touch two threads just now?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>"The two threads must be Dragon Threads," the Primeval Lord of Heaven explained.</p>

  <p>"Dragon Threads? What are they? What is their use?" Zheng asked rapidly.</p>

  <p>Because the Other Shore Tokens of mysterious type were too complicated, it was notably impossible to guard against them.</p>

  <p>"Think of the Dragon Thread as a space treasure. Once it is activated, it can pull you into a special space," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered.</p>

  <p>"It took me into a different space? So you're saying that I'm no longer in the Sanskrit Light Stage?" Zheng gasped.</p>

  <p>"You are there, but you are not," the Primeval Lord of Heaven responded calmly.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Zheng paced back and forth, trying to understand.</p>

  <p>"Let me ask you first. Where exactly were you when you were in the Sanskrit Light Stage? Were you specifically in the Bloom Divine Province or just the Sanskrit Light Stage?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, looking at Zheng with a suspicious expression.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was about to speak, he hesitated. He then opened his mouth to speak again. "I...I believe I was in both of them..."</p>

  <p>During this time, Zheng's corporeal body actually existed in the Bloom Divine Province, while another body existed on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"So what if there exists a place within a place? For example, an Other Shore of the Other Shore?" The Primeval Lord of Heaven spoke slowly, making sure Zheng absorbed each and every word.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Dragon Thread was connected to a special space, and this was merely demonstrated as an Other Shore within the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>When they first discovered the Dragon Thread and its properties, many powerful warriors of the Eternal Realm travelled far and wide to collect it, hoping to find its secrets within the space.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, the space was completely empty, which left them to assume that the Other Shore within the Other Shore was meaningless.</p>

  <p>Because the powerful warriors of the Eternal Realm were all geniuses, someone eventually discovered the use of the Dragon Thread. Apparently, it could help the activator send his or her opponent into the space.</p>

  <p>With full training and understanding, one could even utilize the Dragon Thread to not only bring his opponent to the space, but also kill him. This was most probably the most significant feature of the Dragon Thread.</p>

  <p>Once he heard the explanation of the Primeval Lord of Heaven, Zheng pursed his lips. "Are you telling me that I have an opponent waiting for me at the end of the space?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded once. "I believe so."</p>

  <p>"Well, who is it? Is it an Other Shore creature?" Zheng asked persistently.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered monotonously.</p>

  <p>"The Dragon Thread is quite strange. It can be activated by creatures in the chaos, as well as by creatures on the Other Shore. However, if it was activated by a creature in the chaos, something must have been wrong with your physical body in the Bloom Divine Province already."</p>

  <p>Zheng had no idea that his body was already pulled up into the air. The powerful warriors of the Oneness Sky Palace, including Pearce and Auden, rose into the air and floated beside "Zheng" as well.</p>

  <p>Confusion and anxiety were written all over their faces.</p>

  <p>"Zheng is now in the Land of Bone Tribulation. If that is so, who is in the Sanskrit Light Stage?" Pearce asked almost as if he was screaming. His voice spread out like thunder, demanding a response.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Athemar flew straight up and bowed to Pearce. "I heard that the passage in the Sanskrit Light Stage was destroyed. Libby is the only one member of the Oneness Sky Palace who remains in the Sanskrit Light Stage."</p>

  <p>"Wake her up then," Pearce spat.</p>

  <p>If this were any other day, they would never wake up Libby, especially because she was a well-respected genius.</p>

  <p>But this moment was different, not to mention Zheng was too important to the Oneness Sky Palace, so that they could not take a risk. They had no choice but to wake up the warrior from her meditation.</p>

  <p>Just as Athemar was about to wake up Libby, they caught her floating towards them. She fixed her eyes right at Zheng, who remained up in the air.</p>

  <p>Her face was filled with astonishment.</p>

  <p>"So Zheng is also entangled by the threads here?" Libby scoffed.</p>

  <p>"What on earth happened on the Other Shore?" Pearce asked again, unable to understand the entire situation.</p>

  <p>"After Zheng moved the bone away, he ended up touching the two threads..."</p>

  <p>Libby continued on to explain to them what had occurred in the Sanskrit Light Stage.</p>

  <p>After they heard the whole story, Auden frowned. "Well, it is good news that Zheng has cultivated the Myriad Tribulations Body. However, whoever dared to use the Dragon Threads must have been fully prepared. I'm afraid only a strong opponent exists in that space."</p>

  <p>Pearce shook his head in helplessness. He expected Zheng's opponent to be no less than an Eternal Warrior of the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>Moreover, now that the Dragon Threads appeared in the Bloom Divine Province, it only meant one thing: the one who set up the threads was a member of the chaos.</p>

  <p>Just as Pearce tried to guess who that might be, a huge shadow appeared in the sky, right above the Bloom Divine Province.</p>

  <p>Everyone looked up and their jaws dropped. It was a giant red tortoise.</p>

  <p>As they observed, they saw that the edge of the tortoise's shell was serrated.</p>

  <p>Its eyes emitted strong killing intent, making anyone who looked at it uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"The Blood Spirit Tortoise!"</p>

  <p>"One of the ten most ferocious beasts in the chaos!"</p>

  <p>"Why is its shadow projected here?"</p>

  <p>The powerful warriors of all the other mountains also gathered and looked at the magnificent Blood Spirit Tortoise that hovered in the sky.</p>

  <p>Among all top ten ferocious beasts of the chaos, the Blood Spirit Tortoise was one that rarely appeared. Over the years, people had only seen it one or two times, and no one knew its standpoint.</p>

  <p>It was also said that the Blood Spirit Tortoise was not merely a creature, as it carried an entire city on its back. On the shell of the tortoise resided the Blood Spirit race.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the fact that the Blood Spirit race lived on its back was the main reason the Blood Spirit Tortoise did not appear often. However, despite this, their strength could not be underestimated.</p>

  <p>"Look at this. Such losers of the Oneness Sky Palace..." the Blood Spirit Tortoise said. "From now on, the Bloom Divine Province is under my authority. If you don't want to die, kneel down to save your damn lives!"</p>

  <p>Its voice echoed like thunder, and it spread throughout the entire Bloom Divine Province with a roaring vibration.</p>

  <p>The trillions of people in the Bloom Divine Province pointed at the sky, horrified and worried. Among them, the cowardly ones actually got down on their knees just as the tortoise ordered.</p>

  <p>Previously, the Sun Crow race failed to occupy the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, the Element Spirit race did not give up.</p>

  <p>However, both Yellow Thearch and Divine Farmer feared the strength of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Though the Element Spirit race ordered them to take over the Bloom Divine Province and attack Zheng, the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race did not budge at all.</p>

  <p>It was through the death of Emperor Charm that they knew about the energy souls released by Zheng.</p>

  <p>After he passed the test of the Soul City, Zheng made his way to the Land of Bone Tribulation.</p>

  <p>This was the reason for the Element Spirit race and Yellow Thearch's plan.</p>

  <p>They ordered the Blood Spirit Tortoise to place the Dragon Threads that would confine Zheng at the Other Shore of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>As long as the energy souls were not released, only the powerful warriors of the Holy Soul Realm were left in the Bloom Divine Province. These warriors were not enough to put up a battle against the warriors of the Eternal Realm.</p>
