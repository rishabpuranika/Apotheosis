<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The seats of all the True Gods in the hall were already pre-arranged.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings of other wealthy clans on the Floating Islands weren't welcome in the Sunrest Tree Region.</p>

  <p>So those who sent the elite disciples to join the debate over the Godly Ways were all consummate True Gods of wealthy clans.</p>

  <p>All the warriors gathered on the stairs of the hall were the disciples of wealthy clans— they were made up of about two hundred top-rank True Gods and even some consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred top-rank True Gods with humble backgrounds stood at the foot of the stairs.</p>

  <p>Majority of the hundred top-rank True Gods came from the first-tier clans, many of which had consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings— they were also powerful forces in the divine land.</p>

  <p>But in the eyes of the Floating Islands' disciples, they were merely warriors from grassroots.</p>

  <p>"Nice to meet you two again!" Enoch greeted Zheng and Yan with a hearty smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng returned his greeting with a nod while his eyes were fixed on the stairs.</p>

  <p>There were too many familiar faces there.</p>

  <p>Troy, Rachelle, Alfredo…</p>

  <p>When Enoch noticed where Zheng's gaze was, he assumed Zheng was ready to run up the stairs so he quickly said, "Our seats are at the foot of the stairs.</p>

  <p>The seats on the stairs are for disciples from the Floating Islands. We— "</p>

  <p>But before he could finish his sentence, a clear, sharp voice resounded in their ears.</p>

  <p>"Wow! Guess who's here? He's been hiding away for two years. Tell me, why didn't you just hide for a lifetime like a coward?"</p>

  <p>It was Rachelle speaking, clad in a light red dress. As a consummate True God, she couldn't participate in the debate. But she still came over through the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Although in that dress, she didn't seem as valiant and heroic as she used to be, it made her look more feminine.</p>

  <p>But the top-rank True Gods in the hall more or less knew of her short temper. They took quick, discreet glances at her before averting their eyes.</p>

  <p>After three people entered the hall, they didn't expect Rachelle to scold one of them coldly right off the bat. They all wondered who had the nerve to provoke the Mu Clan and its consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Even Enoch was shocked when he turned around and saw Rachelle walking gracefully down the stairs.</p>

  <p>Though he didn't know Rachelle personally, he had overheard people gossiping about her and realized that she was the famous figure.</p>

  <p>With a long face, Enoch asked in a low voice, "How exactly did you offend the Mu Clan?"</p>

  <p>"That's none of your business," Zheng responded calmly.</p>

  <p>When Enoch opened his mouth, no words seemed to escape. While he felt embarrassed about shrinking back, he knew better than to offend the people on the stairs. If he didn't handle the situation properly, he would probably cause great trouble for his clan. He had no choice but to step aside obediently.</p>

  <p>Carefully, Zheng examined Rachelle. Without saying a word, he reached his hand out to her face as if he were holding something in his hand.</p>

  <p>The move made the onlookers feel somewhat inexplicable.</p>

  <p>But Troy, Walton, and Shahn knew what the gesture meant.</p>

  <p>The words Zheng had said as he raised Rachelle's chin in the past were probably the greatest humiliation she had ever suffered in her life.</p>

  <p>Though she had failed a number of times against Harold in the Arena of Legends, she had never been so livid.</p>

  <p>When Zheng released her from the world within the jade seal, Rachelle managed to recover after a long period of depression.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!"</p>

  <p>Blood gushed from the vessels in her neck.</p>

  <p>Her extremely beautiful face then began to twist.</p>

  <p>Strong killing intent grew in her heart, but under the influence of the Truth of Goodwill in the Non-combat Zone, her killing intent quickly dissipated.</p>

  <p>The process was truly difficult for her to bear.</p>

  <p>"So what does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"How could a move irritate her so much?"</p>

  <p>The top-rank True Gods of both the wealthy and grassroots clans whispered among themselves, wondering why Rachelle would be so affected by a seemingly insignificant gesture.</p>

  <p>Enoch was one of them. In his eyes, Zheng was a mere low-rank True God as week as an ant before Rachelle.</p>

  <p>How could such a gesture provoke her so?</p>

  <p>Although the disciples of the Floating Islands had more or less heard of things happening in the Time Sea Forbidden Land, no else was aware of what had happened in the world within the jade seal. They only knew that Zheng had controlled the jade seal and defeated all the consummate True Gods somehow.</p>

  <p>After what seemed like forever in the heavy silence, Rachelle finally calmed down.</p>

  <p>She then raised her head and sneered coldly. "Sooner or later, you will fall into my hands! Then, I will make you useless and imprison you with my silly sister. I will torture you bit by bit in front of her until she understands what reality means."</p>

  <p>"Nelly? She has been imprisoned?" Zheng frowned at the news.</p>

  <p>Rachelle only snorted in response.</p>

  <p>Behind the facade, she knew not to dare irritate Zheng with the matter. In her eyes, it was the shame of the Mu Clan— she couldn't let others know.</p>

  <p>Nelly had truly disappointed her with what she had done in the Time Sea Forbidden Land. And when she knew what was on Nelly's mind, Rachelle grew even more furious.</p>

  <p>She personally ordered her to be locked up and until now, she hadn't let Nelly out of her cell.</p>

  <p>But Nelly was just as stubborn as her sister, unwilling to yield to her even after such a long time.</p>

  <p>Rachelle's gaze slowly shifted to Harold as she coldly said, "Your plan is good but unfortunately, this time, you're doomed to fall to defeat. I don't know if there's a good end for you in this situation."</p>

  <p>On the other end, Harold looked as calm as still water.</p>

  <p>Before Harold took control of the Everest Spirit Mountain, he had already become the top warrior among the consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>Among the consummate True Gods of the Floating Islands, the only person qualified to fight him was Troy.</p>

  <p>Harold could control the Everest Spirit Mountain completely, enhancing his strength to another level. All this time, he had managed to distance himself from the consummate True Gods and now, he could fight against Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"I will be defeated, you say?" Harold sneered. "How many times have you lost to me? I've lost count. Do you remember?"</p>

  <p>The look in Rachelle's eyes darkened at his words. She seemed to have remembered something before she returned the sneer. "Then I hope you can succeed this time." With the last word, she turned around and went back to her seat.</p>

  <p>On the stairs, the top-rank True Gods from the Floating Islands, including the Mu Clan, the Dongfang Clan, the Tang Clan, and the Fang Clan, all cast hostile glares at Zheng, Yan, and Harold.</p>

  <p>Yan followed Zheng quietly.</p>

  <p>She was no longer the ignorant girl she used to be. She knew that her brother had almost died at the hands of this woman and that the latter must have already made adequate preparations. Yan knew not to underestimate her.</p>

  <p>Harold led Zheng and Yan to the stairs where they seated themselves on spots belonging to the Luo Clan. Yan leaned over and whispered, "Zheng, I'm afraid they will aim at you during the debate over the Godly Ways."</p>

  <p>To that, Zheng only nodded and smiled. "Of course they will."</p>

  <p>It wasn't the first time he had been targeted, after all. He was used to it.</p>

  <p>"I will protect you, Zheng," Yan said seriously. "Now that I am strong enough, you can follow me into the Killing Zone. If anyone dares to hurt you, I will kill them all."</p>

  <p>Her expression was stern and unmoving.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the serious expression on Yan's fair and gentle face, his heart ached for her. If he had a choice, he would rather let Yan live quietly in the fairy palace instead of fighting alongside him.</p>
