<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ever since Aleyna and Han Liusu had returned from the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, they'd both been quite worried about Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>What was more, Han Liusu had even tried to use her connections with the Jiang Clan in order to obtain a little information concerning the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Had this occurred in the past, the chances were she'd have succeeded.</p>

  <p>She did benefit from a high position in her clan, after all. It was easy for the Holy Emperor's eldest daughter to get information here and there from the Jiang Clan. This time, it was another story though. She gained nothing at all.</p>

  <p>Because of Harold and his group, the Jiang Clan had equally lost control of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>As a result, she had no choice but to give up. There was no way she could travel to the Evolutionary Universe personally. Her father would never agree or allow such to happen.</p>

  <p>Earlier though, upon hearing Kelsey provide news about Tianxing, she began to feel rather curious.</p>

  <p>As of the moment the Luo Clan had been exterminated, less and less talents with Luo as their family name existed. Thus, it was kind of strange that a talent surnamed Luo had suddenly appeared. Moreover, if Luo Zheng really did come to the divine land, there was no way he'd actually use his real name.</p>

  <p>On second thought though, the divine land really was very vast. Maybe Luo Zheng happened to arrive in the Han Clan's ancestral land and successfully passed the Heavenly Han House test. Maybe he happened to meet Kelsey in the Heavenly Han House, and Kelsey just happened to show off in front of Han Liusu. And perhaps, Luo Zheng really was that person, only using an alias.</p>

  <p>Was that even possible? The probability of such an occurrence was very slim, almost negligible. After figuring this out though, Han Liusu didn't pay much attention to it.</p>

  <p>As for the young girl named Kelsey, she went out on a whim and had a strong desire to win. In the past, she had searched high and low in the Holy Emperor City on several occasions for information about Tianxing, but to no avail. Ultimately, she gave up.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, today, she, Han Liusu and Aleyna had all come to observe the rewards distributed by their father there, and they had happened to encounter Tianxing.</p>

  <p>From her standpoint, Han Liusu looked Luo Zheng up and down secretly.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Zheng looked totally different now and even his Mu Ning had become stronger than in the past, Han Liusu still felt like she recognized him. This feeling confused her deeply, for it was the first time they had ever met.</p>

  <p>Why did he give her such a familiar feeling?</p>

  <p>"I didn't join the Holy Emperor City," Luo Zheng stated, shaking his head in negation. "I joined the Purple Soul Hall."</p>

  <p>"What?!" Kelsey exclaimed. "You joined the Purple Soul Hall?" The corners of Kelsey's mouth twitched slightly and a strange smile spread on her lips. "Why did you join the Purple Soul Hall instead? From what I've heard, even the very few men in the Purple Soul Hall have womanly ways."</p>

  <p>Aleyna, who was standing not far away from them, suddenly bounced toward them. She didn't look much older than Kelsey, and she showed just as much interest in the whole Tianxing thing as Kelsey did. "Kelsey, is this the talent surnamed Luo that you mentioned earlier? He doesn't have the Purple Power Body, right? How did he even join the Purple Soul Hall?"</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the two girls giggling away in front of him, Luo Zheng said helplessly, "It's not funny and this isn't a joke. Although I don't have the Purple Power Body, I was recognized by the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way."</p>

  <p>He reached out his hand and flicked his index finger. A bright ray of purple mist began to surround him instantly, and there was fine internal momentum within it.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu was watching this scene play out from a short distance away and her eyes opened wide with surprise. "The Purple Mu Ning Godly Way is all about feminine Mu Ning. Only those who have controlled the latter can actually master this technique with skill. You can't comprehend this thing at all, and yet you've specifically managed to comprehend the internal momentum contained in the Purple Mu Ning Godly Way. Tell us, how did you do that?" she asked coldly.</p>

  <p>Over the years, Han Liusu had, like many others, become more mature and melancholic, as well as more imposing as a princess. Her question to Luo Zheng was asked in a condescending tone, if only by force of habit.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry that I can't tell you," Luo Zheng promptly refused without a second's hesitation.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu said nothing in return, but the guard's face fell next to her, his expression emotionless. The guard was a top-rank True God. He was Liusu's body guard and also enjoyed a high status in the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>When he heard Zheng's answer, he shouted coldly, "How dare you refuse to answer the princess's question?"</p>

  <p>In spite of the fact that the guard before him was a top-rank True God and that he was in an aggressive mood, Luo Zheng calmly asked, "I may have joined the Han Clan's Floating Island, but that doesn't mean I'm a slave here, right?"</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng said was true, of course. In reality, the wealthy clans of the various Floating Islands didn't have much restrictions on their disciples and those with different surnames.</p>

  <p>However, in order to play the clans up, a large number of disciples with different surnames were usually quite courteous. In fact, they even fawned on their elders in hopes of making them happy and thus benefiting from certain opportunities.</p>

  <p>And yet, this was what Luo Zheng cared about the least.</p>

  <p>For him, the Han Clan's Floating Island was nothing more than a mere passageway. In order to enter the Everest Spirit Mountain, eight thousand points were needed and he would accumulate them little by little. Luo Zheng wanted to succeed on his own and refused to ask anyone else for help.</p>

  <p>As the top-rank True God listened to Luo Zheng speak, he only grew even more infuriated. "How dare you!" he roared.</p>

  <p>"That's enough, Grant," Han Liusu said while keeping her voice under control.</p>

  <p>And with Liusu's words, the top-rank True God now known as Grant shut his mouth. Before retreating off to the side, Grant gave Luo Zheng a ferocious stare, which was so intense that it was almost as though he had daggers in his eyes.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, as Han Liusu listened to Zheng's answers, the puzzled expression on her face gradually disappeared. The confusion in her heart though, couldn't help but grow bigger and stronger by the minute.</p>

  <p>In both appearance and tone of voice, the fellow standing before her truly was completely different from Luo Zheng. That said though, his character and personality were nearly the exact same. She might not be capable of seeing flaws, but her unique intuition was constantly guiding her - and usually, in the right direction.</p>

  <p>A little while ago, she had only felt somewhat strange because Zheng's Mu Ning made her feel familiar. Now though, she had already tried proving that Tianxing was Luo Zheng, and Luo Zheng was only pretending that he didn't know who they were.</p>

  <p>With that thought in mind, a cunning look appeared in her eyes. She turned to Aleyna and asked, "Aleyna, didn't Kelsey say that there existed a proving godly warrior that was even stronger than you?"</p>

  <p>Aleyna's talent was even greater than that of Han Liusu. Although she was only a proving godly warrior at the moment, she had already ranked second among the proving godly warriors in the Arena of Legends, next to Donovan from the Jiang Clan. Aleyna was nothing short of impressive.</p>

  <p>Since the Floating Islands represented the divine land's highest level, it could be said that Aleyna, who ranked second among the proving godly warriors in the divine land, had extraordinary talent.</p>

  <p>It was true that Kelsey had said that in the past, but she was reckless and less sensitive than Han Liusu. She had already forgotten what she had said, and Aleyna didn't see any special thing in Tianxing. In other words, she hadn't connected Luo Zheng and Tianxing together whatsoever.</p>

  <p>But as Han Liusu reminded her, she remembered immediately, clapping her hands together at once as the thought flashed in her mind. "Oh, yeah, that's right! Kelsey, didn't you brag about this guy's strength every day a while back? You said he was stronger than me, huh? Tianxing, why don't we compete, right here, right now? Come on, hurry up! Let's do it!"</p>

  <p>Aleyna was the type of person who always did whatever she pleased.</p>

  <p>And right now, her full intention was to compete with Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for her, had she known that Tianxing was Luo Zheng, she would have never made such a silly choice. Although she was somewhat reckless, she was also very clever. Once Han Liusu and she had come back, they took the time to secretly analyze Zheng's background, and even read up on a little history that was hard for regular warriors to get their hands on.</p>

  <p>The more they knew, the more astonished they became. It was at that point that they decided to keep this secret for themselves.</p>

  <p>Aleyna had already been slightly aware about Zheng's background and origin. Therefore, she knew very well that she was no match for him.</p>

  <p>Now though, she wasn't thinking too clearly. Just a few seconds ago, instigated by Han Liusu, she had offered to challenge Tianxing. At least, while they competed, Han Liusu would be capable of using the time to retrieve more information and clues on Tianxing.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at Han Liusu helplessly. As long as he had to deal with Han Liusu and Aleyna, nothing good would happen.</p>
