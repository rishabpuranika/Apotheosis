  <p>
</p>

  <p>After spiraling into the depth of madness, remaining calm after future setbacks of any kind, would be impossible for anyone to do.</p>

  <p>Difficulties would bedevil the person, and he would bring more harm to his mind and soul by worrying.</p>

  <p>Under the circumstances though, the individual needed to help himself, without others interfering or removing the problems.</p>

  <p>Hall Chief Ouyang was standing back away from the competition field, scowling. He watched as his greatest source of pride, and chief disciple, Vale, was beaten, and deteriorated, succumbing to insanity, by Luo Zheng's hand in front of everyone.</p>

  <p>However, he knew the only solution in this situation was to leave the afflicted person alone, since confronting someone in the grips of madness would result in sending the struggling victim into the abyss.</p>

  <p>When a woman became angered, she could regain and maintain control, unless a well-meaning individual tried to comfort her, then the tenuous balance would tilt, and she would end up in tears.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Luo Luo Zheng approached the white lotus slowly. No longer filled with life vitality, the lotus was draining quickly, but, Vale didn't have time to care about the white lotus.</p>

  <p>All the while, step by step, Luo Luo Zheng drew closer, until he stood over the white lotus, looking down at Vale.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a chance to follow my steps! In three years, you can battle me! But, even then, you won't be able to beat me. Then again, if you aren't courageous enough to try, you may as well leave with your shame and die. Although your talent is outstanding, you lack determination to excel in martial arts. Look at you, a minor frustration and you fall apart, becoming impossible to calm. Even if you didn't meet your match yet, it wouldn't be long before you did...</p>

  <p>This is a large world. In the Eastern Region alone, there are billions of people, add to that, there are ten times as many in the Central Region, or so I hear. Out there, genius disciples refine the cultivation skills above tier four from childhood and use all kinds of panaceas to improve. Their talents are inherited from their parents, and they have profoundly strong mentors to guide them. And just maybe, one of those geniuses can defeat you, even one as young as nine or ten. Heck, they can clobber me even now. Your pride is twisted! It's ludicrous! It's arrogance...</p>

  <p>Only when you understand that your pride is deceptive, can you transcend it and begin to cultivate in earnest. At that point, you may have a chance to catch up to my level. If you don't though, you will be nothing but a loser your whole life. No. In fact, if you don't, it will prove that you were always a loser!"</p>

  <p>Each word Luo Luo Zheng said, cut into Vale's head, and felt like a knife stabbing over and over into his heart.</p>

  <p>The more Chief Ouyang listened to Luo Luo Zheng, the more irate he became, until he wasn't able to stand anymore and suddenly exploded, "Luo Luo Zheng! You already won against Vale. Don't take things too far!"</p>

  <p>Actually, Luo Luo Zheng had already crossed the line, and instead of being critical, Luo Luo Zheng had insulted Vale beyond reason. Vale teetered on the edge of spiraling into madness, and Luo Luo Zheng didn't show signs of letting up.</p>

  <p>Before the match most people preferred Vale over Luo Luo Zheng, but watching him beat Vale, their feelings changed, and even now, many people were on Luo Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>After all, most of the opinions were based on the fact that Luo Luo Zheng came from a poor family, and was at a lower refinement level. Since Vale hailed from one of the noble clans and was a personal disciple under Hall Chief Ouyang, it was assumed that Vale was more powerful indeed. Add to that, Vale had attempted to have a relationship with Luo Zheng's sister, Yan. All these things made Luo Luo Zheng the choice of the people.</p>

  <p>However, after Luo Zheng's outburst, that was quickly changing.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's critical tirade went farther than merely adding insult to injury. It was clear that Luo Zheng's hate-filled speech was intended to give Vale a final shove into the fire.</p>

  <p>As he stood in the vanishing lotus, Luo Luo Zheng ignored Ouyang, looking down at Vale, and Luo Zheng's gaze was reminiscent of a spring breeze. He carefully kept his face devoid of any other emotion because it was quite clear that if he smiled, even faintly, everyone present would just think he was taunting Vale more.</p>

  <p>A collective sigh went up from the crowd. Most onlookers thought Vale was done, and the days of having the pleasure of watching a talented disciple favored by thousands of people were gone, and his future appearance would just be that of one more idiot of the Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>Just then, a virtual lotus shadow appeared under Vale's feet. The empty, sad expression was replaced by an intangible countenance. There was an otherworldly air about Vale as he seemed to gaze at everybody, and no one at the same time right before his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>Time felt like it stood still while the virtual lotus shadow grew, spreading under his feet.</p>

  <p>And then there was another holy, pure white lotus giving off a delicate fragrance which sprang up fast, and in a split second the blossom swallowed Vale, enveloping him.</p>

  <p>"That's..." Ouyang was shocked, and he stopped talking, inhaling sharply in amazement.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Kenneth jumped up from his seat. He had known Luo Luo Zheng would probably defeat Vale, but this turn of events was not something he could foresee. For a long moment, Kenneth stood silent with his mouth agape, and then Kenneth chuckled as he shook his head, and said, "I didn't think it was possible for me to underestimate Luo Luo Zheng still! He knew Vale was on the edge of spiraling into madness and yet he knew if he incited Vale's ire, instead of him plunging into the abyss, Vale would embrace his devotion to martial arts. This is great! Just look, Vale has had an epiphany!"</p>

  <p>Epiphany...</p>

  <p>After the initial shock of seeing the white lotus materialize worn off, Elder Xu's blank gaze changed into one of admiration.</p>

  <p>An epiphany was an opportunity that was rare and so significant that every warrior hoped for one, but, most of them, including Elder Xu, lived a lifetime and never experienced the epiphany. Realizing an epiphany was even more difficult for those talented, more powerful, and more advanced in martial arts training. After all, when the warriors were unenlightened in the ways of martial arts, that was when they were more open for a sudden epiphany. However, if a warrior gleaned a great extent of martial arts, it was more difficult to reach an epiphany.</p>

  <p>Since Vale was in the Illuminating Soul Realm now, maybe his epiphany would greatly enhance his strength.</p>

  <p>Who would have believed that Luo Zheng's observations would inspire Vale to such heights!</p>

  <p>Throughout the calamity, Luo Zheng's serene deportment never changed which made people think he knew from the start what would happen.</p>

  <p>"Considering Vale is already one of the top personal disciples, refining at the peak of grade-one Illuminating Soul Realm, if he has the epiphany now, none of the personal disciples will be his equal in battle!"</p>

  <p>"It's undeniable that Vale's strength will increase greatly due to his epiphany, especially since only one of significance can instantly break through like that. But, it's better not to announce a personal disciple can't be beaten. The realm that the warriors have reached is important for them to compete, but Luo Luo Zheng made headway against the common sense, and he's only in grade two of the nature level!"</p>

  <p>"Exactly, also consider that Tianming hasn't drawn a sword yet. Who knows how terrifying he will be after he does?! Well then, maybe Tianming could defeat the personal disciple with the strength of consummation!"</p>

  <p>With Vale cocooned in the epiphany, the match was paused. About five minutes went by when suddenly a cracking sound drew attention to the white lotus encasing Vale. The sound grew louder while a fine line expanded, spreading, and splitting until the entire lotus was filled with fissures.</p>

  <p>Finally, an ear piercing explosion startled everyone as the white lotus shattered, and there, in the center was Vale sitting. He opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>There was a new attitude about Vale, along with a fresh-faced, spry look in his eyes. His character seemed different, and the arrogance that was hidden in his drive earlier was gone now, replaced by a gentle, regal temperament.</p>

  <p>"I always believed that my success would come during the All Peaks Competition, and it would be a simple matter of taking it. Easy, I thought! And that I would finish you in the first round of our match, even easier, but I just lost. I was beaten so horribly that I could hardly bear it. At first, I couldn't even understand how you defeated me, but, now I do!"</p>

  <p>As large as the world was, even a capable genius should have appreciation, not like a person of narrow view.</p>

  <p>It wasn't horrible when he was like a frog sitting in a well and had narrow view. However, it was terrible when his views were radically changed, and he couldn't stand the stimulation outside. Thus, he went spiraling toward madness.</p>

  <p>Vale's instant epiphany broadened his mind and even gave him some insight into the spirit of the Lotus Scriptures.</p>

  <p>Ouyang had told Vale at one time that the Lotus Scriptures was a tier 4 cultivation method, but its true power went far beyond the ordinary four tiers, and couldn't be placed in the same category with them.</p>

  <p>Because the Lotus Scriptures was passed down from a mighty clan in Central Region, Vale needed to study it, to master the spirit and give full play to its power.</p>

  <p>Although Vale comprehended a little about the spirit, he still needed some time to master all of it.</p>

  <p>"Thanks!" said Vale humbly as he bowed to Luo Luo Zheng before walking off the competition field. He walked up to Ouyang, bowing deeply, and he said,</p>

  <p>"Master, I have become inspired and want to remain in seclusion to cultivate. Therefore, I won't be able to participate in the rest of the All Peaks Competition's matches."</p>

  <p>"Oh...?" Ouyang was at a loss for words. After all, he took the All Peaks Competition seriously. If Vale could just finish as one of the top three in the competition, Ouyang would be a very proud master. Moreover, the top three would have the chance to go to the Cloud Road, which would be helpful to Vale.</p>

  <p>Seeing Vale's expression though, touched Ouyang's heart. Perhaps during the epiphany, Vale had comprehended something very important, and it must be the best course of action for him to stay secluded and master what he had learned. It wasn't the end of the world, after all, Cloud Road would still be there in three years. On the other hand, the epiphany was a great chance that most people never got....</p>

  <p>So, Ouyang nodded and said, "Okay Vale, I will permit you to remain in seclusion."</p>

  <p>The battle between Luo Luo Zheng and Vale was extremely exciting. Who would have thought that Vale would reveal an ancient fairy weapon when he had the advantage over Luo Luo Zheng, or that Luo Luo Zheng would turn the tables somehow.</p>

  <p>Even now, no one knew how Luo Luo Zheng had beat Vale's sword with vibration force.</p>

  <p>Keeping everyone on the edge of their seats was how Vale teetered on the edge of the abyss after the battle, and wasn't able to control himself.</p>

  <p>Bringing the match to a riveting climax was Luo Luo Zheng, as he provoked and verbally assaulted Vale which somehow brought on an epiphany....</p>
