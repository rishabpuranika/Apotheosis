  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once David saw Luo Zheng retreat quickly, he could no longer hide the big smile on his face.</p>

  <p>The more powerful his opponent was, the more excited he got.</p>

  <p>The moment he knew that Luo Zheng was able to comprehend the Truth of Divine Dao, he knew he would have fun defeating him.</p>

  <p>For him, he only truly felt a sense of achievement when overcoming real challenges. In his eyes, Lisa, Jerome, Elsa, and Romeo were not worthy of his time and effort.</p>

  <p>"Hoo!"</p>

  <p>After the two sharp knives in his hands collided with each other, the two light balls merged into one.</p>

  <p>The two sharp knives looked very similar to the black sword that Lisa used, but they were totally different.</p>

  <p>Since David's master was an expert at refining weapons, he forged these wild weapons just for him. Moreover, the two wild weapons were modelled after the famous Dual Stream Saber of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Both of the wild weapons were able to open up the void.</p>

  <p>He could activate it whenever he made use of the Truth of Void Destruction.</p>

  <p>When David and Luo Zheng launched their ferocious attacks against each other, their formidable powers didn't dissipate at all. They were instead kept inside the void by the two sharp knives.</p>

  <p>But not long after, the powers were then released by David!</p>

  <p>The surging power mixed with the Truth of Void Destruction formed a ball of energy that contained an extremely unstable wave of energy. Its strength was very devastating.</p>

  <p>Even David had to be careful as he tried to control it!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The blazing energy ball flew straight towards Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Will you still be able to resist it this time?"</p>

  <p>In David's opinion, even if Luo Zheng displayed the Truth of Cultivation Nature, he merely mixed it with his body movements and was still unable to bring out its full potential.</p>

  <p>But what David didn't know was that when it came to the Wild God, Luo Zheng was not as powerful as he was. After all, Luo Zheng was only able to practice the Wild God system for a short period of time. Although the Nine Li race trained him thoroughly, his foundations were still somewhat unstable.</p>

  <p>But in terms of cultivating the True God system, David's understanding was clearly inferior to Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Zheng had several methods he could use to break David's move.</p>

  <p>For example, he could directly use the strength source to detonate the extremely unstable energy ball before it reached him.</p>

  <p>However, when the energy ball was coming for Luo Zheng, an interesting idea occurred to him. As he quickly retreated, the light of the Godly Tile in his inner world flashed brightly.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the grid of the Godly Tile engraved with the characters "Parting Water Divine Dao" emitted a strong amount of internal momentum from the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"Parting Water Divine Mirror!"</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng waved his hand, streams of immense internal momentum from the Parting Water Divine Dao rapidly gathered in his hand and turned into a light blue mirror.</p>

  <p>The mirror then stayed right in front of him to shield him from the attack.</p>

  <p>Seeing the mirror in front of Luo Zheng, David couldn't move for a second. He had a sinister grin written all over his face.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what Luo Zheng wanted to do at first but he thought it was childish and ridiculous of him to use a mirror to block his attack.</p>

  <p>People always ended up being hurt or killed if they acted too childish and silly. Many talents from the Nine Li race were defeated by David because of their naivety and stupid methods. It seemed to be too easy for him to kill them because of that.</p>

  <p>As he thought about it, David watched his energy ball reach the mirror.</p>

  <p>At that moment, everyone from the Nine Li race got extremely nervous.</p>

  <p>Elsa clenched her fists so hard that she almost pierced her palms with her sharp nails.</p>

  <p>They weren't aware of Luo Zheng's methods either.</p>

  <p>Although they all believed in Luo Zheng's strength and had faith that he had a reason for shielding himself with a mirror, they still couldn't help but worry the moment they saw it with their own eyes.</p>

  <p>Even Adele was getting upset as she watched.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>David shouted as the energy ball was about to hit.</p>

  <p>However, things didn't go as he expected.</p>

  <p>The energy ball bounced back towards David after gently touching the Parting Water Divine Mirror!</p>

  <p>The energy ball was moving much faster after it bounced back.</p>

  <p>'How is that possible?'</p>

  <p>David looked at the energy ball in disbelief.</p>

  <p>The energy ball got close to him in the blink of an eye. There was nothing David could do about it. He gritted his teeth as his huge body flashed. He tried to hide in the void as fast as he could.</p>

  <p>"Break!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

  <p>An invisible force was shot behind the energy ball.</p>

  <p>The energy ball was unstable since the beginning, so it wasn't surprising when it exploded the moment Luo Zheng used his strength source to detonate it.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>A surge of violent energy began to frantically spread around.</p>

  <p>At the same moment the energy ball exploded, the Truth of Void Destruction within it also continued to tear its surrounding space apart.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was surprised to see the immense power of the energy ball.</p>

  <p>The method of David was very rough but it was also very powerful.</p>

  <p>The Space Law was very powerful in the universe while the Space Divine Dao was one of the most powerful Divine Dao to ever exist in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Truth of Void Destruction was considered to be one of the most powerful among all kinds of Truths of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, even David himself was not able to fully control the energy ball.</p>

  <p>After a short while, a figure staggered and fell out of the void that was not far away from Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The figure was none other than David.</p>

  <p>When the energy ball exploded, it tore its surrounding space apart. Even if David was able to hide inside the void, he wasn't completely safe from its impact.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the golden light around David's body was much dimmer than before and his clothes were also visibly torn apart.</p>

  <p>David's Yellow Emperor Wild Body was far stronger than any other ordinary race member. If Jerome or Lisa was attacked like that, they would have been severely injured if not completely torn into pieces.</p>

  <p>The people of the Yellow Emperor race were all speechless.</p>

  <p>Everyone had a grim look on their faces.</p>

  <p>Lancelot was also silent and was still in shock.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of Lancelot and the other elders of the Yellow Emperor race, they were still capable of winning even when everyone else had lost.</p>

  <p>It was because they had faith that David could defeat anyone who dared to face him.</p>

  <p>He had already surpassed the level of the Wild God. He was getting closer to the exiles and had almost reached the Other Shore Realm.</p>

  <p>But as he battled Luo Zheng from an unknown background, David was at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>"What is that strange method..." David asked Luo Zheng as his teeth was gritting in anxiety.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng then withdrew his hand slightly as the internal momentum from the Parting Water Divine Dao dissipated. The bright mirror had been broken and disappeared completely.</p>

  <p>"It was just some silly trick," Luo Zheng answered lightly.</p>

  <p>David's eyes were beaming with hate. "Of course it was some silly trick!</p>

  <p>If you think you can beat me with it, you are more ignorant than I thought! You must be dreaming!"</p>

  <p>With that, he stretched out his arms and his huge body once again flew through the void as he headed straight towards Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>In addition to the Truth of Divine Dao, David had another trump card up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>In their world, the soul of the Wild Gods was regarded to be quite weak.</p>

  <p>But there were always some Wild Gods who had more powerful souls and David was definitely one of them.</p>

  <p>Several exiles had put great effort into helping him improve further. As a result, his soul was far stronger than an ordinary Wild God.</p>

  <p>At that moment, David rushed towards Luo Zheng without any hesitation and with a light golden ring on the head of the soul in the depths of his mind.</p>

  <p>And at that same moment, the surface of the ring flashed as a strong soul force leaked out of his mind and headed straight for Luo Zheng!</p>
