<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3718 Nine-Imprint Holy Soul </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Inside the quiet confines of the soul cloud was Zheng, who was still quite confused.</p>

  <p>It wasn't only him, however. Even the Primeval Lord of Heaven was baffled as well.</p>

  <p>The truth was that he had indeed planned to help Zheng pass through the Soul City.</p>

  <p>Not only that, but he also wanted to help Zheng obtain nine Holy Soul Imprints.</p>

  <p>Even though more than a thousand chaotic eras had passed, he still clearly remembered when he had obtained the seven Holy Soul Imprints, he had faintly seen that there seemed to be something else on top of the light column.</p>

  <p>He didn't know what that was, but he guessed that it might have something to do with the Instant Civilization from the beginning.</p>

  <p>Everything about the Instant Civilization greatly piqued his interest.</p>

  <p>However, it was extremely difficult to obtain nine Holy Soul Imprints.</p>

  <p>Despite so many chaotic eras that had passed, the highest record was still eight Holy Soul Imprints.</p>

  <p>He thought that it was the first time that Zheng had entered the soul cloud, so it would be better if he could take some time to adapt to the whole thing.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he planned to teach Zheng about his experience after the latter returned from the soul cloud.</p>

  <p>Yet, Zheng had remained motionless after he entered the soul cloud. That was why the Primeval Lord of Heaven was so confused. "Zheng, what's wrong with you?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked.</p>

  <p>"These things from the soul cloud don't seem to affect me at all, and it looks like I can't drive the soul pillar up either," said Zheng.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven's eyes slightly widened at Zheng's words. "It's impossible?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>In general, one had to repeatedly replace the Soul of Light to achieve the Colorless Soul.</p>

  <p>The "colorless" indicated the world of materials. A person's soul was born with seven emotions and six desires. Those seven emotions and six desires were constantly replaced when the "faces" in the soul cloud devoured one's soul.</p>

  <p>For instance, Zheng would constantly forget something but also obtain something during the whole process.</p>

  <p>Only after he had forgotten everything could his Soul of Light be reborn and become a real Colorless Soul. By then, his Soul of Light would be in the Holy Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>At that point, the Soul of Light that turned into a Colorless Soul would've undergone some drastic changes.</p>

  <p>The soul cloud looked like a chaotic mass to ordinary people, but in reality, it could be divided into different layers, and each layer could replace the Soul of Light to a different extent.</p>

  <p>That was why no matter how weak Zheng's talent was, such a situation could never happen. "Is it possible that you have repelled the Colorless Soul?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>If so, then Zheng might not be able to pass through the Soul City, and let alone become an Eternal Warrior.</p>

  <p>"Repel..."</p>

  <p>Zheng reached out towards those "faces," and they kept biting him like mad.</p>

  <p>The rhythmic song echoed throughout the soul cloud.</p>

  <p>He still couldn't understand what it meant, but he suddenly felt a strange sensation surge deep in his soul.</p>

  <p>"What? They?want to bestow me?" he said out of the blue. He saw the cloud as a whole, but those "faces" inside the soul cloud were separate individuals.</p>

  <p>Still, the feeling he had in his soul was accurate.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As the faces continued to bite, the purple light inside Zheng's Soul of Light began to quickly peel off. It was as if his soul was divided and eaten, then a completely transparent soul had replaced it.</p>

  <p>When the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw what happened, he couldn't help but be stunned. "What? The replacement is all done?"</p>

  <p>The entire soul cloud raged like a storm. Even the people below like Toby, Libby, and Dailey all clearly saw that the faces had gathered in one place, then finally assembled at the soul pillar where Zheng sat.</p>

  <p>There were many other Souls of Light that entered the soul cloud at the same time as Zheng. Those Souls of Light all rose at varying rates, but when those "faces" rushed towards Zheng, there was no face that helped them replace their souls. Their soul pillars also stopped rising. They were all shocked and didn't know what was going on.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"Why did all those faces gather at Zheng's spot?"</p>

  <p>"I've never heard of this situation before?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Dailey just observed everything with vigilance.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the twenty-ninth stage of the Other Shore Realm was the starting point of another level. To put it simply, the powerful warriors who were on this level now would probably compete with each other in the future.</p>

  <p>Of course, Dailey refused to watch such an abnormal scene.</p>

  <p>"It seems a little different," Feng Ge said with a smile. Although she didn't know what had happened either, she had great confidence in Zheng.</p>

  <p>Those faces gathered for quite a while before they immediately dispersed.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng's Soul of Light became completely transparent. "What happened?" Zheng asked in surprise.</p>

  <p>He looked at his own hands in confusion. He was really afraid that he would disappear!</p>

  <p>"You've now achieved the Colorless Soul," the Primeval Lord of Heaven stated. "Don't I have to go up?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"It seems that is unnecessary now. Those faces came down at their own will. Ha-ha!" In reality, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was secretly quite surprised. Those faces that were raised inside the soul cloud devoured seven emotions and six desires as usual, but no one had ever had the same experience as Zheng.</p>

  <p>"But if I achieve the Colorless Soul in this way, I won't be able to obtain any Holy Soul Imprint, right?" Zheng asked again. The Primeval Lord of Heaven was startled when Zheng mentioned the Holy Soul Imprint.</p>

  <p>After one had attained the Colorless Soul, they only had one chance to obtain the Holy Soul Imprints.</p>

  <p>That chance was certainly not easy to miss. Now, the Primeval Lord of Heaven never expected that Zheng had entered the Holy Soul Realm in this way. He was so confused and his mind was a mess.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, however, he decided, "Don't leave the soul cloud. Go upward!"</p>

  <p>But even Zheng himself wasn't sure if he could drive the soul pillar. At the very least, the soul pillar didn't react when he tried to drive it just now.</p>

  <p>As soon as he heard what the Primeval Lord of Heaven said, he thought for a moment and pulled the soul pillar upward once again.</p>

  <p>This time, the soul pillar finally moved.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>From the crowd's point of view, those "faces" suddenly swarmed towards Zheng and abruptly left in flocks. They were completely confused.</p>

  <p>Just then, the soul pillar began to rise rapidly.</p>

  <p>One hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Three hundred feet...</p>

  <p>Nine hundred feet...</p>

  <p>One thousand feet...</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>As the light column on top of the soul cloud rose, Zheng's figure also appeared.</p>

  <p>At that moment, he was still climbing up with the soul pillar under his feet.</p>

  <p>Once he had crossed a distance of one thousand and eighty feet, a golden Holy Soul Imprint was already engraved on his chest.</p>

  <p>As soon as the golden imprint appeared, however, Zheng still continued to climb upwards.</p>

  <p>When he had crossed one thousand one hundred and sixty feet, he received the second Holy Soul Imprint.</p>

  <p>One thousand two hundred and forty feet...</p>

  <p>One thousand...</p>

  <p>The Holy Soul Imprints imprinted themselves on his body one after another.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Feng Ge watched him from under the soul cloud with her hand over her mouth. She was speechless.</p>

  <p>Aside from Feng Ge, all the others were similarly astonished and surprised as well.</p>

  <p>Dailey, in particular, trembled every time a Holy Soul Imprint appeared on the surface of Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>To obtain only one Holy Soul Imprint was considered the easiest, but only Dailey knew how much he had suffered just to get that one coveted Holy Soul Imprint.</p>
