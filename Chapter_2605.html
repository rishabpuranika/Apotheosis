  <p>
</p>

  <p>For all the exiles, the worst fate was to be trapped here forever.</p>

  <p>Time was cheap and they didn't mind using it just for a chance.</p>

  <p>Even if it was just a made-up story, they would still try to verify it because that was much better than doing nothing in the bone tower!</p>

  <p>Moreover, it was impossible that Timotheus especially brought Zheng to deceive her.</p>

  <p>It made Zheng secretly heave a sigh of relief when he heard the woman's decision.</p>

  <p>It was easier to persuade these exiles than he thought.</p>

  <p>But Zheng could understand. If he was trapped here for years, he wouldn't miss any opportunity to possibly get out.</p>

  <p>"That's great." Zheng smiled.</p>

  <p>The woman calmly stared at Zheng and said, "In fact, many years ago, I already knew that the prison built by the Chaos Ancient God is absolutely perfect and there exists no loopholes. Any efforts to escape are useless and the only way to possibly leave this world is in the hands of the Warden race. However, they won't say anything."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her slender shoulders and helplessly smiled.</p>

  <p>The Warden race were like ghosts who would quietly pass by. No one could get anything useful when they tried to communicate with them.</p>

  <p>The woman had once set up an array to bewitch them, tried to tempt them with special offers, or even seduced them, but it was all in vain.</p>

  <p>After all kinds of attempts, the Snake Goddess race could only give up.</p>

  <p>But Zheng said that there was a conflict within the Warden race and that he even found two Warden members!</p>

  <p>This made her realize that this opportunity was unique, therefore, important.</p>

  <p>No wonder Timotheus made Zheng so important and personally took him to her place.</p>

  <p>After she paused to think, the woman asked, "Are the two from the Warden race you mentioned safe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, they should be safe."</p>

  <p>"They can't enter a bone tower. Once the Light of Adjudication arrives, they'll definitely die. We must move faster." The woman's frown deepened.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the Light of Adjudication which happened only once for a thousand years, they would have still had a lot of time to make plans.</p>

  <p>A lot of things happened only by chance and it only depended on luck whether they could grasp the opportunity before it flashed away.</p>

  <p>"The less people who know about this, the better. I hope that top races like the Snake Goddess race, the Mysterious Oni race, the Star Deer race could join, but- not the Yellow Emperor race!" Timotheus suddenly spoke up, his voice grave.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor race and the Nine Li race had always been at odds with each other.</p>

  <p>It was a battle deeply ingrained in their bones, so Timotheus was naturally unwilling to help them.</p>

  <p>The woman smiled. "It's up to you. I don't care."</p>

  <p>For all the fights between the Yellow Emperor race and the Nine Li race, the Snake Goddess race had always been neutral.</p>

  <p>Later, the news was spread out by the Snake Goddess race and secretly traveled in the world at the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>If it was Timotheus who took Zheng to persuade the large races, the effect wouldn't be as strong.</p>

  <p>But it came from the woman, so the exiles from various races responded immediately without hesitation.</p>

  <p>A month later...</p>

  <p>At the edge of the Immemorial Wilderness...</p>

  <p>Several warriors lowered their heads and searched the bones on the ground, hoping to find one or two wild bones among them.</p>

  <p>Even though the wild bones in this part of the Immemorial Wilderness were almost all excavated, there were at least one or two that were still left.</p>

  <p>At that moment, space fluctuations continuously spread throughout the sky.</p>

  <p>From the fluctuations, some figures walked out and silently stood in the air.</p>

  <p>These people were exiles from different bloodline races.</p>

  <p>Jaws dropped to the ground as the warriors who were searching for wild bones looked up at the sky.</p>

  <p>In their eyes, the most powerful beings were Wild Gods who could turn into giants thousands of feet high. They didn't know that there were people in this world who could travel through the void and could freely come and go.</p>

  <p>In the nearby Iron Tribe...</p>

  <p>Zelda made a mark on a bone card and calculated how long Zheng had been gone.</p>

  <p>It had been almost a year since Zheng left and nobody knew what happened with him.</p>

  <p>Due to the wild bones Zheng left behind, Zelda improved a lot and could establish herself in the Iron Tribe.</p>

  <p>It didn't stop the worries in her heart because if Zheng failed to take her and Luther to a bone tower in two years, they would completely disappear from this world.</p>

  <p>'It's difficult for ordinary person to join an ordinary sect but Zheng... He won't let us down, ' she thought while staring at Luther who was silently cultivating through mediation.</p>

  <p>Zelda suddenly felt an intense aura descending.</p>

  <p>It felt like it was being emitted by dozens of powerful creatures.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Zelda was startled and didn't know what happened. Even Luther's eyes snapped and stared at her sister in shock.</p>

  <p>"Luther, stay here. I'll go out to have a look!"</p>

  <p>She rushed out of the thatched hut right after she finished speaking.</p>

  <p>How could Luther let his sister go alone? He had never experienced such an imposing aura which his sister wouldn't be able to resist. He followed her out immediately.</p>

  <p>The members of the Iron Tribe panicked as well.</p>

  <p>The tribe were rarely attacked by surrounding forces, let alone powerful sects. However, even a small force in the city could bring them disaster.</p>

  <p>The lives of these desolate people were as light as feathers.</p>

  <p>"They're..."</p>

  <p>Even Zelda couldn't stop from gaping when she saw the group of people in the sky.</p>

  <p>They emitted a strong pressure even when they were just standing still but she couldn't tell their cultivation level. It could only mean that their cultivation level was beyond her comprehension.</p>

  <p>Luther came close to whisper, "Zelda... who are they?"</p>

  <p>"Why did you come out?" Zelda scolded her brother but kept her eyes firmly at the sky.</p>

  <p>Luther smile bitterly. "Will I be safe if I hide in the hut?"</p>

  <p>He was less worried than his sister because if it was meant to happen, then it would.</p>

  <p>Another space fluctuation came as they were staring at the sky and Zheng quietly emerged from it.</p>

  <p>The fists at her sides tightly clenched and her jaw dropped when Zelda recognized that it was Zheng.</p>

  <p>Only one thought came in her mind, Zheng succeeded even faster than she expected!</p>

  <p>In the air...</p>

  <p>The woman of the Snake Goddess race flatly asked, "Who are the two you talked about?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze swept over the place, and he found Luther and Zelda who stood at the entrance to the tribe.</p>

  <p>His body flashed and he arrived in front of Zelda in an instant. "We're ready!"</p>
