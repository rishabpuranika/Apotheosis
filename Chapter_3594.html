<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Elephant Men who were a bit far away from the Moon Fire Slaves were shocked by what they saw.</p>

  <p>The scorching hot aura had spread towards them, forcing them to retreat.</p>

  <p>"Chieftain..."</p>

  <p>"High priest..." the Elephant Men murmured as they retreated.</p>

  <p>They didn't understand why these things that had come down would kill the high priest.</p>

  <p>Didn't they appear because they felt their piety? But why would they kill the devout believers?</p>

  <p>"No. 12, what should we do with these Elephant Men?" asked one of the Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves didn't have their own names.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was not only them, but most of the members of the Element Spirit race that didn't have names.</p>

  <p>A name was a noble symbol in the Element Spirit race. It represented a distinct individual and ordinary creatures were not qualified to have one.</p>

  <p>The names of the Moon Fire Slaves were a series of numbers. The closer the numbers were to number one, the stronger they were.</p>

  <p>The names of the three were No. 12, No. 13 and No. 14. They were incredibly powerful among the Moon Fire Slaves and No. 12 was the strongest among them. Naturally, he was the leader of the three.</p>

  <p>"They are useless. Get rid of them," No. 12 replied indifferently.</p>

  <p>No. 13 took a slow step forward and lightly pressed his foot to the ground.</p>

  <p>As he did, a ball of green flame spread from beneath his foot throughout the entire village.</p>

  <p>Some Elephant Men realized something was terribly wrong and rushed to escape the village.</p>

  <p>Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong...</p>

  <p>A chaotic rumble of footsteps sounded from the tribe as they rushed out, but no matter how fast they were, escaping the spreading green flames was impossible.</p>

  <p>The village continued to burn and the sprinting Elephant Men were turned to huge balls of fire. The low buildings, grass, totems, everything the tribe owned, were ignited and engulfed in dark green flames.</p>

  <p>As the Elephant Men were burned, three small balls appeared above the heads of the three Moon Fire Slaves and moved into their bodies, quickly suppressing their amazing strength. This suppressive force came from Stage Seventeen, and it was almost impossible to resist.</p>

  <p>The strength being pushed down was followed by great pain. They struggled but eventually managed to adapt to it.</p>

  <p>"I heard those two are purified beings. Their strength can't be underestimated," said No. 14 worriedly.</p>

  <p>When one's strength was suppressed, their confidence often went with it.</p>

  <p>"If they are really purified beings capable of crossing the stages of the Other Shore, that would be troublesome to deal with," No. 13 agreed.</p>

  <p>"Before, that was true, but now it may not be that difficult," No. 12 replied menacingly.</p>

  <p>No. 13 and No. 14 remained silent.</p>

  <p>The suppressive force of the Other Shore was impossible to overcome. This was a known fact set in stone.</p>

  <p>Until now. The Element Spirit race had found a way to avoid it, and all it would cost was their lives.</p>

  <p>No. 12 might have only been a little stronger than the other two, but he was the leader here. If someone needed to be sacrificed to remove the suppression, it would have to be either No. 13 or No.14.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. Hopefully we'll be a step ahead of them and reach the dangerous region first," No. 12 ordered, not caring what the others thought. All he needed was to complete the task assigned by the Element Spirits.</p>

  <p>A gust of wind swept by, causing the several hundred feet high grass of the grassland to bend and sway like a field of rolling green waves.</p>

  <p>Zheng and Elvinia were still moving through the north of the grassland, unaware of what had happened to the tribe of the Elephant Men.</p>

  <p>If this grassland were not so huge and vast, Zheng would have sped through terrifyingly quick. But here, the lightning he had turned into was but a tiny needle...</p>

  <p>"Buzz, buzz, buzz..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, behind Zheng, buzzing sounds could be heard. A few giant bees the size of houses flapped their translucent wings as they swiftly chased after Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Three more bees have come..."</p>

  <p>Zheng narrowed his eyes and warned Elvinia, "Get ready!"</p>

  <p>He then threw Elvinia high into the air. As she flew, his body began expanding and became ten thousand feet high in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Swoosh...</p>

  <p>Now a giant, Zheng swung his palms and slapped down hard, smashing the three giant bees into pieces.</p>

  <p>The moment they were crushed, Zheng turned and shrunk down to his regular size, catching Elvinia as she fell back down and continued on his way forward.</p>

  <p>It was hard to tell how many times they had come across these giant bees on their way. Although they were both capable of killing the bees, capturing and killing them would take a lot more effort than if Zheng transformed into a Wild God.</p>

  <p>After only two encounters, Zheng had devised this simplest plan to deal with them— slap them to death the way he would kill a fly.</p>

  <p>A few rounds of this and Zheng was already very skilled at it, effortlessly sending them to a quick death.</p>

  <p>Half a day later, giant wood fences appeared before them. These fences marked the edge of the grassland.</p>

  <p>"We have arrived at the edge of the grassland," said Elvinia.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in acknowledgment and made his way through the fences.</p>

  <p>It seemed that only the grassland in the south of Stage Seventeen was filled with giant creatures. Everything went back to normal once they crossed to other side of the fences.</p>

  <p>However, there was a cyan gray gobi adjacent to the grassland, and farther away from the gobi was a vast desert.</p>

  <p>According to the map, once they crossed the grassland they should walk along the gobi.</p>

  <p>After confirming their direction, Zheng and Elvinia continued on, following the map.</p>

  <p>They had only gone a short distance, when in the corner of the gobi, the heads of several mice stuck out of many little caves.</p>

  <p>"Squeak! There are outsiders coming this way again!"</p>

  <p>"Their objective seems clear, they should be heading for the dangerous place!"</p>

  <p>"If they wish to die, there is no need to stop them. They can't even survive meeting the lamps. They will die for sure. Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

  <p>"Squeak! No one has visited the dangerous place for many years. We'd better be careful. We have to inform the others..."</p>

  <p>The mice quickly ducked back into their caves.</p>

  <p>After walking down more than two hundred miles, Zheng and Elvinia finally caught sight of the end of the gobi. They could now see the desert and the grassland intertwined in the distance, the two areas forming a circle.</p>

  <p>"Here it is..."</p>

  <p>Zheng opened his palm, stared at the map presented by the Other Shore Key, and said, "This circle should be the bottom part of the gourd-shaped area!"</p>

  <p>Finally finding the destination marked by the Other Shore Key had Zheng brimming with excitement. After observing and taking it all in for a moment, he and Elvinia then flew towards the desert.</p>
