  <p>
</p>

  <p>It only took less than thirty seconds before over a thousand golden armored guards had been killed.</p>

  <p>At that point, there were only two to three hundred people left on the steps of the Supreme Dragon Hall. Most of them were the children of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Moreover, there were also a few maids among them.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan had been controlling the Three-Element Sword Array for quite some time now. Undoubtedly, this had her feeling extremely exhausted. No matter how desperate it might seem, she had no choice but to keep on fighting.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu's divine flames burned brightly upon her face. Slowly, she rose in the air and prepared for an attack. The divine flames turned into a flame phoenix. It spread its marvelous wings and soared towards the seven people.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!"</p>

  <p>Without a second thought, Cleon and the others took out their Other Shore Tokens as well.</p>

  <p>Among the children of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Feng Ge, Cleon, Chance and another four were at the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Even though they had already accepted the fact that they were no match for those powerful beings, all they could do now was leap into the breach. In any case, there was no way out of it so they had to fight with all their might.</p>

  <p>"Buzz..."</p>

  <p>As Feng Ge watched her mother's back, her weary face was suddenly filled with burning determination. With that, she also jumped upwards and followed Concubine Yan.</p>

  <p>At this point, all of the powerful concubines had taken out their own Other Shore Tokens. They were completely ready to fight for their lives.</p>

  <p>Jean was previously in a state of panic. But as soon as she saw her sons join the fray, all of her fears vanished. She no longer had any care in the world and was now prepared to risk everything. With that, she also joined the other warriors.</p>

  <p>The leader of those from the Black Jade Clan was clad in all black. To him, Eastern Emperor Taiyi's family members merely seemed pathetic with their hopeless attempt to fight back. He sneered as he saw them charging towards him and his group. "Don't show any mercy. Kill them all!" he ordered them with such apathy and arrogance.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As soon as he said that, he stretched out his hands and soared towards Concubine Yan.</p>

  <p>The divine flames of Concubine Yan were extremely sharp. However, her energy had been severely depleted while she was controlling the Three-Element Sword Array. She had not regained much energy since then, so her face was still deathly pale. When she directed the fire phoenix to attack the man in black, the man's eyes glinted with a bright green light. Almost simultaneously, he launched a soul attack towards Concubine Yan.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan had already reached the ultimate level of the Indigo Soul.</p>

  <p>Therefore, her soul was extremely stable. Under normal circumstances, she would not be afraid of the soul attack at all. However, she was utterly exhausted now. So now, she could not withstand it.</p>

  <p>When the soul attack hit her, she instantly felt dizzy. Seeing this, the man in black took advantage of this window of opportunity to get near her.</p>

  <p>He had a dagger equipped in both of his hands. He used them to attack and aimed them at Concubine Yan's neck.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Even though the two daggers seemed plain and ordinary, their explosive power was actually insanely terrifying.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Concubine Yan was a well-known master. After countless years of nurture, the Chaotic Source Spirits in her body had been absolutely strong.</p>

  <p>Her seemingly delicate neck had effectively withstood the attack.</p>

  <p>But as the Chaotic Source Spirits helped her block the damage, they instantly felt worn-out. If she was slashed with those daggers again, she would definitely die.</p>

  <p>Good thing she finally regained her consciousness at the most critical moment. Concubine Yan gritted her teeth and swerved. She stretched out her hand and gave a sudden blow.</p>

  <p>"Take this!"</p>

  <p>The divine flames looked like petals attached to her palm. With a gentle flick, the heat evaporated instantly. The man in black's initial plan was to launch another slashing attack. But right now, he had no choice but to fall back for a bit.</p>

  <p>However, he only took a step back and vanished. With the speed of light, he immediately reappeared behind Concubine Yan, stabbing one dagger deeply into her back.</p>

  <p>Puff!</p>

  <p>Just as the other dagger was about to slash at her head, a figure rushed towards them. "Mother!" the other person cried out in shock and fear.</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan was in extreme pain from the attack. Now, she also looked very anxious when she heard Feng Ge's voice. This was not the battle Feng Ge could participate in!</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Feng Ge didn't care about anything else. She had to save her mother! She activated the power of the Other Shore Token in her body and quickly held onto the man's arm as tightly as she could!</p>

  <p>"Unhand me!" the man in black commanded.</p>

  <p>He didn't expect that Feng Ge would appear out of nowhere. In his anger, he gathered his strength in his arm and instantly struck her with his elbow.</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly, a warrior with such terrifying power could easily split mountains and earth with his strength. This elbow strike contained over ten thousand Jun of force.</p>

  <p>The blow hit Feng Ge's chest. In an instant, she went limp and fell down from the sky like a stone sinking into deep water.</p>

  <p>"No! Feng Ge!"</p>

  <p>Concubine Yan screamed in pain and anguish.</p>

  <p>Seeing her daughter struck down, she released even more blazing divine flames. She intended to use them to envelop the man in black. However, he seemed to have expected this. He merely leaped back a little and a green light flashed in his eyes again. It was another incoming soul attack!</p>

  <p>This made Concubine Yan feel dizzy again. In addition to that, the man in black thrust the two daggers simultaneously towards her head.</p>

  <p>Since Concubine Yan couldn't withstand the soul attack, she wouldn't be able to avoid the two daggers as well. It looked like there was no escape. She was now staring death right in the face.</p>

  <p>Just as the daggers were about to pierce through her head, a flying sword came out of nowhere. It appeared as though it had been thrown from afar.</p>

  <p>The flying sword was flickering as though it was shuttling through space in such an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>Cling! Cling!</p>

  <p>The flying sword hit the two daggers with such unbelievable accuracy. It effectively stopped the attack as the daggers rebounded.</p>

  <p>"Who in the world threw that?!"</p>

  <p>Anger was written all over the man's face. He had the perfect opportunity to finish off Concubine Yan.</p>

  <p>He believed that the Bearing race already had full control of the situation.</p>

  <p>The Dark Jade Clan just had to deal with all the family members of Eastern Emperor Taiyi. It never crossed his mind that there would be any other changes to their original plan.</p>

  <p>However, he was immediately dumbfounded as he angrily looked toward the direction of the flying sword and saw who had interfered.</p>

  <p>There, in the distance, was Pearce who approached them swiftly along with the other six mountain leaders. Beside Pearce were the three evil eyes that Auden had summoned. He was the one who thrust the flying sword.</p>

  <p>The man in black was not the only one who was stunned by this unexpected turn of events.</p>

  <p>Hancock and the others were watching the scene unfold while they were in the air. They were flabbergasted when they saw lots of people from the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"Isn't the main force of the Taiyi Heaven Palace currently being suppressed by the Jin Wu? What happened?" one of them asked confusedly.</p>

  <p>"There's no doubt that the Jin Wu has the ability to obliterate them all!"</p>

  <p>"But how are they here? Did something happen?"</p>

  <p>There were only over forty people from the Bearing race left. Meanwhile, the number of people from the Taiyi Heaven Palace was twice as big.</p>

  <p>When it came to sheer strength, the people from the Bearing race were extremely powerful. However, they were not the strongest group of the Bearing race. And now, they were clearly outnumbered.</p>

  <p>Realizing this, they immediately felt desperate. The situation suddenly turned bleak and it seemed like the tide had turned against them.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, another group was fast approaching from the other side.</p>

  <p>As Hancock and the others took a closer look, they felt overjoyed. It looked like they had a chance after all because the members of the Jin Wu were coming!</p>

  <p>In addition to that, they had also seen Micah and Bagot in the group.</p>

  <p>"Hooray! It's the Jin Wu!" shouted one of the members of the Bearing race.</p>

  <p>"Their timing is absolutely perfect!"</p>

  <p>"Whew! We are saved. As long as we join hands with the Jin Wu, we will be able to defeat the Taiyi Heaven Palace!"</p>

  <p>However, they didn't know that Gethin had the same thought before.</p>

  <p>"Micah, we..."</p>

  <p>Hancock looked at him admiringly. After all, the strength and status of Micah were far greater and higher than his. Even Ware, who led the team here this time, couldn't quite compare to Micah's might and prowess.</p>

  <p>But before Hancock could even finish his sentence, he noticed another figure standing in front of Micah. It was none other than Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's face was drained of color when he saw Feng Ge lying motionlessly on the ground. He didn't know whether she was alive or dead.</p>

  <p>He had initially thought that the Phoenix Palace was the safest place to go, so he let Xun, Liusu, and Nelly stay here. Clearly, he wasn't expecting that Eastern Emperor Taiyi would be trapped and the Bearing race would launch a sneak attack on the Phoenix Palace.</p>

  <p>"Slaughter them all," Luo Zheng commanded mercilessly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir! Right away!"</p>

  <p>Micah, Bagot, and the others answered without any second thoughts.</p>

  <p>The longer the modified blood stayed in their bodies, the more loyal they became to Emperor Di Jun and Luo Zheng. This was the true power of bloodline worship.</p>
