<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After giving some time to adapt, Zheng's ability to control the Shade Stone liquid only grew stronger.</p>

  <p>It could be absorbed into his viscera, bones, or skin. When he resisted his enemies, he could shift the impact to the position where the Shade Stone liquid was placed. With the liquid, he attempted to take every strike from Chance.</p>

  <p>Even though Chance released a thousand divine megatons of force, Zheng blocked all his attacks with ease.</p>

  <p>"I told you to take the fight more seriously. Show me what you've got!" Zheng called out as he looked at Chance with calm eyes.</p>

  <p>Chance knew Zheng was a disciple of the Oneness Sky Palace who hadn't reached the Chaotic Source Realm, but Zheng appeared so calm as though Chance was an ordinary warrior.</p>

  <p>It was completely beyond his expectations. Zheng's leisurely attitude hurt his pride? he began growing restless.</p>

  <p>Chance refused to yield or heed Zheng's words. Instead, he gently slid his feet, moving particularly elegantly as he charged at Zheng.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong the disciple was, everyone had a limit. Chance refused to believe that Zheng could continue resisting his attacks for long.</p>

  <p>But under Chance's rain of punches, Zheng showed no sign of panic.</p>

  <p>Not only could he block Chance's fists, but he also managed to launch his counterattack from time to time.</p>

  <p>In terms of force alone, Zheng was incredibly strong when he used the Strength God Totem. Each and every punch he threw at his opponent contained over a thousand divine megatons of force. Besides, the Shade Stone liquid strengthened his body dramatically. His counterattacks weren't to be underestimated.</p>

  <p>But Chance was a powerful warrior of the Chaotic Source Realm. His body was far stronger than any opponent Zheng had faced before.</p>

  <p>Ordinary warriors of the Other Shore Realm would have been torn to shreds if they took one of Zheng's hits. But Chance's body was like iron. Zheng couldn't even make a dent.</p>

  <p>Loud thuds resounded every time their punches met. From the noises they made, anyone could easily assume that two giants were brawling. The exchange of blows continued as they moved across the area.</p>

  <p>The other disciples knew it was good to distance themselves from the intense fight.</p>

  <p>Every time the two collided, the impact caused something like a violent explosion. Anyone standing too close could easily be caught in the impact and get injured. Several disciples already had cheeks that were bulging out because of the blast wave.</p>

  <p>As they watched the fierce combat, all of them were stunned frozen, their jaws hanging open with shock.</p>

  <p>They all knew that Chance was a powerful warrior. But what about Zheng?</p>

  <p>The caliber of the fight was nothing short of a fight between two powerful warriors of the Chaotic Source Realm. But the fact that Zheng hadn't even reached the Chaotic Source Realm in spite of his power was bewildering.</p>

  <p>How on earth did he come to possess such great power?</p>

  <p>"Zheng has become stronger once again?" Nelly remarked, her eyes twinkling.</p>

  <p>"He gets stronger every time I see him," Xun added. "He never seems to stop improving himself."</p>

  <p>Among the three, Xun was the one who had been in Zheng's company for the longest period of time.</p>

  <p>He had grown stronger, all the way from the Lower World to the Upper World, and from the universe to the divine land. Xun was used to seeing his extraordinary performance in battle.</p>

  <p>In the back of his mind, even Chance was greatly shocked.</p>

  <p>He had a growing suspicion that Zheng wasn't human at all. 'Is this guy's body made out of some legendary weapon?' he wondered to himself.</p>

  <p>While Chance's body was extremely strong after going through Chaotic Source Reinforcement, it couldn't resist any attack indefinitely. After a certain amount of damage, his body would weaken like any other. If his fatigue reached a limit, his physical strength would decline rapidly.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Zheng still seemed in high spirits even after taking so many punches. He didn't look the least bit exhausted.</p>

  <p>"Back off!"</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Chance lowered himself, tilting his shoulder. Gathering his strength, he threw another punch, forcing Zheng back and buying time to rest.</p>

  <p>Zheng then retreated, sliding back on the ground to put some distance between them. His movements were gentle and light, his face as calm as still water.</p>

  <p>There were no signs of fatigue in his actions.</p>

  <p>Most of the power from Chance's attacks was blocked by the Shade Stone liquid. Zheng's body structure was essentially different from Ahmad's. Zheng would have the advantage if they were to fight in protracted combat.</p>

  <p>The direct descendants watching from the side had noticed the difference in their states. It wasn't hard to tell who had the upper hand during such a fight.</p>

  <p>"Ahmad, your brother seems exhausted," one of them remarked.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" Ahmad rebutted furiously. "Just wait and see. My brother will cut him in half!"</p>

  <p>Ahmad's brother was a role model to him? a goal he had pursued all his life. He refused to see his brother fall to defeat before a mere, unknown disciple.</p>

  <p>Chance's eyes were now fixated on Zheng? they were as malicious as a serpent's. Although he hadn't activated the Other Shore Token to its extreme, his opponent didn't seem to have done so either. Now, Zheng seemed unfathomable.</p>

  <p>It was a ridiculous feeling, Chance thought. His long arms drooped to the side, and his fingers gently brushed against his space ring. Blood began gurgling out of it.</p>

  <p>But instead of dripping onto the ground, it flowed until it formed a shape of a snowflake. Chance then pulled out a great, long, red sword from the center of the figure.</p>

  <p>"Since you insist that I use my sword, it would be rude of me not to,"</p>

  <p>Chance said, raising his weapon arrogantly. "I must warn you, however, my sword has no conscience. If it cuts your head off by accident, don't complain about it on your way to hell!"</p>

  <p>As Chance brandished the red sword, the Other Shore Token he carried in his inner world also emerged? it turned out to be a tiny mountain.</p>

  <p>It was the Weightless Mountain, an Other Shore Token from Stage Fourteen.</p>

  <p>Numerous tall and dangerous mountains were scattered on Stage Fourteen of the Desire World. The mountain spirit of them could be integrated by warriors as an Other Shore Token. Despite its light weight, the mountain spirit held incredible power, standing out from many Other Shore tokens of the strengthening type.</p>

  <p>The Weightless Mountain had divided grades? Chance's Weightless Mountain was superior, containing more divine megatons of force than any ordinary mountain spirit.</p>

  <p>His display of this token showed a clear desire to end the battle as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>With a gentle shake of the Weightless Mountain, Chance's aura strengthened drastically. When he took a heavy step forward, his red sword slashed at Zheng as he approached.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>His sword left a long, red trail in the air. It seemed to carry the power to cut through anything in the world.</p>

  <p>In the face of Chance's ferocity, Zheng's face turned grim.</p>

  <p>The realization hit him: he couldn't take the strike head-on.</p>

  <p>Withdrawing his body, Zheng leaped high into the air and evaded Chance's sharp hit.</p>

  <p>But now that Chance had displayed his Other Shore Token, he surely wasn't going to give Zheng any chance to run away.</p>

  <p>"Nine-world Mantra!</p>

  <p>Binding him!"</p>

  <p>Chance gently shook his sword's blade, making its radiance twist and shoot at Zheng aggressively like a nimble gecko.</p>

  <p>The Nine-world Mantra Sword was a supreme swordsmanship manual unique to the Phoenix Palace. With Chance's formidable strength, the power of his skill was thousands of times greater than when Ahmad had used it? Zheng couldn't find a single flaw in his attack.</p>

  <p>As Zheng retreated, he continued moving and dodging, but failed to get out of the binding force's range.</p>

  <p>It was an unavoidable technique, even for Zheng, because the skill reached a wider area instead of a single point.</p>

  <p>There was so much going on that Zheng could barely process the situation.</p>

  <p>But because he couldn't keep dodging, his right eye suddenly flashed with a red light.</p>

  <p>Initially, Chance had planned to completely eliminate Zheng in a single attack.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he spotted the red light, his heart skipped a beat, and his attack waned.</p>

  <p>Zheng seized the opportunity to twist his body abruptly and distance himself from his opponent.</p>
