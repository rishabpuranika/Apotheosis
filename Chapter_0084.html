<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 84 An Angry Master Su (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The tasks in this pamphlet were beyond Zheng's capabilities.</p>

  <p>Even though it seemed senseless, Zheng continued to scan the pages and came on another task.</p>

  <p>There was no set amount for this task. Instead, it offered a range between a single point and many thousands of points.</p>

  <p>Reading this task through carefully, Zheng noted the mission was to resist an insect assault.</p>

  <p>Insect attacks were a big problem plaguing the southern part of the empire.</p>

  <p>From April to May every year, a massive influx of blade locusts carried devastating disasters to the south.</p>

  <p>There was no such thing as simple where blade locusts were concerned.</p>

  <p>Unlike common insects, each blade locust was the size of a human adult.</p>

  <p>In order to resist an invasion of blade locusts, the Empire dispatched large numbers of troops yearly to travel south and eliminate them.</p>

  <p>But, the Empire's forces weren't enough, and many were sent south from the Cloud Sect too.</p>

  <p>That was why the task was offered in the pamphlet.</p>

  <p>"For killing twenty blade locusts, you receive a point. If you slay a blade locust leader, you will get another point..." Zheng calculated the numbers in his head quickly. Shortly after that, he said, "Master Su, I'd like to accept the task of repelling an insect invasion!"</p>

  <p>When Master Su heard Zheng, she gave a subtle yet sly grin and blinked in an exaggerated manner while she asked, "You're wise to pick that task.</p>

  <p>It's the only task in that pamphlet you're able to handle, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled but didn't deny it.</p>

  <p>He couldn't afford to care about how he earned the points, Zheng just needed to obtain them.</p>

  <p>A moment ago, Master Su was still laughing, but as quickly, her face changed. "No, don't go!"</p>

  <p>The smile on Zheng's face was stiff as he asked, "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Do you believe it's easy to kill blade locusts? Some refiners who were half-step into the nature level accepted this task, but, only forty percent of them came back! Did you know that?" demanded Master Su as she stared deep into Zheng's eyes. With the strength that Zheng possessed, how would he kill blade locusts? He would die.</p>

  <p>"I know!" replied Zheng as he nodded firmly.</p>

  <p>"Great," said Master Su, as she nodded back. Satisfied, Master Su reached to take the book from Zheng.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw her reaching for it, he gripped the pamphlet. "That doesn't change the fact that I need to take this task."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Master Su burst into laughter so hard, that tears rolled down her face and gracelessly, she chided, "You know shit! In any event, don't go!"</p>

  <p>Furrowing his brows, Zheng's eyes were dark and grave as he said in an earnest timbre, "Master Su, I know you're only thinking about my safety, but, I really need to earn points. So, I have no choice but to accept the task at hand, whether you want me to or not..."</p>

  <p>Looking up into Zheng's eyes, Aura Su saw how serious he was. Her beautiful eyes shone with intense color as well as skepticism. "Why are you so zealous to get points?"</p>

  <p>Reluctant to tell her, Zheng pursed his lips and shook his head. He stood as motionless as a wooden pestle. Even if she wouldn't assign him the task, Zheng wasn't ready to leave.</p>

  <p>"No? Then, you can't take on this task," snapped Aura. This guy was as stubborn as a mule.</p>

  <p>"But? Master Su, I must accept this assignment!" repeated Zheng as the pitch of his voice rose in a panic-like sound.</p>

  <p>Not wanting to argue with Zheng, Master Su picked up her pen, bent her head back over the work littering her desk, and resumed working.</p>

  <p>That only left Zheng one option, and he would kill time waiting.</p>

  <p>For the whole day, the two shared the space, but neither shared any more words.</p>

  <p>Busy with her work, Master Su treated Zheng as though he didn't exist.</p>

  <p>Standing next to her, motionless, Zheng resembled a statue.</p>

  <p>This strange situation lasted through the day and into the evening.</p>

  <p>Finally, Master Su moved and gave Zheng a sharp look.</p>

  <p>In all honesty, when Master Su met Zheng, she liked him very much.</p>

  <p>Now though, she felt disgusted.</p>

  <p>It was true that Zheng's strength, the speed of his progress and his tenacity facing enemies were all outstanding traits.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Master Su, that Zheng wanted the task as soon as possible so he could train and prove himself faster.</p>

  <p>This wasn't wrong, but Master Su thought Zheng was too eager for instant gratification.</p>

  <p>As Master Su prepared to leave for the day, she continued ignoring Zheng and headed toward the door.</p>

  <p>Just when she got to the door, Master Su spun around and flung a shiny token at Zheng. "Go ahead, if you want to die! Nobody's standing in your way!"</p>

  <p>Master Su was proud that she could spot talent by sight. She knew from the start that Zheng's strength was much more than he had shown. Still, insect invasions were deadly. Among them, were not only normal blade locusts but, there were also much more powerful creatures, increasing the likelihood of Zheng perishing from wounds.</p>

  <p>If Master Su remained calm, she could talk Zheng out of taking part in this task.</p>

  <p>The problem was Zheng was too eager for instant rewards and success which annoyed Master Su and she wasn't able to stay calm.</p>

  <p>Throwing the token at Zheng was just an act of emotion, and women were known to be emotionally driven creatures.</p>

  <p>Immediately, Master Su regretted snapping at Zheng. After all, he was the disciple she worked so hard to get into her Peak, and it was counterproductive to let him go off to die.</p>

  <p>Turning her head with the intention of speaking to Zheng, she saw Zheng's beaming face, thrilled at the sight of the token, which sparked her temper once more and she shot Zheng an angry look and disappeared through the courtyard.</p>

  <p>Not being a fool, Zheng knew very well he had made Master Su mad.</p>

  <p>But, he couldn't be concerned about that right now. He needed to earn points so he could save his sister, Yan.</p>
