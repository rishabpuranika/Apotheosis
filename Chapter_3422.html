<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The moment they saw the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits rush over, all creatures in the third array began to scramble and scatter.</p>

  <p>At that moment, all that mattered was leaving as fast as they could, or they would risk dying in that place.</p>

  <p>All of them crowded the exit, trying to rush out of the array. They used their bodily movement skills to fly with the wind, all in a desperate attempt to run away from the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p id="top_5">When the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits reached the magic array, she crushed the array with her body, making sure to destroy it completely.</p>

  <p>Several large races were forced to calculate their current positions, trying to guess what the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits would do next.</p>

  <p>The core area's arrays were arranged densely. When the hurricane rose, everyone found a random array where they stayed to protect themselves.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice, the Bearing race, and the Sun Crow race were among the lucky ones as they were in arrays that were quite far from the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the Nine Li people weren't as lucky.</p>

  <p>However, within five minutes, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits could destroy all the arrays.</p>

  <p>Everyone was on the edge. Even the leaders outside of the Chaotic Source World were growing restless.</p>

  <p>"Why isn't the Pear Hill doing anything?"</p>

  <p>"The arrays used to refine the Chaotic Source Spirits are ruined! This is too much!"</p>

  <p>"If they stay there, they will all die!"</p>

  <p>The leaders argued amongst themselves, despairing at the current state of their disciples while the Pear Hill kept silent. Making a move on the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits was never in their plan.</p>

  <p>In no time at all, the fourth, fifth, and sixth arrays were destroyed.</p>

  <p>Having witnessed the unfortunate fate of the River Spirit race, the others were desperate to leave and find another safe hiding spot.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the super forces in the rear became more anxious about their situation.</p>

  <p>The arrays themselves weren't such a huge loss. The mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits could destroy all of them.</p>

  <p>What made them so nervous was the fact that they used the arrays as shelter.</p>

  <p>It was extremely nerve-wracking, waiting for one's possible doom.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace and the people of the Nine Li race were desolate as they watched the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits approach their array.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to withdraw!" Elvinia exclaimed, heart beating faster from the need to take action.</p>

  <p>"Don't panic. She may not come for us," Chaim said with a hint of hope.</p>

  <p>Earlier, the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits flew into a rage and missed an array. Maybe they could also get lucky?</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Chaim was wrong.</p>

  <p>As the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits broke the thirteenth array, she began to rush straight towards the one they were in.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess race from Pear Hill was in a nearby array. Yan, who was inside the array, could only look at Zheng with worry.</p>

  <p>She knew there was nothing she could do to help.</p>

  <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

  <p>Violent vibrations shook the ground as the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits stamped in fury.</p>

  <p>Not everyone felt as melancholic. The Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race were particularly feeling pleased as they watched the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits march towards the array.</p>

  <p>"Look! The Oneness Sky Palace is doomed!"</p>

  <p>"I hope the hurricane blows them away! When they're gone, the crystals in the mother's belly will be ours!"</p>

  <p>"If the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace run away, so will the people of Pear Hill! There's a way to turn this situation to our advantage!"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Bearing race, the Sun Crow race, and the Divine Farmer race discussed amongst themselves the benefits of this current situation.</p>

  <p>Ismail, the eldest among the three brothers from the Divine Farmer race raised a very good question, "Is there any way to prevent them from leaving the array?" His voice was full of resentment as he made his declaration. "I hope they're trampled to death by the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits!"</p>

  <p>Mount, taking a glance at Ismail, shook his head. "No. I don't think so."</p>

  <p>There was no way to trap the disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace in the array.</p>

  <p>Dorothy watched as the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits approached.</p>

  <p>"We have to go!" she announced solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up then!" Hutton whined anxiously.</p>

  <p>There was no other way!</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was preparing to rush out, Zheng remained rooted in his spot.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute."</p>

  <p>Chaim took a look at Zheng and immediately guessed his plan. "Are you planning on luring her away?"</p>

  <p>Amongst everyone gathered here in the core area, there was only one person who could dodge this abnormally horrible hurricane: Zheng.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it would also be possible for him to lure the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits away?</p>

  <p>"Yes," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"How?" Milo asked. Even Dorothy was confused, only gazing at Zheng with questioning eyes.</p>

  <p>She, and the vast majority of the Oneness Sky Palace disciples, had no idea that he could dodge the hurricane.</p>

  <p>Zheng was a source of order and leadership for everyone in that array. He had led them to victory during the earlier battle and they trusted in him fully.</p>

  <p>They saw him as someone who could come up with solutions in the most critical moments.</p>

  <p>However, what he was planning right now seemed like suicide! Could he really deal with this current dilemma they all faced?</p>

  <p>The other races watched with bated breath, anticipating what the Oneness Sky Palace was going to do. With their current situation, the most logical course of action was to rush out of the array as quickly as they could.</p>

  <p>To everyone's disappointment, no disciples rushed out of the array.</p>

  <p>The only person who did was Zheng.</p>

  <p>This scene shocked everybody.</p>

  <p>"What are they doing?!"</p>

  <p>"Are they trying to get themselves killed?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe they aren't willing to give up? But what option do they have other than giving up? They're going to die. There's no other way out of this one.</p>

  <p>Those fools will die in that array!"</p>

  <p>While everyone mildly panicked about this turn of events, Zheng had already passed the light curtain.</p>

  <p>As soon as he crossed the threshold, a feather seemingly carved out of jade appeared above his head.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Everyone watched in amazement as Zheng flew upward, unaffected by the hurricane at all, and rushed headfirst towards the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits. Meanwhile, the blade of his Snow Sword flashed sharply in his hand.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>This sword radiance from his blade hit the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>It did not hurt the creature but it was very successful in diverting her attention.</p>

  <p>Dong! Dong!</p>

  <p>There was a large quake as the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits turned from the array and towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>She was very, very confused.</p>

  <p>To the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits, all of them were pesky annoying ants unable to even withstand the force of the hurricane. How in the world was this ant able to travel freely?</p>

  <p>Not only that, he even dared to come at her with a sword?</p>

  <p>"Human ant!" the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits boomed. "Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>She turned around, swinging her two huge palms in order to slap Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Zheng, despite being regarded as a mere ant, was very nimble and could easily dodge the strike.</p>

  <p>He was like a mosquito, flitting here and there in order to avoid this larger creature's slap. Wasting no time at all, Zheng drew his sword and slashed at her head!</p>

  <p>Those watching below could only gasp in shock as they witnessed this scene.</p>

  <p>Who would've ever guessed that Zheng would employ this method in order to lure the mother of the Chaotic Source Spirits away?</p>

  <p>Mount, Khalid, and Mya sported unprecedentedly solemn looks on their faces.</p>

  <p>"Uncle Mount, how the hell did he make it?" Mya asked in disbelief and confusion.</p>
