  <p>
</p>

  <p>Gethin did plan to join the Jin Wu's attacks on the Taiyi Heaven Palace eventually, but at a critical moment to deliver the fatal blow.</p>

  <p>While the Sky Net remained in place, the Vastness Mountain wouldn't dare make a move.</p>

  <p>They couldn't risk revealing their hand in the conspiracy too early. For now, he had to continue pretending to be on the side of the other six mountains.</p>

  <p>He had to wait for the right moment to strike and make his rebellion known.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Luo Zheng remained on guard near the Sky Net even after seizing control of the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu.</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu still hadn't made a move, even as the Sky Net continued shrinking. It was clear a storm was brewing.</p>

  <p>A voice suddenly piped up in Luo Zheng's head. "General Luo Zheng, please come to the Taiyi Array."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng quickly recognized the voice. It was Pearce, the master who had once scolded him in the Supreme Dragon Hall.</p>

  <p>Not that it mattered to Luo Zheng now. It was but a distant memory in this time of war.</p>

  <p>With his mind, he directed the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu to fly to the Taiyi Array. They headed out in a neat formation.</p>

  <p>They soon arrived at a magnificent array of Lofty Swords.</p>

  <p>Each one was occupied by a master from the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cupped his hands in front of him and bowed to them respectfully.</p>

  <p>The masters eyed the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu, which all emanated such gloomy and powerful auras they subconsciously made anyone observing them keep their guard up.</p>

  <p>The Taiyi Array was consisted of Lofty Swords arranged in a wedge-shaped formation: One in front, then others widening to the back on both sides.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue, who occupied a Lofty Sword at one end of the array, craned her neck to finally catch a glimpse of this Luo Zheng people kept talking about.</p>

  <p>The disciples on the first and second floors of the Land of Sword Grief were in different arrays of the twelve passes, while the disciples on the third floor were in the arrays of the seven mountains.</p>

  <p>This was because the disciples on the first and second floors were closest to Taiyi Generals in terms of strength, while the disciples on the third floor were most similar to Taiyi Governors.</p>

  <p>This didn't explain, however, why the powerful Li Bianxue was placed at the end of the array.</p>

  <p>She was definitely not weaker than the masters of the Taiyi Mountain.</p>

  <p>She had simply been placed in a less prominent position because of her junior status.</p>

  <p>After joining the array, she had been sitting quietly on the Lofty Sword, waiting for orders.</p>

  <p>She was not qualified to participate in the decision-making yet. She was only subject to the more senior masters' commands during battle.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue now stared at the new arrival. When Pearce and the others had been discussing Luo Zheng earlier, Li Bianxue hadn't been paying much attention.</p>

  <p>She was just now realizing she had seen Luo Zheng before. She had already encountered him in the Land of Sword Grief, but he had left such a weak impression in her mind then that she didn't even bother catching his name.</p>

  <p>She never imagined that guy would be the famous Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her eyes narrowed at him.</p>

  <p>'This is the guy who ranks first on the second floor?</p>

  <p>I would never have thought he was the same person Elder Pearce and Elder Auden were talking about!'</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue thought to herself, scoffing with incredulity.</p>

  <p>Word in the Land of Sword Grief was, this Luo Zheng's talent was extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Some had even said he could surpass Li Bianxue. But she refused to accept he could match up to her in only a few months. Over her dead body.</p>

  <p>He was probably just another over-hyped upstart.</p>

  <p>She did wonder, however, how a new disciple on the second floor managed to turn the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu over to his side.</p>

  <p>She couldn't deny that accomplishment. He was accompanied by the crows, after all.</p>

  <p>'Hmph! He probably just stumbled upon a special method by sheer luck, '</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue thought to herself disdainfully, looking Luo Zheng over with a raised eyebrow.</p>

  <p>She had always been the pride of the Taiyi Heaven Palace. She didn't even take the mountain chiefs' sons seriously. Why would some newbie disciple impress her?</p>

  <p>She was confident enough in her strength to take on masters like Qiu Yinhe and Goran. Luo Zheng probably couldn't even compete on the same level.</p>

  <p>As he straightened up, Luo Zheng spotted Li Bianxue in the array.</p>

  <p>He was a bit surprised she was in the formation, but he figured disciples on the third floor were qualified to join the great arrays, anyway. Shrugging it off, he continued riding the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow toward Pearce.</p>

  <p>Li Bianxue slit her eyes. She was sure Luo Zheng had caught sight of her, yet he didn't even acknowledge her. She glowered at being so disregarded.</p>

  <p>"You summoned me, Elder Pearce?" Luo Zheng asked, as he approached.</p>

  <p>Pearce eyed the Corpse Spirit Sun Crow hovering beneath Luo Zheng's feet. "Yes, it was me. But first, I must apologize, Luo Zheng, for my behavior before. Forgive my indiscretion," he said humbly.</p>

  <p>To punctuate his words, he bowed deeply before Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>That Pearce, one of the founding members of the Taiyi Heaven Palace, would humble himself before Luo Zheng this way surely boosted Luo Zheng's status.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, please, sir, it was no issue at all! No offense taken!" Luo Zheng waved his hands frantically in embarrassment.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Auden chimed in. "You truly deserve not only our apologies, General Luo Zheng, but also our gratitude. Without you, we would have been in deep trouble by now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was taken aback by Auden's words.</p>

  <p>He only had the guts to steal the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu from Phoenix simply because he was confident the Taiyi Heaven Palace had his back. He didn't realize, until now that Auden highlighted it, that he had made a rather crucial move they hadn't even thought of.</p>

  <p>"Since these crows are under your control now, General Luo Zheng, we hope you can assist us when the Jin Wu breaks through," Pearce implored him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "It would be my honor. I came here on Master Goran's call-to-arms. It is my duty to fight for the Taiyi Heaven Palace. But if I may ask, what is the situation now?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng guessed Phoenix had a greater force behind her, but he knew nothing about the details, nor how the Taiyi Heaven Palace planned to deal with it.</p>

  <p>Pearce trained his eyes on the shrinking Sky Net. "If I'm guessing right, there should be a great array behind Phoenix. After the Sky Net shrinks to a certain extent, the Jin Wu will launch their full attack."</p>

  <p>As the other six arrays and eleven passes continued to move, the circular Sky Net kept contracting toward its center.</p>

  <p>Strong as Phoenix was, she had no choice for now but to fall back in the face of the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be seen in the space behind her.</p>

  <p>With a series of caws, the Jin Wu swooped in from all corners of the sky to gather in the area behind Phoenix. They all disappeared in groups as soon as they reached that spot.</p>

  <p>The Sky Net shrunk to only 800 miles across.</p>

  <p>500 miles.</p>

  <p>200 miles.</p>

  <p>50 miles.</p>

  <p>As the span of the Sky Net continued to shrink, the distance between the twelve passes and the seven arrays also decreased.</p>

  <p>The mountain chiefs all guarded their large arrays as they observed the Sky Net warily.</p>

  <p>No one would let their guard down, not even if the Jin Wu were successfully caught in the Sky Net.</p>

  <p>The Sky Net shrunk further.</p>

  <p>It was only 25 miles wide now!</p>

  <p>The Jin Wu was now only one step closer to the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Up in the sky, all the other Jin Wu had seemingly disappeared, save for Phoenix.</p>

  <p>Phoenix exhaled and moved her hands. Six dots of light emerged behind her, flickered, and quickly expanded into six hexagonal seals. Together, they formed an immense array.</p>
