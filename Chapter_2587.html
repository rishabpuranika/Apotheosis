  <p>
</p>

  <p>Using dozens of forceful strikes in a row, Lisa pummeled Zheng. The way he dodged every single one of them made her anxious.</p>

  <p>She then took a few steps back and stomped on the hard ground in tiptoe, creating a pit that went three to four hundred feet deep. Clasped tightly in her hand was the thin black sword.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing her make such a move, Lisa's brother couldn't help but frown slightly. "I can sense Lisa's uneasiness, but this time, let's see how this fellow would survive that one."</p>

  <p>"Amorous Sword Net!" Lisa exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!"</p>

  <p>The thin black sword looked and moved like a whip as it flew out of Lisa's hand.</p>

  <p>In just a split second, streaks of what seemed like a bundle of black swords intertwined and formed a tangled net that swiftly enveloped Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>Since the net was fine-meshed, it was impossible for Zheng to break free no matter what he did.</p>

  <p>"How can Zheng escape from this?" Elsa's eyes widened as she watched the scene with great concern.</p>

  <p>The striking eyebrows that rested on Romeo's forehead trembled lightly at the view.</p>

  <p>Previously, he was downright defeated by that exact move by Lisa. He was trapped in a cage formed by the black sword net and failed to break out no matter how much he struggled.</p>

  <p>Seeing the massive black sword net charging towards him caused Zheng's eyes to flicker while the corner of his mouth raised slightly.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods used martial skills to fight as well.</p>

  <p>The weapons they used would become wild weapons that were way larger, and the Wild Gods themselves would also grow.</p>

  <p>In terms of skills alone, Zheng wasn't threatened by anyone at all.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>Zheng raised his long sword and used it to hurl the sword net in another direction.</p>

  <p>"Clank!"</p>

  <p>A loud sound cut through the thick air.</p>

  <p>Zheng had successfully blocked one of the strips of the black sword radiance.</p>

  <p>A huge hole appeared on the thin net.</p>

  <p>Aware that it was just a casual sword strike from Zheng, Lisa was stunned.</p>

  <p>The swordsmanship she used had quite an unyielding demand with space. Once she performed it, it went on for a while, resembling a cage that could crush her opponents. The more they struggled, the deeper they fell.</p>

  <p>However, that one she just exerted obviously wasn't perfection. There were a total of four flaws that could be seen on the net.</p>

  <p>If her opponents managed to discover those flaws, they could break the entire sword net.</p>

  <p>There was only one warrior who easily did such a thing, and that was David.</p>

  <p>It was a surprise to her how Zheng found the first flaw that quick. Was it just a mere coincidence, or could he really find them all out?</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>David, who was just quietly watching the match as he lay on the ground, was now up on both feet.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that such a powerful man from the Nine Li ever existed."</p>

  <p>David's eyes widened, his curiosity growing by the minute.</p>

  <p>Lancelot, along with the other elders from the Yellow Emperor race, couldn't quite put a finger on what just went down as well.</p>

  <p>"Why would the Nine Li race hide such a powerful man from us?"</p>

  <p>"This isn't right. If such a powerful warrior really existed in the Nine Li race, how come we know nothing about him?"</p>

  <p>"Calm down, all of you. Lisa isn't going to lose."</p>

  <p>Even if Lisa lost the match, they still had Jerome and David.</p>

  <p>They could lose this round but would still be on an advantage, for Zheng was the only warrior the Nine Li race had left.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Lisa flourished her black sword without pause. In the blink of an eye, the hole Zheng had created earlier was remedied by the black sword radiance.</p>

  <p>It looked brand new once again.</p>

  <p>At the same time, she also began to move rapidly around Zheng.</p>

  <p>The net spun as she moved. The changes of the net looked even more complicated than before, which meant that Zheng had to work even harder to escape it.</p>

  <p>However, such changes were nothing to Zheng.</p>

  <p>For him, any change at that point was just a deception. The methods that were used varied, but the principle was the same.</p>

  <p>With a smile on his face, Zheng waved his sword and speedily stabbed the net four times.</p>

  <p>"Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank!"</p>

  <p>With four shrill sounds, the sword net that was intricately set up by Lisa collapsed completely.</p>

  <p>All the black sword radiance faded along with the net and the black sword quivered in her hand.</p>

  <p>Lisa's heart sank as she realized that Zheng had actually seen through all her tricks.</p>

  <p>The method she used seemed like a child's play to Zheng.</p>

  <p>"That kind of swordsmanship is useless to me," he said.</p>

  <p>Not taking a step forward, Zheng just stood there.</p>

  <p>He easily and perfectly dodged all of her attacks on him. The difference between the two of them was more evident.</p>

  <p>Lisa could only purse her lips.</p>

  <p>Giving up wasn't an option for her. Even if she knew that her skills didn't stand a chance against Zheng, she still aimed to go all out on him.</p>

  <p>While holding the black sword horizontally, Lisa bent her body and an ethereal spirit flashed in her eyes. After a moment of preparation, she swung her black sword.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Once again, the black sword turned into a long whip, and it rapidly spun around her like a tornado.</p>

  <p>As the sword radiance circled her, it created a streak of sharp black radiance that headed straight for Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Not bad at all," Zheng said, his eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>At the sight of that strike, both Elsa and Romeo held their breaths.</p>

  <p>They thought that they had already seen the best of Lisa, so that killing tactic she had just displayed came off as a shock for them.</p>

  <p>"Zheng has to be careful. This strike can't be resisted by sheer force alone!"</p>

  <p>Romeo said, looking more concerned than ever.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Zheng doesn't seem to really care. Just look at him," Elsa retorted.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng noticed the black sword radiance charging towards him, a light flashed in his eyes. He pointed his green sword at the black sword radiance.</p>

  <p>This gesture from Zheng caused Adele, Giacomo, and the other elders to feel uneasy.</p>

  <p>The others were just as stunned. Was Zheng seeking death?</p>

  <p>Astonishment engulfed Lisa's eyes. She knew that Zheng could resist the strike she just made, but what he was doing at that time was no more than a suicide act.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng's long sword touched the black sword radiance, he began twisting his arm.</p>

  <p>The blade of his long sword slightly twisted as well, and the black radiance circled his sword as if it was being sucked into a whirlpool.</p>

  <p>At the same time, he pulled his long sword instantly, and Lisa felt a massive force coming out of her hand.</p>

  <p>Before she could even throw her sword away, she bumped into Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had placed his sword horizontally by his chest, Lisa would be cut in half should she bump into it.</p>

  <p>"Lisa!"</p>

  <p>Jerome yelled from a distance, desperation evident in his eyes.</p>

  <p>As Lisa got closer to Zheng's sword, her face turned pale. She knew what was coming. She knew she was going to die.</p>

  <p>Just as she was about to hit the tip of the sword, Zheng's other hand gently emerged. With a loud bang, Zheng blocked Lisa's shoulder to avoid her from coming in contact with the blade.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, he lifted his emerald green sword and pointed it just a few inches away from the damp skin of her neck.</p>

  <p>Lisa's mind went blank. She was dazed. Zheng's low voice snapped her back to reality as he said, "You lost."</p>
