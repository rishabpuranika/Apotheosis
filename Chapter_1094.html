<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1094 You Are  Luo Zheng Luo (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Holy Maiden of the York Divine Kingdom was named Marine Bai.</p>

  <p>The Bai Clan was a relatively unknown clan in the York Divine Kingdom, but ever since Marine Bai was born and had been chosen as the Holy Maiden of the secret sect, they had risen to fame.</p>

  <p>Back then, Daniel Liu, the prince of the York Divine Kingdom, whose talent was ranked ninth within the divine kingdom, had obtained an enchanted lamp from the celestial tomb. The lamp was something that a commoner had given to him.</p>

  <p>It was said that there existed a total of nine enchanted lamps in the entire world. Once all of them were lighted, those who held them would be able to enter the celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>Despite waiting for so many years, Daniel Liu had never seen the passageway to the celestial tomb activated. Through time, even Marine Bai had started being curious about it. On the third day of the third month every year, she and Daniel Liu would light the lamp together. At first, they were hopeful, but as time passed, their faith waned. She never imagined that a passageway would actually appear.</p>

  <p>Due to the two of them not having expected what happened, they weren't prepared at all. Because of that, they hurriedly invited a few guards at the Life and Death Realm to enter the celestial tomb with them.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that Daniel Liu's life would be taken away during that trip to the celestial tomb? This matter caused a great stir within the York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>After all, a prince had died. Even though War Emperor York had many sons and daughters, Daniel Liu's talent was still ranked ninth out of the entire York Divine Kingdom. He could be easily considered as one of the most outstanding princes in the divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>What made the whole thing worse was how a nobody from the Sky Northern Region actually dared to go against the York Divine Kingdom!</p>

  <p>Any mighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm from the York Divine Kingdom could charge through the Chaotic Ocean of Stars and easily flatten the entire Sky Northern Region.</p>

  <p>But what Marine Bai did next was arrange for Master Wallace to contact Eddie and Simon, who were both at the Virtual Tribulation Realm, and help them build a divine kingdom.</p>

  <p>She herself didn't show up.</p>

  <p>A few years had passed, and Eddie was unable to get in touch with Marine Bai. She was so busy with various matters within the secret sect that gradually she forgot about this matter.</p>

  <p>One day, Master Wallace suddenly told Marine Bai that Luo Zheng had appeared and that he would personally go to the Sky Northern Region to kill him.</p>

  <p>Marine Bai suddenly got curious. Two years ago, Luo Zheng was just a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm. Was it worth it for a man at the Soul Sea Realm like Master Wallace to personally deal with such a nobody? Were Eddie and Simon that inept that they were unable to kill him?</p>

  <p>But Master Wallace told her that not only had Luo Zheng defeated his soul in the Spirit Container, but he had also killed Eddie, who was at the Life and Death Realm.</p>

  <p>Even in the divine kingdoms where talents ran rampant, no one was that strong and talented. From the Illuminating Soul Realm to the Virtual Tribulation Realm, Luo Zheng just took two years. He even killed a warrior at the fourth-grade of the Life and Death Realm! When, and how, did such a talent appear in the Sky Northern Region?</p>

  <p>Even if Marine Bai was the Holy Maiden of the York Divine Kingdom, it would still be difficult for her to command a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm. However, since Master Wallace was willing to kill Luo Zheng, she had agreed to him doing it without any hesitation. It was also at this time that she started to pay attention to Luo Zheng again.</p>

  <p>She felt that it was strange as to why Master Wallace, a person who would always do something profitable, was interested in someone like Luo Zheng. There must be some secret about Luo Zheng that had attracted Master Wallace's attention.</p>

  <p>No matter what, a warrior at the Soul Sea Realm was almost invincible in the Sky Northern Region. An ant like Luo Zheng would never be able to escape death. Marine Bai was one hundred percent sure he would definitely die.</p>

  <p>Not long after, a message suddenly came from the York Divine Kingdom that Master Wallace's life token had suddenly broken into pieces. Master Abraham's life token had also broken into pieces.</p>

  <p>There were more than twenty warriors at the Soul Sea Realm in the York Divine Kingdom. Although the four divine kingdoms competed with each other, their overall relationship was not bad. Under normal circumstances, very few warriors at the Soul Sea Realm would die, unless they were at the end of their lifespan, or they went to explore some mysterious ocean where there were many dangers.</p>

  <p>The fall of these two powerful warriors in the Sky Northern Region had shocked the entire York Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>To the four divine kingdoms, the Sky Northern Region was just a savage land. How could two warriors at the Soul Sea Realm be slaughtered in a place like that?</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be easy even for a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm to kill another warrior at the Soul Sea Realm. Neither Master Wallace nor Master Abraham sent back a single word before their life tokens broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>The sudden extermination of the two mighty warriors threw the whole upper echelon of the York Divine Kingdom in chaos. Despite that, they still hadn't made any moves yet. If something really happened in the Sky Northern Region, they probably wouldn't be able to investigate even if they sent another two warriors at the Soul Sea Realm there.</p>

  <p>As a result, they kept the deaths of the two warriors as a secret from the civilians. They planned on first exploring the Feather Holy Sea before thinking about how to deal with it. The storms above the Chaotic Ocean of Stars would calm down every once in a few years, and when the storms subsided next time, it wouldn't be too late to form a team of warriors at the Soul Sea Realm to explore the Sky Northern Region. If some powerful warriors had really appeared there, then they could just annihilate all the living beings in the entire region.</p>

  <p>Although Marine Bai still wanted to kill Luo Zheng, the lives of two warriors at the Soul Sea Realm that had been shockingly taken were more important.</p>

  <p id="top_2">She couldn't just send more people to the Sky Northern Region, and so she could only wait for the day to finally get rid of him.</p>
