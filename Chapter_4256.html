<br/><br/>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Based on appearance alone, there was nothing special about the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>It just looked like a piece of old wood with a frail-looking bottom side and a slightly thick top side. The crown at its top was messily spread out, making it appear a bit bloated and peculiar. All in all, it gave a mysterious impression, like a delicate artwork.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian stretched out his huge hand, which was several times bigger than before, and attempted to pull the Heavenly Ring Staff from the purple crystal.</p>

  <p>However, he failed to remove it with his brute force. Actually, he couldn't put too much pressure on the staff because he was afraid that he might break it.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian then threw a few more punches at the purple crystal, where the lower part of the staff was buried. A few moments after, the crystal was finally smashed to pieces, allowing him to completely acquire the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>As he stared upon the staff in his hands, he couldn't help but blurt out,</p>

  <p>"Does this thing really have the ability to reverse the grim situation that we're facing?"</p>

  <p>He inspected the staff some more and then injected a wisp of consciousness into it. As soon as it entered the staff, it just vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>"It's useless, huh?"</p>

  <p>Luo Nian was quite surprised upon seeing it. After thinking for a while, he decided to grab the Heavenly Ring Staff and walked towards the door. He saw that the little girl was still there and standing silently.</p>

  <p>Once the Heavenly Ring Staff was taken away, the Levitation Tower had already served its purpose and would lose its meaning of existence. It also meant that the little girl would disappear over time, though no one knew how much time would elapse before that happened.</p>

  <p>"Hey, do you know how to use the Heavenly Ring Staff?" Luo Nian thought of asking the little girl.</p>

  <p>But as usual, the little girl just shook her head and said, "I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Tch. You know nothing?"</p>

  <p>However, Luo Nian's primary goal was only to take the Heavenly Ring Staff to Luo Zheng. So, it wasn't really that urgent for him to find an answer on how to use it. "Then, how can I leave this place?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>This time, before the little girl could shake her head and tell him that she didn't know, a great force of attraction suddenly rushed out from the staff, extracting a small portion of power from Luo Nian's body.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A ray of purple light hovered around the Heavenly Ring Staff and directly shot towards the ceiling of the Levitation Tower's top floor.</p>

  <p>The moment that the beam of purple light hit the ceiling, it suddenly transformed into something inconceivable.</p>

  <p>Earlier, when the different races of the Deep Space, which were at the bottom of the tower, had witnessed that the green light had climbed up to the top floor, they got restless. However, soon after, they saw that the green light suddenly disappeared. Normally, when this light was extinguished, it meant that the creature bearing it had died.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, most of the members of the Deep Space races let out loud cheers. They thought that if they couldn't get the Heavenly Ring Staff, then they hoped that the Elemental race couldn't obtain it either.</p>

  <p>However, among all these savage creatures, a small portion of them was actually disappointed. These creatures didn't want to die in the Levitation Tower. If someone was able to acquire the Heavenly Ring Staff, then it meant that their cruel situation would be over.</p>

  <p>It had been a while since the green light was extinguished, and then a ray of purple light suddenly appeared. The top of the Levitation Tower, which originally looked like a chimney, began spreading out. It transformed into a flower-like object that bloomed and expanded in all directions. From it, a burly figure eventually emerged.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Nian noticed that all the lines on the huge square turned into green.</p>

  <p>He looked at the green lines and wondered if it meant that the restrictions on the square had been lifted already.</p>

  <p>While pondering on this thought, he jumped from the top of the tower.</p>

  <p>After floating in the air for a while, he accurately landed at the door of the oval-shaped building on the far right of the tower.</p>

  <p>At that time, the little monster from the Elemental race was also standing at the door of the building. So, when Luo Nian suddenly landed, the monster was instantly stunned as Luo Nian appeared in front of him. For a brief moment, he was in a daze. When he came to his senses, the little monster muttered some indistinguishable words, then bent over and bowed before Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you don't need to do this." Luo Nian was slightly taken aback by the little monster's sudden actions.</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but think that these Deep Space races were indeed simple-minded.</p>

  <p>In fact, Elder Xue had persevered in teaching them a lot of things.</p>

  <p>However, they still held their beliefs and traditions that the primitive tribes followed. With that, Elder Xue had no choice but to disguise himself as their god, because this was the only way that he could properly and effectively command the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>When the members of the different races from the Deep Space saw Luo Nian with the legendary staff in his hand, their stares immediately turned nasty. It was as if they were ready to pounce on him any time.</p>

  <p>When they found out that the restrictions on the huge square were already lifted, they rushed towards Luo Nian without any hesitation.</p>

  <p>They came from all directions while letting out wild screams and roars.</p>

  <p>"Waah! Waah!"</p>

  <p>"Goo! Goo! Goo!"</p>

  <p>"Grrr! Grrr! Grrr!"</p>

  <p>They let out a series of roars, but Luo Nian couldn't understand a single word they were saying. He thought that Elder Xue was so amazing, because he was perhaps the only one who had grasped the languages of all the six large races in the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>While he couldn't comprehend the words that they were shouting, Luo Nian could roughly guess what was running in their minds and what they were trying to say.</p>

  <p>It must have been some nonsense like "hand over the Heavenly Ring Staff, or we'll kill you". He was pretty sure of that because he could see it on their angry faces.</p>

  <p>Upon seeing this, the little monster uttered something and actually stood in front of Luo Nian with a dreadful look on his face. Even in front of all those creatures that were rushing towards them, he was hell-bent on protecting Luo Nian at all costs. However, while Luo Nian deeply appreciated the thought, he stretched out his huge hand, lifted the little monster, and put him aside.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. A lot has changed since I entered the Deep Space. You don't need to protect me anymore."</p>

  <p>When Luo Nian obtained the soul power as a reward, he was extremely thrilled. Through that, he had attained a massive boost in his strength, but his physical body was still weak. Now, his physical body had become terrifyingly strong. With his every move, he could feel an enormous force surging from within his body. He actually couldn't wait to test out his newly-acquired strength.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Nian then swiftly waved the Heavenly Ring Staff and pointed it at the members of the Deep Space races.</p>

  <p>As the creatures continued dashing towards Luo Nian, the three Cold Apes were the first ones to launch their attacks through their agile movements.</p>

  <p>Although these creatures possessed low intelligence, their strength, bloodlust, and experience in battle couldn't be underestimated. Since they were natives of the Deep Space, it could be said that their physical talent was still far greater than that of the creatures of the main world and the chaos.</p>

  <p>However, strictly speaking, Luo Nian was now a member of the Fostering race? not only an ordinary one, but actually a top master.</p>

  <p>Although the movements of the Cold Apes were too fast to be tracked by ordinary warriors, before Luo Nian's eyes, they were extremely slow.</p>

  <p>He lifted the Heavenly Ring Staff, and rushed towards the Cold Apes.</p>

  <p>Crash! Boom!</p>

  <p>With a tremendous gap in speed and strength, Luo Nian didn't even need to use any special skill to bring down his opponents.</p>

  <p>The fight had ended even before the Cold Apes realized what had happened. They didn't know what hit them, but they just felt very dizzy as if their world was spinning furiously. They also felt a severe pain on their backs as if a massive force smashed them. Consequently, they immediately fell on the ground, unable to move even an inch.</p>

  <p>All of the other creatures who witnessed this immediately stopped on their tracks.</p>

  <p>The truth was Luo Nian even held back most of his strength in fear that he might damage the Heavenly Ring Staff. If he didn't hold back, there was no way that these Cold Apes lying on the ground were still alive.</p>

  <p>"I know you're not stupid enough to court death upon seeing what I could do, right?" Luo Nian glared at the creatures in front of him as he said this.</p>

  <p>They might not understand what he exactly said, but he knew that through his actions, he was able to clearly relay his message.</p>

  <p>When every member of these races saw the pitiful state of the mighty Cold Apes, they eventually stepped back and lost their resolve to fight.</p>

  <p>Just from the look in Luo Nian's eyes, they could sense an intimidating aura that would crush them the moment that they dared to go against him.</p>

  <p>"Let's go! We're finished here."</p>

  <p>Luo Nian turned around and threw the little monster on his back. With a huge leap, he instantly flew out of the square.</p>

  <p>After passing the periphery of the huge square, Luo Nian looked into the distance and discovered that he was currently at the center of the Sky Wheel City.</p>

  <p>Previously, the spiders had carried him from the underground space all the way up to the spiral stairs.</p>

  <p>"Purr! Purr!"</p>

  <p>The little monster made some excited sounds as he pointed at a particular direction from Luo Nian's back.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Nian couldn't smoothly communicate with him, he kind of knew that he was pointing to the direction of the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>After flying quite a distance towards the southwestern part of the Sky Wheel City, Luo Nian observed that there were huge chunks of strata floating in the sky, each of which was about a hundred miles in diameter.</p>

  <p>He concluded that these giant strata must have been a part of a huge continent before.</p>

  <p>With the guidance from the little monster, Luo Nian flew towards one of the floating giant strata.</p>

  <p>However, even before he could get close, the little monster let out successive shrieks. Alarmed by the reaction of the little monster, Luo Nian looked around and quickly saw that there were black smoke pillars rising at the center of the massive stratum.</p>
