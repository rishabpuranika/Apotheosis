</p>

  <p>Bill's eyes scanned the Killing Zone before he pointed at the distance.</p>

  <p>In turn, Clifford's and Ivan's eyes flickered with a unique light.</p>

  <p>Then they had a panoramic view of the Killing Zone inside the tree trunk.</p>

  <p>Even if Bill didn't pinpoint exactly who, they were still able to spot Zheng quickly.</p>

  <p>"A low-rank True God?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't hard to differentiate Zheng from the numerous True Gods, since he was the only one with the lowest cultivation level among them.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, yes you are right." Bill gently smiled.</p>

  <p>For a long time, both Clifford and Ivan only watched Zheng on the battlefield.</p>

  <p>His body moved as if it was one with the wind. Every time the black beetles got close to him, the light of his fist flashed brightly and the black beetles were easily smashed like delicate shells.</p>

  <p>"This young man's strength is not bad," Clifford praised. "He's an outstanding low-rank True God and must be one of the top disciples of the powerful clans," Ivan said simply.</p>

  <p>Any other clan would've been surprised to see a low-rank True God like Zheng in the Killing Zone. Clifford and Ivan, however, weren't just from any other clan.</p>

  <p>They were from the Sword Clan, the second-ranked clan among the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Thus, they were no strangers to all kinds of talents.</p>

  <p>A smile stretched across Bill's lips. "Is he on the level of a top disciple from a powerful clan? Does our clan have any low-rank True God that can defeat him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think some of our low-rank True Gods are any weaker than him,"</p>

  <p>Ivan said proudly.</p>

  <p>Clifford observed the fight for a while and shook his head. "I don't agree.</p>

  <p>This guy apparently has suppressed his ability. Our low-rank True Gods may not be on par with him," he commented.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha!" Bill laughed upon hearing both of their words.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who he is?" he asked with a mysterious look.</p>

  <p>In turn, Clifford suddenly became extra curious. "Who is he?" "If I'm not mistaken, the skeleton of Mikail is still in his hands," Bill said with a trace of sadness that faintly weighed his face down.</p>

  <p>It was known that the seven elders of the Sword Clan were second only to their clan's Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings, and they all enjoyed a healthy relationship with one another.</p>

  <p>Therefore, they considered it a great loss if one of them died.</p>

  <p>Both Clifford and Ivan were immersed in their thoughts after they heard what Bill said.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Ivan's eyes lit up in realization as he said, "He's  Zheng Luo!"</p>

  <p>"The anonymous man in the Arena of Legends!" Clifford exclaimed as well. Bill just flashed them another gentle smile.</p>

  <p>"Continue watching. The situation is more complicated than you have imagined."</p>

  <p>"Complicated?" Clifford and Ivan asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>Although the Sword Clan and Zheng weren't exactly on bad terms, the clan knew Zheng very well because of Mikail's death.</p>

  <p>That was a matter that the clan still had to investigate.</p>

  <p>They knew that Zheng was unusually powerful and that he had taken the jade seal from the Time Sea Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>Still, they didn't know what Bill meant by "complicated."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng didn't know that three consummate True Gods from the Sword Clan were watching him. He was surrounded again.</p>

  <p>After all, he was an easier target because he couldn't fly, unlike the top-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>In addition, another wave of black beetles quickly replaced the ones who were smashed into bits.</p>

  <p>The black beetles decided to fight to their last breaths after such an aggravating outcome. Not long after, an even larger number of black beetles chased after Zheng.</p>

  <p>All the other True Gods who saw what happened scrambled to get away.</p>

  <p>They didn't know why Zheng attracted so many black beetles.</p>

  <p>"My goodness! He's going to be seized to death!" Clifford shouted.</p>

  <p>A slight frown tugged at the corners of Ivan's lips. Since Mikail's skeleton was still in Zheng's hands, they clearly couldn't let him die.</p>

  <p>If he did die, however…</p>

  <p>The jade seal would fall into the hands of the Sword Clan!</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan had always despised doing such things, but if Zheng were to die accidentally, the situation would be different.</p>

  <p>After all, the Sword Clan couldn't just ignore a supreme treasure of belief like the jade seal.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe he still doesn't want to crush the Sword Card," Ivan said in disbelief. He saw that Zheng's body had floated, but the young warrior in the Killing Zone didn't have the slightest intention of giving up.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Bill still looked quite relaxed. "You'll know if you continue to see it!" he chimed.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, something strange occurred.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body began to transform into a vague figure.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, his body emitted a strange aura.</p>

  <p>Under the influence of that aura, he twisted around and jumped out of the swarm of black beetles in a rather peculiar manner.</p>

  <p>Clifford's and Ivan's jaws dropped in shock.</p>

  <p>"What?!"</p>

  <p>Of course, they clearly felt Zheng's special aura.</p>

  <p>They were consummate True Gods who could sense even the smallest auras just like what Zheng released, unlike ordinary True Gods.</p>

  <p>"That aura he unleashed… Is it some kind of a Truth of Godly Way?"</p>

  <p>Clifford asked, although he was unsure. However, Bill nodded and stroked his beard pensively.</p>

  <p>"Yes! If my eyes serve me right, it is the Truth of Cultivation Nature. The Twelve Abridged Truths of Godly Ways has a simple record of it.</p>

  <p>According to the book, it is very much like..."</p>

  <p>The Twelve Abridged Truths of Godly Ways was a work of an old master of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>It was a collection of what the Sword Clan had accumulated in the debates over the Godly Ways over the past years, and the summary of the twelve kinds of Truth of Godly Way that had been discovered in the divine land.</p>

  <p>But since they were abridged, it meant that they were incomplete. The explanations written inside it were mostly just speculations, but to be fair, it wasn't easy to summarize the twelve kinds of Truth of Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"The Truth of Cultivation Nature..." Clifford muttered. "I wonder what level he is in now. Since he came here to take part in the debate, will this debate really turn out like what you said before?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, almost." Bill nodded, then continued, "It's time to unveil this debate."</p>

  <p>"Alas… For so many years, many True Gods in the divine land have already been accustomed to such a peaceful and stable life. Sometimes, I really hope that this kind of life can continue!" Clifford sighed wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Dream on! If we can't think of a way, the ship will sink sooner or later.</p>

  <p>Then, we will die together!" Ivan chuckled coldly.</p>

  <p>"I know. I just haven't accepted it. If the Mountain of Holy Beings descends next time, I still have the chance to become a Holy Being!" Clifford lamented with regret.</p>

  <p>"So many Demi-holy Beings are expecting the mountain. Even if it really comes, I'm afraid you won't be able to get a chance," Ivan sneered.</p>

  <p>"I'm not afraid of those Demi-holy Beings!" The two of them continued to bicker as they watched Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng had walked further into the Killing Zone in just a few seconds.</p>

  <p>He had passed the second stage, and now he had entered the third stage.</p>

  <p>Back in the first stage, about ten percent of the True Gods had quit by crumbing their Sword Cards.</p>

  <p>The number increased to fifty percent in the second stage. About four hundred top-rank True Gods died in the Killing Zone and became food for those black beetles.</p>

  <p>The Killing Zone was divided into only five stages.</p>

  <p>Ninety percent of the True Gods would be eliminated in the first four.</p>

  <p>Then, only three to five contenders would be really able to pass the fifth stage.</p>

  <p>As the fight progressed, Bill, Clifford, and Ivan were still in talks about whether Zheng could pass the test.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he kept moving forward under their watchful gazes. Six hours later, he finally stepped out of the Killing Zone.</p>
