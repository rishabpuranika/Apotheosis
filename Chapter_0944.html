<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing this response, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but be shocked. It was just as Luo Luo Zheng had guessed before? if the entire universe was inside some giant beast, then the masters in that universe would have to follow the world's rules, whether it was how to use or how not to use their life vitality, their forceful energy, and all kinds of Law Power.</p>

  <p>Would this mean that even they, the masters of the world themselves, would not be able to perceive the exit of this whole world?</p>

  <p>To learn the answer to this question was tempting, but now was not the time for them to think about such things. Their mission was to leave the Dark Nether Cave first, and that was what they were going to do.</p>

  <p>Time went by quickly.</p>

  <p>The fog in the entire Dark Nether Cave started to gradually dissipate. In the blink of an eye, a month had already passed.</p>

  <p>All of the top-level war lords of the Demon Night and the human race gathered on the top of the tower. They all looked upset and worried.</p>

  <p>Elder Mei waited by the exit of the Tower of Sin every day, but there was still no sign of Esther and the rest.</p>

  <p id="top_14">"It's already been a month. If Esther and the others still don't return, the Dark Nether Death Light will fill the entire Dark Nether Cave again!" a top-level war lord of the Demon Night said.</p>

  <p>Once the Dark Nether Death Light's intensity reached its full force once again, the warriors in the Dark Nether Cave would definitely die. It had been like that since the Tower of Sin opened its doors, and there had been no exceptions.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng might be fine..." a top-level human war lord muttered.</p>

  <p>In actuality, the person the war lords of the Demon Night and the human race cared about the most was Luo Luo Zheng, not Fabian or Esther.</p>

  <p>The reason why the Demon Night members were worried about Luo Zheng's condition was because Xun stayed closely with him. They did not want the queen of the Demon Night to perish in the Dark Nether Cave like this. As an extra level of precaution, Elder Mei had sent his race members back to the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place to check the queen statue of the Demon Night. As the statue was still glowing with a faint red light, which meant that Xun was still alive and well, Luo Luo Zheng might also still be alive!</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the humans were concerned about Luo Luo Zheng for a very simple reason? Luo Luo Zheng was currently the controller of the Tower of Sin. If he died, it would be easy for the ogres to come back to the tower. Even the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place wouldn't have a good excuse to stop them from going back!</p>

  <p>If that time ever came, the seats at the top of the tower delegated to the human race would undoubtedly be taken away, and all the humans in the Tower of Sin would be expelled. It wouldn't matter which kind of war lord they were? weak, ordinary, or high-ranking, and every human being would be expelled from the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>It was something that humans would never want to see. They'd rather die than let that happen.</p>

  <p>Another dangerous repercussion of Luo Zheng's death, if that were to happen, was that Xun, the queen of the Demon Night, Luo Zheng's sword spirit, would also disappear, much like a wisp of smoke. If that happened, the Purple Heart Sacred Place would lose the protection of the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place. Now, if that happened and the Purple Heart Sacred Place was forced to fight against the two ogre sacred places, its only outcome would be the Purple Heart Sacred Place being totally destroyed by the ogres. And if that happened, the human race would be gone for good.</p>

  <p>Because of this, many human beings began blaming Luo Luo Zheng for the uncertainty they were feeling. Despite understanding that without his appearance, the human race would still be at the brink of death and that he had brought their race temporary glory, they couldn't understand how it could all be taken away just like that. He gave the Purple Heart Sacred Place a glimmer of hope, but if that hope would be destroyed in less than a year, how could they be so willing to accept it?</p>

  <p>Apart from the humans and the Demon Night, the other races were still maintaining a neutral attitude towards this whole debacle. However, the top-level war lords of the Night Group were secretly rejoicing. As the time of the closing of the entrance at the top of tower slowly approached, the probability of Luo Zheng's death in the Dark Nether Cave also increased.</p>

  <p>The Night Group members continuously sent this information to the two ogre sacred places.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the top-level ogre war lords in the two ogre sacred places were already getting ready to re-enter the sacred place's transmission array.</p>

  <p>They were also getting ready to head towards the Tower of Sin. And as soon as the entrance at top of the tower closed, they would begin to drive the human warriors out of the tower.</p>

  <p>Several days later, the red dot at the center of the Dark Nether Cave suddenly became flared up, and became a thousand times brighter than before!</p>

  <p>The weaker creatures that were lurking around started spreading out in all directions. Those weak monsters would not be able to resist the power of the Dark Nether Death Light and would only be able to move around the edges of the Dark Nether Cave. Only the truly powerful monsters could live in the inner layer of the Dark Nether Cave! The core area, on the other hand, was completely devoid of monsters. Except for the Heavenly Immortal Root, none of the other monsters would be able to survive there!</p>

  <p>The moment someone stepped into the Fog Array, they would be slowly pulled towards the abyss. No creature could get close and resist the Dark Nether Death Light.</p>

  <p>"Close!"</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>On Elder Mei's order, the entrance at the top of the Tower of Sin finally closed.</p>

  <p>Although there were news from the Heavenly Feather Sacred Place that Xun's statue was still flashing with a faint red light, Elder Mei did not believe that Luo Luo Zheng and his fellows would be able to return. After all, after the Dark Nether Death Light had already recovered, no one would be able to return from the Dark Nether Cave any longer.</p>

  <p>Because of this, the majority of the warriors had concluded that Esther had also perished in the cave. Esther's death would surely be a great loss to the Demon Night. After all, she was the strongest master among the seat owners. Without Esther to take charge of the situation, it would be difficult for the Demon Night members to fight against Maurice of the ogre.</p>

  <p>If Maurice returned to the Tower of Sin right now, the Demon Night would be in a very sticky situation.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's over. It's all over!" a top-level human war lord screamed with a sullen face. "Death is already knocking on our doors! Someone helps us!"</p>

  <p>All top-level human war lords looked scared and disappointed. Among the humans, only Fabian and Jarrod were in charge of the overall situation. The other warriors who held seats in the tower simply couldn't be in charge of anything as they weren't that powerful and remarkable. Most of the top-level war lords didn't even have the qualifications to become seat owners before, and they only passed the time on the fourteenth floor of the Tower of Sin!</p>
