<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 463 The Cheating (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>However, the swordsman who entered the Killing Sword Mountain was able to store his malicious Mu Ning in it! In this way, he could avoid the damage caused by the malicious Mu Ning, which was the main purpose of the Killing Sword Mountain. It was also the reason why the Killing Sword Mountain was considered a sacred place for swordsmen.</p>

  <p>The lucky swordsman, who inserted his sword into a place of high altitude, could deposit and withdraw more malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>This was Luo Zheng's first time at the Killing Sword Mountain. To be able to enter Killing Sword Mountain was already a matter of great luck for him.</p>

  <p>It was unknown whether he would be able to enter the Killing Sword Mountain again. Maybe a person only got one opportunity to access the mountain. It was possible that even after making a huge breakthrough, Luo Luo Zheng might not be able to enter the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>Just like the Iceni, an ice sword master, perhaps his strength was now very strong, and according to general knowledge, he was supposed to insert his sacred weapon higher than on the edge of the ridge. However, he did not get the chance to enter the Killing Sword Mountain, so his sacred weapon could only be firmly inserted on the edge of the ridge, without any higher improvement.</p>

  <p>So this time, Luo Luo Zheng was determined to insert his sword in a higher place.</p>

  <p>When attacked by the spirit of the sacred weapon, Luo Luo Zheng did not reserve his strength. He exercised his highest martial arts and top-grade weapon.</p>

  <p>The people who owned sacred weapons were influential enough to rule a region. According to Luo Luo Zheng, Iceni might have had strength equivalent to that of people like the top leader of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Even if the sacred weapon contained the sword spirit and only a little of Iceni's spirit, it would be difficult for Luo Luo Zheng to defeat him even after employing all his skills.</p>

  <p>"Ice Freeze All! Just watch me freeze you!" Iceni's spirit said arrogantly.</p>

  <p>Then, he summoned the sword spirit to attack Luo Luo Zheng. As soon as the sword attack was launched, Luo Luo Zheng felt cold. Even his consciousness seemed to be freezing. His surrounding space was filled with a chill, and he could see ice crystals forming.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not afraid of fire and heat as his body could resist different kinds of flames. However, there was no way for him to deal with the cold. As he was surrounded by such extreme cold, his speed was significantly reduced, and he had no way to fight harder.</p>

  <p>"Lift up the sword!" Luo Luo Zheng said quickly.</p>

  <p>With his sword lifted, soon, the malicious Mu Ning of his sword spirit, Lily was released.</p>

  <p>That malicious Mu Ning turned into pieces of silk thread and split the ice crystals in an instant!</p>

  <p>With the help of the malicious Mu Ning, Luo Zheng's sword broke Iceni's cold attack.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible! Your malicious Mu Ning can't be so strong!" Iceni's spirit said, startled. Since Iceni was able to step into Killing Sword Mountain and he also practiced killing swordplay, he had a thorough understanding of the malicious Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>The malicious Mu Ning in Luo Zheng's body was not strong at all, but the malicious Mu Ning in his sword was powerful.</p>

  <p>What Iceni didn't know was that Luo Zheng's sword spirit had just been condensed and that the malicious Mu Ning was not Luo Zheng's, but from his sword spirit, Lily.</p>

  <p>"Poof!"</p>

  <p>"Snap, snap, snap..." the sound of something breaking echoed across the mountain.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng broke Iceni's extreme cold attack, he lunged his sword toward Iceni's spirit. The sound of shattering glass reverberated through the mountain as Iceni's spirit had been pierced by the sword.</p>

  <p>Soon afterward, the sacred weapon returned to its original place, and a large number of blue light spots gushed out of the sacred weapon and flew into Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>"This killing Mu Ning, or malicious Mu Ning, is so powerful! No wonder the woman from the Demon Night could carry a low-grade mysterious weapon up the mountainside," Luo Luo Zheng muttered in excitement. He now finally understood that she could insert such a low-grade mysterious weapon in the mountainside because she relied on her extraordinarily strong malicious Mu Ning!</p>

  <p>"If that is so, then the Killing Sword Mountain will be beneficial to me.</p>

  <p>Should I insert my sword in it now?" Luo Luo Zheng mumbled as he thought of the possibilities. Since he had defeated Iceni's spirit, Luo Luo Zheng now crossed over the mountainside and stood on the ridge, a level higher than before.</p>

  <p>He looked up and found that although there were not many sacred weapons, as compared to the number of fairy weapons, the number of sacred weapons in front of him was enough to make him skeptical. Since Iceni's sword spirit, hidden in the first sacred weapon he encountered, was so powerful, it was not hard to imagine how much stronger the sword spirits from other sacred weapons would be.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, I think today's progress is enough. It is truly amazing that you were able to reach the ridge. The Killing Sword Mountain is filled with countless talents, and the master of every sword you see is a talented swordsman. These masters have figured out the sword intent at the consummation grade. You only have the strength of a cultivator at the second grade of the nature level. Now, you are able to break through these barriers and insert your fairy weapon alongside these sacred weapons. This is an outstanding achievement," the cyan dragon said slowly. "Equally, I am afraid that you won't be able to defeat the next sword no matter how hard you try."</p>

  <p>A sacred weapon not far from Luo Luo Zheng flashed a golden light. It was a broad-edge sword that was wider than Luo Zheng's body and over seven feet long. To be able to handle such a sword, the master must be a colossus. What stressed Luo Luo Zheng more was that on the surface of the broad-edge sword, there was still a hint of reddish energy. If Luo Luo Zheng guessed correctly, that energy would be malicious Mu Ning that had been compressed to an extreme extent.</p>

  <p>Even a simple glimpse of the sword was terrifying to Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was self-aware. He knew that with his current strength and the malicious Mu Ning of his sword spirit, he was able to defeat Iceni's sword spirit, and to walk up the ridge. Indeed, this was a good result and perhaps, the best he could do at the moment.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng did not seem to be ready to stop at this point.</p>

  <p>He took two steps back and gripped the Streamer Sword firmly. Then, with a deep breath, he sprinted forward.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, oh, my..." the cyan dragon in Luo Zheng's mind said helplessly. He knew exactly what Luo Luo Zheng was planning on doing.</p>

  <p>Since he hadn't made a successful breakthrough, Luo Luo Zheng threw his sword forward hard.</p>
