  <p>
</p>

  <p>With his single eye closed shut, Holy Drew held the source of Godly Tile and entered a state of meditation.</p>

  <p>There were too many assumptions and conjectures regarding the source of Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Up until then, no one had been able to discover the true secrets within.</p>

  <p>The only thing people knew it could do was transform itself into all sorts of shapes and sizes.</p>

  <p>Back then, a Holy Being had obtained a huge source of Godly Tile about the height of a person. That Holy Being turned the source of Godly Tile into a hard spear? it had the solidity of a Godly Tile as its only advantage.</p>

  <p>And there were more treasures in the divine land apart from this. So even though the source of Godly Tile was a precious treasure in the eyes of the Holy Beings, it was still useless. No one had managed to grasp the correct usage of the item.</p>

  <p>Under Holy Drew's meditation, the surface of the Godly Tile began rippling.</p>

  <p>The crystal twisted continuously in Holy Drew's hand as if he was holding a constantly shifting drop of water.</p>

  <p>The man also had his own thoughts about the source of Godly Tile? he wanted to use it for the creation of a defensive magic treasure that could take form at will.</p>

  <p>"If this thing merges with your body, it will be able to transform into clothes or armor as you wish," Holy Drew said as he threw the Godly Tile towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The source of Godly Tile was like water as it splashed against Luo Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>The 'water' then flowed along his figure, being evenly distributed onto the surface of his skin, seeping into his flesh. Then, it turned into a transparent film that wrapped around Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"This time, it should be enough," Holy Drew said as he smiled and turned to look at the corner of the cave. "We can now officially begin."</p>

  <p>From a distance, Holy Jay nodded in agreement. It was the most critical and painful step? they were going to put Luo Luo Zheng through a thorough refinement.</p>

  <p>The door in the cave opened with a bang as Holy Drew dragged Luo Luo Zheng through it and disappeared.</p>

  <p>In the Evolutionary Universe</p>

  <p>After the conversation with the Celestial Position race ended, the entire Sacred race retreated, returning to the three supreme worlds on the edge of the Evolutionary Universe. These worlds were where the now perished Spring race once lived.</p>

  <p>Still, people were terrified.</p>

  <p>Perhaps many creatures of the lower levels had no knowledge of the Sacred race's purpose. But these people had come from another universe.</p>

  <p>In the end, they were still a great threat.</p>

  <p>In the past year or so, the Sacred race hadn't tried to expand, choosing to stay in three supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>But powerful energy fluctuations had come frequently from these worlds. Sometimes, it even caused violent spatial tremors. The warriors of the Wind Avoiding World could often feel such intense vibrations as they were closest to the three supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>Now, many of the soldiers were stationed within the Wind Avoiding World.</p>

  <p>The Celestial Position race, the Thoughtless Minds, the Humanity Alliance, and the Blessed Buddha Land each sent out a portion of their elites to guard the trans-border channel.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A powerful ripple of space quickly spread through the spatial channels.</p>

  <p>The universe's supreme world channels were connected to each other as they were usually constructed by grand world lords.</p>

  <p>After the Sacred race occupied the three supreme worlds, someone suggested they blow up the supreme world channels.</p>

  <p>The only way out of these worlds was the trans-border channel of the Wind Avoiding World, after all.</p>

  <p>But many of the Supreme Lords rejected the idea.</p>

  <p>The trans-border channel could only cause trouble for the warriors below a world lord's level. There was nearly no point in blowing up the channel as it risked enraging the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>Now, what was missing from the universe was time.</p>

  <p>Although the Celestial Position race had announced that they sent the ten Godly Geniuses out, many races and forces in the universe were still uncertain about the whole situation.</p>

  <p>A hundred years of cultivation was considered very short to a martial artist. When one reached the Spirit Transformation Realm, they could easily cultivate for over 10, 000 years. Every instance of cultivation could last over a thousand years, after all.</p>

  <p>Only when the Sacred Race had already attacked them did they send out the ten Godly Geniuses. What was the point?</p>

  <p>Were they counting on them to cultivate for two to three years before fighting back?</p>

  <p>It wasn't only a matter of the races lacking confidence? even Master Feng himself seemed to be worried.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, Tianming, Nathan?</p>

  <p>All these people had outstanding talents? they were super geniuses that came into being after the master of the universe had executed his plan.</p>

  <p>Though they were blessed with exceptional talent and a unique foundation, their cultivation was still too weak overall.</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land might have been an excellent place to cultivate, but it wasn't very realistic to hope that the Godly Geniuses could grow much stronger in a short span of time.</p>

  <p>If given a hundred years, the situation could have been much more optimistic.</p>

  <p>Who would've thought that just as the ten Godly Geniuses were selected, the war would already erupt in the universe before they could even get on the right track? Just as the sorcerer race's crisis was settled, the Sacred race had broken through the Sighing Wall and attacked them.</p>

  <p>The universe's lifespan was calculated in terms of hundreds of millions of years, but so much trouble had risen within a mere couple of years. So much danger had broken out in such a short time? clearly, they had extremely bad luck this time around.</p>

  <p>But Master Feng wasn't certain about Mike's plans. At this very moment, Luo Luo Zheng, Nathan, Tianming, Mu Ning, Xenia, and the others were undergoing astonishing transformations.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Another explosive sound rang out.</p>

  <p>In the supreme world channel of the Wind Avoiding World, many exquisite cyan ships floated around in space.</p>

  <p>Along with the explosion, a blazing white Space Law spiraled forward along the channel. In the blink of an eye, it struck the mast of a cyan ship? these ships were spatial treasures created by the Humanity Alliance that were used to guard the supreme world channel.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>And then, the mast on the cyan ship broke.</p>

  <p>Many human warriors then ran out to the ship's deck when they heard it.</p>

  <p>"It's getting more and more outrageous. What on earth are those guys doing?" A human martial artist sounded indignant.</p>

  <p>Almost all the stationed warriors were at the Spirit Supreme or Spirit Transformation Realm and among them, there were three world lords.</p>

  <p>In truth, these martial artists knew that no one was expecting them to be able to resist the Sacred race. Letting them stay there was only a deterrent to keep the Sacred race from spreading outward.</p>

  <p>It was an extremely dangerous situation. If the Sacred race was determined to invade the universe, their entire group would be swallowed up by the Sacred race like tiny shrimps.</p>

  <p>"No matter what they do, we'll just ignore it. The only thing we need to do now is make sure that we don't anger them," a warrior said, sounding helpless. "It's clear now that the Sacred race is very strong. If we're careless enough to provoke them, they could use it as a reason to put the entire universe in danger!"</p>

  <p>"You think being careless would provoke the Sacred race? You really know nothing about them. If the Sacred race wanted to start a war, they'd do it. Besides... Do they even need a reason to start a war?" another warrior said coldly.</p>

  <p>"That's right, the Sacred race needs no reason. They'll start a war as they please." And then another warrior agreed.</p>

  <p>On the deck, the people continued discussing the matter as they looked on to the depths of the trans-border channel. But the length of the channel was difficult to estimate. No one knew where the lightning from that space had come from.</p>

  <p>Then, they suddenly realized that the space around them began its violent fluctuations once again.</p>

  <p>"Look! What's that?!" a warrior shouted as he pointed to the front.</p>

  <p>Under the crowd's eyes, the trans-border channel in the distance was constantly collapsing at extreme speed. It rapidly spread towards the cyan ships stationed here.</p>

  <p>These trans-border channels were fairly stable spaces, usually maintained in turns by a few world lords of a supreme world.</p>

  <p>After maintenance, they could last for another several hundred or thousand years. Because of this, it was almost impossible for them to self-destruct.</p>

  <p>"Alert! Now!" Someone was shouting.</p>

  <p>Boom? Boom?</p>

  <p>The drums resounded rapidly on the cyan ships. As soon as everyone climbed up the deck, a giant mouth filled with fangs appeared before them. It seemed to cover the entirety of the supreme world channel as it began gnawing and devouring everything along it.</p>

  <p>"It's a World Devouring Beast!" A world lord standing on a ship stared ahead as he shouted.</p>

  <p>These beasts that lived in the void of space fed on space and supreme worlds. If the Sacred race used a World Devouring Beast, it was probably with the intention of starting an all-out war.</p>
