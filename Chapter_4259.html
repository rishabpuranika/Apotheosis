<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ziya was obviously confused. "What do you mean by 'a lot of things'?</p>

  <p>Can you please explain to me what happened?"</p>

  <p>It was a long story. Geoffrey thought for a moment. Ultimately, he said,</p>

  <p>"My father brought those human heroes to the Jade Pure Realm."</p>

  <p>Naturally, Ziya was taken aback. "What? They attacked the Element Spirit Civilization?"</p>

  <p>"No. Actually, they fought some people who were even stronger than the whole Element Spirit Civilization."</p>

  <p>Afterward, Geoffrey told Ziya everything he knew about what had happened in the Three Purities Stage.</p>

  <p>"So what you're saying is, my master... He is dead?" Ziya was thoroughly stunned by this news. It was like a wave of sadness suddenly washed over him.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey looked somber. "Yes. I've heard that the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others died. However, they left their souls behind."</p>

  <p>"Well, then what do we do now? Moreover, what's happened to you?"</p>

  <p>Ziya asked as he stared at Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Geoffrey's body had already expanded several times.</p>

  <p>Somehow, it made him look like a small giant. He emitted such a powerful and mysterious aura that it made Ziya a little scared. Even with Ziya's broad knowledge, it was still difficult for him to imagine what Geoffrey had experienced.</p>

  <p>"Now, this is actually related to the task assigned to me by the Human Spirit King. He asked me to go to the Deep Space..."</p>

  <p>So, Geoffrey told Ziya that he had explored the pillar. He went into the Deep Space to fetch the Heavenly Ring Staff.</p>

  <p>He proceeded to inform Ziya about the details of the matter. It alleviated Ziya's grief a little. At the same time, he also realized that the wooden staff in Geoffrey's hand was an extraordinary magical object.</p>

  <p>"You said that the Heavenly Ring Staff is omnipotent, right? Can you transform me into a creature of the Abstruse Energy World?" Ziya just had to ask if this was possible.</p>

  <p>Even though he studied the Abstruse Energy World for a long time, Ziya had never been able to fully explore it.</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll see... Let's give it a try, shall we? Maybe the Heavenly Ring Staff can perform the Soul Reincarnation."</p>

  <p>The Levitation Tower was capable of releasing the Soul Reincarnation.</p>

  <p>Thus, the Heavenly Ring Staff might be able to do the same.</p>

  <p>"What is the Soul Reincarnation?" This greatly piqued Ziya's curiosity.</p>

  <p>With that, a smile appeared on Geoffrey's face. "You'll know soon. Trust me."</p>

  <p>Soon enough, he felt like the Heavenly Ring Staff was drawing his strength.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, they heard a splashing sound.</p>

  <p>It released an invisible force to envelop Ziya.</p>

  <p>The next moment, Ziya was feeling sharp pain all over his body. It began to expand infinitely. The pain was almost unbearable.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, Geoffrey was worried about Ziya. He thought that maybe he wouldn't be able to tolerate the pain. After all, the Soul Reincarnation was pretty risky.</p>

  <p>On second thought, Ziya was much stronger than those savage races in the Deep Space even though he was a creature of the third-grade world. It shouldn't be difficult for him to undergo one Soul Reincarnation.</p>

  <p>The pain lasted for quite some time. Slowly, Ziya opened his eyes. He was in the secondary world. Therefore, he didn't notice any difference.</p>

  <p>"Wait, what is this? Did it really have to hurt like that?" Ziya asked as he tried to move his body.</p>

  <p>"Just follow me," Geoffrey replied with a smile on his face. He was right that Ziya could tolerate the process.</p>

  <p>When he saw Geoffrey walking out of the secondary world, he immediately picked up the rope on the ground. He was afraid to get lost in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Just as he stepped into the Abstruse Energy World, the dots of light everywhere suddenly disappeared. They were replaced by an open, complete, and huge world.</p>

  <p>"So this is what the Soul Reincarnation is..."</p>

  <p>"Yes. It helped you become a creature of the Abstruse Energy World. If your soul is strong enough, you can even become a creature of the Deep Space," Geoffrey responded.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Ziya was quite ecstatic now. After all, he had studied this world for countless eras. And now, he could finally move freely in it. He was like a child who just learned how to run freely.</p>

  <p>If he had enough time, Ziya was more than willing to stay in the Abstruse Energy World for a longer period of time.</p>

  <p>However, Geoffrey said that the situation in the chaos was very critical.</p>

  <p>They couldn't waste a single moment in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a lot of things were also happening in the chaos.</p>

  <p>In the Pear Hill, Elizabeth of the Sun Crow race looked rather bored. She had been staring at the distant blood-colored sky for quite some time now.</p>

  <p>She had successfully guided Pompeo in taking over the Blooming Jade Stage. Since then, she had rarely left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It was very interesting for her to manage the Blooming Jade Stage. After all, she was a predominating ruler there. No one dared to disobey her. So this made her feel like she once did when she was the head of the Divine Lair.</p>

  <p>However, she didn't expect that disaster would strike so suddenly. Those destructive energy balls could devour everything.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was able to escape the Other Shore to avoid the catastrophe.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Pompeo was not. This giant creature from the fourth-grade world could only watch the energy balls raining down.</p>

  <p>As soon as Elizabeth returned to the Blooming Jade Stage, she saw a huge crater. More than half of the Blooming Jade Stage had been devoured.</p>

  <p>Even the core of the Heavenly Obsession Civilization had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>She didn't have any choice. She couldn't stay on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Therefore, she decided to return to the Pear Hill and just watch the primitive land expand rapidly and grow even stronger.</p>

  <p>The primitive land expanded really fast. It exceeded everyone's expectations. Even Zheng didn't foresee that it would develop this quickly.</p>

  <p>The larger the size of the primitive land was, the faster it would devour the heads. Its expansion speed increased exponentially.</p>

  <p>Compared to the primitive land, the once enormous Pear Hill was like a lonely sailboat on the vast ocean.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng was sitting cross legged with his eyes closed on the jadeite platform. He was trying to assess the chaos from the perspective of the primitive land.</p>

  <p>"The Source World is not getting any closer. It's actually beginning to move towards the exact opposite direction," Zheng stated. His eyes remained closed.</p>

  <p>When they heard this news, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the Chaos Ancient Gods felt thoroughly relieved.</p>

  <p>A few days ago, the Source World suddenly appeared. Naturally, it made everyone nervous.</p>

  <p>They knew the Evil God too well. He was much too difficult to deal with.</p>

  <p>If he decided to target them, they would undoubtedly encounter a huge trouble. They would be seriously injured, if not dead.</p>

  <p>The primitive land was not how it used to be. It had expanded even larger than the developed Source World. Nevertheless, this was not the right time to fight.</p>

  <p>Everyone was starting to relax when Zheng continued, "The Source World released a flying ship."</p>

  <p>The flying ship was the size of a grain of sand compared to the current Source World. Yet, Zheng's keen eyes noticed it immediately.</p>

  <p>"What? A flying ship?" The Snake Goddess looked at Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Allow me to intercept it," said Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"We can nevet let the Evil God step foot on the primitive land. Otherwise, we will have a huge problem!"</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Kendrick, and Gerald wanted to make a move.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng shook his head. "You don't need to do anything. My incarnation can now leave the primitive land by will. I'll be the one to go," he said.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter what the Evil God was planning to do. At most, Zheng would only lose an incarnation. This was the safest plan. Realizing that, Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and the others no longer insisted.</p>

  <p>After they settled on the plan, Zheng summoned an incarnation to appear on the Pear Hill.</p>

  <p>The next moment, his incarnation appeared outside the primitive land on a flying ship. It merely floated in the empty chaos.</p>

  <p>The distance between the Source World and the primitive land seemed really close. But in reality, they were quite far away from each other. It would take the two flying ships two days of travelling at a great speed before they met.</p>

  <p>But still, they were slowly getting closer.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood on the flying ship and peered into the other one. The enchanted barrier at the top of the ship opened, and a black figure shot out of it and floated in the void. He looked at Zheng and laughed wildly. It was none other than the Evil God.</p>
