<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1315 Riyad </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once her song was finished, the woman giggled and asked, "Am I a good singer?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely!"</p>

  <p>"It's such a wonderful song that belongs to the Heavens!"</p>

  <p>"I've never heard such a beautiful song before."</p>

  <p>It made their hearts ache to use their precious Roaring Tokens to praise this unknown woman, but the Supreme Lords had no choice.</p>

  <p>She might sound young, but she was someone none of them could afford to offend. Her displeasure might spell doom for the entire universe, after all.</p>

  <p>The woman snorted, "I'm not asking you guys! I'm asking him!"</p>

  <p>It was clearly obvious who she was referring to.</p>

  <p>Noticing that the young man who had counted for so long earlier had gotten silent, the Supreme Lords scrambled to get him speaking once again. "Say something boy!"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled to himself in his cave. He activated the Roaring Token in his hand and praised, "You're a good singer."</p>

  <p>"Really?" she exclaimed. "Then can I sing to you every day?"</p>

  <p>Her voice was incredibly lovely but all the Supreme Lords would die of stress if she sang every day. How could they ever enjoy such good singing if the threat of a horrifying beast attack hung on her every note?</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, it was not their place to deny her of her wishes. They couldn't afford to offend her though they wished Luo Luo Zheng would reject this offer of hers.</p>

  <p>"Okay," Luo Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Great! By the way, I don't know your name. How should I address you in the future?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>This immediately piqued the interest of the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>A name would greatly narrow down their options in finding this young man. These two fellows were incredibly interesting, and they all wanted to know just where they got their Roaring Tokens from and how they hadn't used them up yet.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng was no idiot. There was no way he was going to announce his name to the entire universe after scolding two Supreme Lords. His special Roaring Token would also be at risk if his identity was ever exposed.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, but it's a secret," he said.</p>

  <p>"What a pity!" she replied in a dejected voice. There was a collective intake of breath as the Supreme Lords all thought that Luo Zheng's reply had offended her, but the woman quickly spoke again. "It doesn't matter, as long as you can chat with me. I'm trapped here and I can't go anywhere so I'm really bored."</p>

  <p>"If I have the time, I'd be happy to chat with you," Luo Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>He wasn't really interested in talking with her. He already had a lot on his plate so he didn't think he'd have the time to chat with an unknown woman from God knew where.</p>

  <p>He only said that to make her happy.</p>

  <p>Finishing the conversation, Luo Luo Zheng put away his Roaring Token and chose to cultivate in solitude for several hours.</p>

  <p>The next day, Luo Luo Zheng returned to the gathering place and found it abuzz with discussions regarding the Roaring Token matter that happened yesterday.</p>

  <p>"Who do you think that mysterious young man is?"</p>

  <p>"I think he's the descendant of some Supreme Lord."</p>

  <p>"Me too. Only a Supreme Lord's descendant would be so willful when it comes to using Roaring Tokens."</p>

  <p>One of the armored men who heard the conversation sneered, "Stop talking nonsense! Not even a Supreme Lord would be willing to waste Roaring Tokens like that, let alone his descendant. That young man's background isn't something you guys can even speculate!"</p>

  <p>"Wait! If he's not some Supreme Lord's descendant, then who is he?" a warrior asked.</p>

  <p>The armored man asked in reply, "How should I know? But I'm pretty sure he's not the descendant of some Supreme Lord. There are too many people in this universe. Nobody can ever really know who he is."</p>

  <p>He was wrong though.</p>

  <p>There were people who knew this mysterious man's identity since they recognized Luo Zheng's voice.</p>

  <p>Yolande and the warriors from the Celestial Position race were those who knew of his identity.</p>

  <p>However, the Celestial Position warriors weren't too sure. Like the armored man had said, there were too many people in the universe and there might be someone with a voice similar to Luo Zheng's. They could only guess that it was him.</p>

  <p>Yolande, however, was sure of his identity. She knew about Yan and the fact that Luo Luo Zheng was also looking for this sister of his. There was no doubt that Luo Luo Zheng was the owner of the voice they all heard yesterday.</p>

  <p>There was no way a random person with the same voice as Luo Zheng's would start looking for someone named "Yan." Coincidence was never just coincidence.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, meanwhile, ignored all this talk about Roaring Tokens and waited for Freya. According to their agreement, they were to meet here once again.</p>

  <p>As she went on her way to the gathering place, Freya could feel the gaze of numerous Soul Sea Realm warriors on her. It made goose bumps rise on her skin and some even went so far as to even invite her to mine with them. She refused, of course, not missing the way their eyes roamed lewdly on her body.</p>

  <p>She was also thinking about the voice everyone heard yesterday. There was still some suspicion in her heart regarding to the identity of this young man.</p>

  <p>She had listened attentively to every word he had said and couldn't help but think that it was too similar to Luo Zheng's voice. In fact, it was exactly the same!</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng was only a warrior that had ascended from the Lower World.</p>

  <p>There was no way he had Roaring Tokens with him and carelessly squandered so many of them.</p>

  <p>There was simply no way.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Luo Zheng in the gathering place, Freya quickly approached him. "Let's go!" she said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded in response. His goal was to dig up the life vitality jades at the bottom of the mine. The more he got, the faster he could obtain his freedom.</p>

  <p>However, on their way to the mine, Freya started asking Luo Luo Zheng a lot of questions which put him on high alert.</p>

  <p>She seemed to be suspecting him though Luo Luo Zheng could understand why. She probably heard his voice yesterday and wanted to confirm her assumptions. However, it would be impossible for her to verify it this way. So long as Luo Luo Zheng did not admit it, then Freya would be left with nothing but her wild guesses.</p>

  <p>In the midst of their conversation, they did not notice the eyes that watched them as they entered the mine.</p>

  <p>A kind of system had formed among those who had recently ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>The warriors were divided into three factions with the most powerful one led by someone called Riyad Qiu.</p>

  <p>The bald warrior slapped to the point of death by Luo Luo Zheng yesterday was actually one of Riyad's subordinates. How would some baldy like him dare rob someone if he didn't have a powerful backer?</p>

  <p>Riyad was someone who had already accumulated the required amount of life vitality jades. He had originally planned to leave as soon as he turned over his mined ores but decided to stay and accumulate more life vitality jades. He planned to use this surplus to purchase resources that could aid him in his cultivation once he left.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the two other forces also had the same plan. In fact, there was a kind of tribute system that had developed in the mine wherein the warriors not only had to give their earnings to the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, but also allocate a percentage to the three forces.</p>

  <p>The six warriors that had run away yesterday had gone to Riyad and aired their grievances. Riyad, as the one who held the most power in the mine, took Luo Zheng's actions as a challenge to his authority.</p>

  <p>Newly ascended warriors were often conceited since they were not aware of who was boss. Those who offended Riyad's men often disappeared without a trace.</p>
