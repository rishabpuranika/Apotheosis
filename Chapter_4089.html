<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the eastern region of the Ghost Mountain, the human heroes could also feel the earth quaking violently.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven looked a bit sullen, his eyes downcast in frustration.</p>

  <p>He knew that the only one who could cause such a ruckus was the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>This had happened before. When the Primeval Lord of Heaven showed the blended bloodline to the Monkey Spirit King, the earth trembled, similar to now.</p>

  <p>Such a violent reaction could only mean that the Monkey Spirit King reacted strongly to the wolf teeth, and that he was about to wake up.</p>

  <p>The real Snake Goddess, real Fuxi, Zhurong and Chiyou all knew what the quaking earth entailed.</p>

  <p>Everyone stood about anxiously, and the atmosphere darkened with worry.</p>

  <p>No one was willing to sit and wait for imminent death.</p>

  <p>"If the Monkey Spirit King really wakes up, will the Monkey Masters attack us?" a human hero asked.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded affirmatively. "Yes."</p>

  <p>They were just vassals to the Monkey Masters in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Masters wouldn't hesitate to abandon vassals.</p>

  <p>"Should we try to fight back?" asked Emperor Charm apprehensively.</p>

  <p>"Of course," answered Fuxi without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Even if death was imminent, there was no way they were going to die without putting up a fight.</p>

  <p>They all knew the consequence of their resistance.</p>

  <p>Even if they had the Light of Annihilation and the hatred-level Treacherous Beings on their side, they were still no match for the Monkey Masters.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Monkey Spirit King was bound to wake up soon. When he did, the disparity in strength would be unfathomable.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>The vibrations of the Ghost Mountain came one after another, becoming more and more intense with each one that passed.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned deeply as he observed the looks of uneasiness in his companions. "Is there any way to escape?"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven shook his head sadly. "Not in this condition."</p>

  <p>At least, there was a chance for the Great Ghost Priests to leave.</p>

  <p>But they had to ask permission from the Monkey Masters first. Otherwise they could only leave if they were assigned tasks.</p>

  <p>Before, the Primeval Lord of Heaven had once devised a plan to repair the passageway of the Night View Island, and they wanted to give it a try. So, the Monkey Masters had allowed them to temporarily leave the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>However, his plan had failed, and the passageway of the Night View Island remained broken.</p>

  <p>Now, the human race was practically under house arrest. The chances of them being allowed to leave were slim.</p>

  <p>At this point, everyone was at a loss for ideas. Just then, the vibrations ringing throughout the mountain intensified to an almost unbearable level.</p>

  <p>The whole mountain shook violently, as though it were about to snap any second now.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Crack!</p>

  <p>Just then, a loud crack rang out from within the mountain, as though an eggshell had been cracked, except the noise was magnified a thousand times.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this deafening sound, everyone exchanged anxious glances.</p>

  <p>"Strange. Even if the Ghost Master woke up, he wouldn't make such a sound..."</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The cracks continued to climb along the Ghost Mountain, until they reached the east.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the mountain collapsed in half!</p>

  <p>Light streamed into the cave as chunks of the mountain began to crumble.</p>

  <p>Fuxi's eyes flashed as though he had suddenly realized something. In a heartbeat, he dashed out into the mountainside.</p>

  <p>As he looked at something in the distance, his mouth fell open in shock and his eyes were filled with horror.</p>

  <p>"Fuxi, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess shuddered slightly. She had no idea what would make Fuxi react in such a way. Following closely behind, she too stepped out into the light to see what Fuxi was looking at. Then, her body began to tremble violently.</p>

  <p>In the distance, a giant ape the size of a mountain was ravaging through the debris that was once the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>"The Monkey Spirit King smashed the Ghost Mountain apart!"</p>

  <p>"We can leave!"</p>

  <p>"This is our chance to escape!"</p>

  <p>Overcome with relief and joy, the human heroes began to jump in excitement.</p>

  <p>On the surface, they were Great Ghost Priests, but truth of the matter was they were imprisoned slaves.</p>

  <p>While creatures from the outside tried their best to get in, the human heroes within were actually trying their best to escape.</p>

  <p>Now was their chance, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to finally leave this wretched place!</p>

  <p>"Let's go out first," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said cautiously.</p>

  <p>Just as they were about to leave, they saw some Monkey Masters rushing out from the cracks of the Ghost Mountain, following closely behind the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven hissed, motioning for everyone to stop in their tracks.</p>

  <p>If the Monkey Masters caught them trying to escape, they would probably be killed on the spot.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven watched closely as the Monkey Masters ran to catch up to their leader. They were surprisingly fast, even faster than the massive Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"Why are those Monkey Masters desperately chasing after the Monkey Spirit King?" the Snake Goddess asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>It was strange enough that the Ghost Mountain split apart when the Monkey Spirit King awakened, but it was stranger still to see the Monkey Masters chasing after him.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>As soon as the Monkey Spirit King jumped onto the Night View Island, he swiveled around and slapped at the Monkey Masters at his heels.</p>

  <p>Those unfortunate enough to have caught up to him were blown away.</p>

  <p>They smashed into the side of the Ghost Mountain, creating deep holes in the mountainside.</p>

  <p>"The Monkey Spirit King is attacking the Monkey Masters!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven cried out in shock.</p>

  <p>"Look! The Eye Spirit is on the shoulder of the Monkey Spirit King!"</p>

  <p>Zheng pointed out. His eyesight was extremely sharp.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit and Sewell stood on each shoulder of the Monkey Spirit King like flies. The Monkey Spirit King had been moving very fast, so no one noticed them initially.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's words, true enough, everyone saw that the Eye Spirit and Sewell were perched on the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Then, it instantly dawned on them.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King was probably under the control of the Eye Spirit!</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm laughed sarcastically.</p>

  <p>He had long known that the Element Spirit Civilization was evil.</p>

  <p>Something like this should've been expected from them. And yet, the superior Monkey Masters still chose to trust them.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm felt somewhat pleased to see that he had been right all along.</p>

  <p>"Let's follow them and see what's going on! Everyone, follow me!"</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven barked his orders and led the group as they flew out of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Just as they arrived at the annular mountain range, they saw the Monkey Spirit King slam his huge body against a mountain like some lunatic.</p>

  <p>Each mountain in the annular mountain range was hundreds of thousands of feet high, but next to the massive Monkey Spirit King, they looked like small hills.</p>

  <p>Under the impact of the Monkey Spirit King's body, the mountain immediately collapsed.</p>

  <p>There were two races living in that mountain. With their home being smashed into pieces, this was like the end of the world for them.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Once the mountain had completely collapsed, the Monkey Spirit King jumped high into the air and landed with a loud crash.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Under the impact, the whole Night View Island sank about thirty feet. The earth quaked outwards, like some violent ripple effect, causing a wild tsunami in the lake.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King continued to wreak havoc haphazardly.</p>

  <p>Sometimes he walked normally, but then he would suddenly smash his ginormous hands into the ground.</p>

  <p>The creatures on the Night View Island were absolutely terrified. As the Monkey Spirit King, who was larger than their tallest mountain, ravaged the lands, they feared they would be smashed into a pulp.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is the Monkey Spirit King doing?" Chiyou asked in confusion, his brows furrowing deeply.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Snake Goddess flickered with understanding. "He hasn't awakened yet, but he can sense that the Element Spirit Civilization is trying to control his body, so he is desperately trying to resist!"</p>

  <p>"That makes sense." Fuxi nodded and continued, "It does seem like there are two forces fighting to control his body."</p>
