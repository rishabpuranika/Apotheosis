  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ibrahim smiled mischievously with an evil glint in his eyes. Turning to Reynald, he said, "Those guiders from the Oneness the Sky Palace have arrived. Kindly deal with them, Reynald. I shall stay here."</p>

  <p>Reynald then lightly touched his nose, activating the Grand Teleportation technique. In an instant, he vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>Laura and Ingram perked up at what Ibrahim just said. If it was true that the guiders had been sent here, they had some hope yet.</p>

  <p>But before their hopes could be realized, Reynald had returned nonchalantly, and tossed something into the air.</p>

  <p>With an audible thump, several round objects rolled on the ground.</p>

  <p>To Laura's horror, she realized what those things were: human heads.</p>

  <p>"The men sent by the Oneness Sky Palace were so lame. I thought I would finally get to have some fun. Boring!" Reynald complained disdainfully.</p>

  <p>Laura looked up at Reynald and yelled, "They are sent by the Oneness Sky Palace! How dare you kill them like that? Aren't you afraid of irritating the Oneness Sky Palace? They will definitely avenge their men."</p>

  <p>"That thought did cross my mind, of course. After all, they are considered most dignified and authoritative among the human beings. But do you really think they will care about these small characters? How naive you are!"</p>

  <p>"Zheng was chosen by Master Athemar himself. If he doesn't go to the Oneness Sky Palace, Master Athemar will definitely find out," Laura threatened.</p>

  <p>"Ha ha! By the time he catches wind of this, I'd have already left the Seven-Star Province. The real question is, how long can you guys survive?"</p>

  <p>Reynald grinned menacingly.</p>

  <p>Laura grew silent.</p>

  <p>The disciples exchanged helpless glances. Their only hope was Zheng now.</p>

  <p>However, with each minute that passed, the hope Zheng gave them shrank smaller and smaller.</p>

  <p>Another day passed in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>On the fourth day, the Latent Theurgy of Laura had dimmed tremendously.</p>

  <p>Obviously, it was on the verge of sputtering out.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng grew restless.</p>

  <p>While he believed in Dora's promise, the fact that the Latent Theurgy was weakening was like death at their doorstep. How could anyone stay calm in this situation?</p>

  <p>That evening, the sun hung low in the sky, coloring the land a deep, demonic red.</p>

  <p>The scent of blood permeated the air, mixed with the aroma of rotting corpses.</p>

  <p>The Seven-Star City, which was prosperous and bustling before, had now turned into a bloodbath. Severed limbs and bloods dotted the pavement.</p>

  <p>Bodies were strewn everywhere. What made everything worse was the extreme silence that had fallen over the city, as though not a living soul had stepped foot there in a long time.</p>

  <p>"This way! Hurry up!" a man from the Black Armor race shouted, piercing through the deafening silence.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred women gathered, speechless from fear.</p>

  <p>The sole reason these women were kept alive was for future feeding, or worse. The Black Armor race were a beastly sort. To keep on living in fear of what was going to happen was even more terrifying than being killed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, two figures materialized in the sky, standing on a thousand foot long sword.</p>

  <p>For some reason, however, none of the members of the Black Armor race below noticed the scene above them.</p>

  <p>Winchell gazed upon the Seven-Star City below him and frowned. "It's even worse than we imagined."</p>

  <p>Goran sighed. "That's why I disapproved of Athemar's idea of setting up a sect in such places. He planted a seed here, but didn't take good care of it.</p>

  <p>Yet, the ones who suffered were the humans here..."</p>

  <p>Naturally, those who held high positions like them couldn't take care of everything and everyone. However, it was still cruel to have let the forces like the Sword Light Palace run their own course.</p>

  <p>"Humph! I'm going to kill that demon plant! Master Goran, please deal with those Black Armor race members."</p>

  <p>Without further ado, Winchell rushed towards the Seven-Star City. Bang! A huge hole appeared atop the Seven-Star Mountain, and Winchell headed straight into it.</p>

  <p>By contrast, Goran approached his task much more quietly and unhurriedly.</p>

  <p>He pulled out a small green sword from his pocket. He then flicked the sword gently with his finger.</p>

  <p>As the sword vibrated from his flick, a same small sword suddenly appeared and hovered above every single member of the Black Armor race and each Man-eating Demon Flower. "Fall."</p>

  <p>Each small sword obeyed, falling directly on its target.</p>

  <p>Woosh!</p>

  <p>Each True God and warrior at the Other Shore Realm was killed instantly by the raining swords.</p>

  <p>There was absolutely no resistance, nor cries of pain. Most of the victims had no idea what was coming for them.</p>

  <p>The humans imprisoned in the Seven-Star City were all petrified as they watched their persecutors fall one by one...</p>

  <p>Once what was happening finally dawned on them, they were overjoyed.</p>

  <p>"It must be a mighty warrior of our human race who has saved us!"</p>

  <p>"Who could it be?!" "So powerful!"</p>

  <p>"Karma! They deserve to die!"</p>

  <p>Just as these people were yelling with joy, a deafening explosion suddenly sounded inside the Seven-Star Mountain.</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>The power of the explosion made the whole mountain quiver. Every creature within miles of the explosion felt its violent vibration.</p>

  <p>Moments later, Winchell held up a green bead as he approached Goran. "It's rare to see a Man-eating Demon Flower in this level! But its essence bead is useless for me!" he said, throwing the bead to Goran.</p>

  <p>After pocketing it, Goran turned towards the north. "What a coincidence," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"What are you saying?" Winchell asked confusedly.</p>

  <p>"The person you want to rescue is three thousand miles away from the north of the Sword Light Palace. And I sense that the Latent Theurgy, which I gave to the woman in the Sword Light Palace, is also three thousand miles away in the same direction. Coincidently, the Heaven Earth Umbrella can only last five days," Goran laughed.</p>

  <p>The Latent Theurgy was a gift Goran gave to Laura. Goran, of course, could easily sense its whereabouts.</p>

  <p>"It seems that I owe you another favor," said Winchell with a laugh.</p>

  <p>Activating the Grand Teleportation, the two of them traveled towards the north in a flash.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>At the sound of the explosion, Zheng looked in the direction of the Sword Light Palace.</p>

  <p>No ordinary person would be able to make such a loud noise. Laura and Ingram quickly realized this. They exchanged excited glances, as the familiar feeling of hope welled up within them.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Ibrahim's and Reynald's expressions darkened.</p>

  <p>"What happened in the Sword Light Palace?" For the first time, Reynald seemed to be anxious and not in control.</p>

  <p>"Let me have a look!" Ibrahim said.</p>

  <p>But before he could do so, laughter rang through the place. They all looked upward, the direction from which the laughter came. "Your men are all dead. No need to have a look now, dude."</p>

  <p>Ibrahim was stunned. Reynald's jaw dropped, unable to hide his shock.</p>

  <p>How did these two people manage to sneak in from above?</p>

  <p>As for Laura, she stared at the man behind Winchell. Goran, the one who sent her the Latent Theurgy, returned her gaze.</p>
