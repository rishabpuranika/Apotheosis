<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Zheng was stunned when he saw the gentle smile on War King Wind's face.</p>

  <p>What did his smile mean? Why was a dignified war king acting so polite to him? He was a nobody.</p>

  <p>Though curious, Zheng felt grateful. Turner had protected him time and time again. He bowed to Turner and said, "Thank you, your majesty."</p>

  <p>Turner shook his head and said "There's no need for you to thank me. In fact, I should be the one thanking you. On behalf of the people of the Harlen Divine Kingdom, thank you!"</p>

  <p>Zheng fought in the battle representing Lord Randy and the Harlen Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>The battle between him and the little monster had ended and Zheng had been victorious. From now on no one would ever dare to challenge him again.</p>

  <p>Zheng was able to neutralize a full-powered strike from a Soul Sea Realm master, which was an extremely powerful move. So now none of the warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm would dare to fight him. If any of them did, they would suffer great humiliation.</p>

  <p>Besides, this battle had been an evaluation of the warriors without involving any interest from any of the parties.</p>

  <p>Lord Randy suddenly asked with a smile, "Father, since Zheng won the battle, what reward will you offer him?"</p>

  <p>"A reward? But of course! How could I forget?!" Turner turned to Zheng and asked, "I hear you have an urgent need for life stones, am I right? We have a few left in our treasure house. Those..."</p>

  <p>Zheng interrupted Turner refusing his offer, "Thank you, your majesty, but I don't need the life stones now."</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know exactly how many life stones were in the Harlen Divine Kingdom. He had been told that most of the life stones would be used up instantly after they were discovered and because their stock wasn't large, a dozen life stones wouldn't be enough to save Yudie's life.</p>

  <p>Zheng decided to go looking for more life stones on his own in the Feather Holy Sea.</p>

  <p>He was now mostly concerned about Xun, who had fallen into a deep sleep. Her weak soul was now like a candle in the wind. It could be extinguished at any time so he had to work fast.</p>

  <p>He needed to find a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood in order to save her.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, my friend?" Turner was surprised. He knew Zheng had been eagerly inquiring about the life stones but now he was rejecting his offer without a second thought. He couldn't figure out why. "Since you don't want the life stones, what can I offer you instead?"</p>

  <p>Zheng cupped his hands and begged eagerly, "Your majesty, I would like a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood."</p>

  <p>"Soul Nurturing Wood?" Turner raised his eyebrows and stared at Zheng with a curious look. The Soul Nurturing Wood served as a container for souls. Under normal circumstances it was useless. Why would Zheng want it so eagerly?</p>

  <p>Turner didn't have any Soul Nurturing Wood but that didn't deviate his curiosity.</p>

  <p>He sighed helplessly and said, "Sorry, my friend, but we don't have any Soul Nurturing Wood in our Harlen Divine Kingdom."</p>

  <p>Once there was a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood in the Harlen Divine Kingdom, but it was used to store the soul of a Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>Turner had no idea where he could find one for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng was expecting this answer from Turner.</p>

  <p>He had never asked anyone for a reward before but he needed the Soul Nurturing Wood to help Xun. He had no other choice but to be honest and say, "I know that there's no Soul Nurturing Wood in the Harlen Divine Kingdom, but..."</p>

  <p>Zheng stopped. He looked at War King Wind and Fiona. He then turned back to Turner and continued, "As far as I know, there is another piece of Soul Nurturing Wood in the Wind Divine Kingdom."</p>

  <p>War King Wind was taken aback by Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>There was indeed a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood in the Wind Divine Kingdom but it had been given by the secret sect's Reverse Spirit Channel. Most people didn't know about it, including Turner. The Wind Divine Kingdom had not used this piece of Soul Nurturing Wood and it had been kept by War King Wind.</p>

  <p>Now he was wondering how did Zheng know about this secret.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for War King Wind to understand the meaning of the great world's will. Otherwise, the Divine Kingdom Continent wouldn't have been unable to reveal the identity of the little monster.</p>

  <p>Zheng, who now possessed the will of the great world, was in an omniscient state. He could receive all the information of this great world in an instant if he wanted. There were no longer any secrets that could be kept from Zheng.</p>

  <p>Turner was even more curious. How could Zheng know about something that even he did not know about?</p>

  <p>He turned to War King Wind with inquiring eyes and asked, "Wind, is this true? Do you really have a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood?"</p>

  <p>War King Wind nodded as he gently swiped his space ring. As he did that, a brown branch appeared in his hand. The branch looked ordinary, as a branch from any tree.</p>

  <p>But looking closely at its texture one could feel there was something odd about it. It was as if the branch was pulling one's soul into it.</p>

  <p>"Wind..." Turner looked hesitant. War King Wind knew that he wanted him to offer the Soul Nurturing Wood to Zheng. The Soul Nurturing Wood had magical effects on nurturing souls. It could only be used after one's body had been destroyed. It wasn't an easy object to find but it was not valuable for most people. War King Wind offered it with one condition,</p>

  <p>"I can give you my Soul Nurturing Wood, but you have to answer me one question."</p>

  <p>Zheng would do anything to get this piece of Soul Nurturing Wood. He would pay any price for it, no matter what War King Wind would demand in return.</p>

  <p>He never thought War King Wind would ask him for information though.</p>

  <p>Zheng held many secrets, some he couldn't reveal. Some secrets would make most warriors lose their minds. If he asked a question that Zheng couldn't answer honestly, it would be a great problem.</p>

  <p>Oblivious to Zheng's dilemma, War King Wind asked directly, "How did you know that I have a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood? Who told you that?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyelids twitched with hesitation. This was undoubtedly a hard question to answer.</p>

  <p>"Just tell me honestly who told you that. I won't hold anyone accountable. After all, this isn't a big secret. I'm just curious, you know."</p>

  <p>War King Wind added with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the Soul Nurturing Wood. He was in a dilemma. He couldn't tell War King Wind that he had inherited the will of this great world.</p>

  <p>Locating the Soul Nurturing Wood in the possession of War King Wind had been an easy task for Zheng. If he wanted, he could easily figure out how War King Wind had grown to this level, what kind of cultivation technique he learnt, and even what abilities he acquired. Now he could know all kinds of things if he wanted.</p>

  <p>This was how amazing his state of omnipotence was.</p>

  <p>Zheng hesitated for a moment. He was inquiring about the origin of this piece of Soul Nurturing Wood in his mind. He wanted to find out how many people had known about this piece of Soul Nurturing Wood and see if he could come up with a possible excuse.</p>

  <p>The result was quite disappointing. After the Soul Nurturing Wood was passed down from the Reverse Spirit Channel, Marine had personally handed it over to War King Wind. Only a few people knew about its existence, including Marine and Fiona.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't possibly lie that Marine was the one who had told him about it. He believed that she would expose his lie immediately.</p>

  <p>But what about Fiona?</p>

  <p>Zheng looked to Fiona. To his surprise she was staring back at him. Fiona was War King Wind's daughter and Zheng didn't think she would help him to cover up his lie.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter? Is it such a hard question to answer?" War King Wind asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng gritted his teeth. He tried to think about something to offer War King Wind to trade for the Soul Nurturing Wood. Anything would be better than revealing his secret.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, Fiona suddenly broke the silence and said, "Father, it was me who told him about it."</p>

  <p>"What?" War King Wind couldn't believe her words and looked at her with an astonished look. "You told him? When did you do that?"</p>

  <p>"Just a few moments ago when Zheng asked his king about the Soul Nurturing Wood, I used my life vitality and whispered it into his mind,"</p>

  <p>Fiona said with a graceful and calm smile on her face.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" War King Wind asked as he stared closely at Zheng.</p>

  <p>This was unexpected but since she offered to help him he wouldn't be so stupid and deny it. He immediately nodded and said, "Yes, your daughter told me that you had a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood."</p>

  <p>Even though this excuse was far-fetched, it could work if both of them confirmed it.</p>

  <p>However, War King Wind didn't believe Fiona's words at all. He knew his daughter very well and, with just a glance, he could tell that she was lying. He was only curious about Zheng's secret, and since his daughter had stepped in, he would not make things more difficult for Zheng.</p>

  <p>He passed the Soul Nurturing Wood to his daughter. Fiona walked towards Zheng and handed the Soul Nurturing Wood to him.</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" Zheng said with gratitude as he took the Soul Nurturing Wood and his hands trembled with excitement. Now he could help save Xun's soul.</p>

  <p>Fiona blinked and gave Zheng a soft smile before she turned around and returned to her father.</p>

  <p>War King Wind had witnessed all his daughter's acts and expressions. He raised his head to look at the sky. No one knew what was going on in his mind.</p>
