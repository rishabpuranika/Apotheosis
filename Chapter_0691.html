</p>

  <p>Realizing what Luo Luo Zheng must've been planning, Michael, Xiao, and the middle-aged man were at such a loss for words.</p>

  <p>"That guy right there... What is he thinking?" Michael then turned to look at the Picture Slab.</p>

  <p>With his mustache quivering, Xiao replied, "Isn't it obvious? He's going to do away with some other cultivator's crow zombies!"</p>

  <p>Furrowing his eyebrows quite deeply, the middle-aged man remarked, "In spite of the fact that he successfully defended his tower and managed to clear out his crow zombies in a short period of time, there are still rules he has to follow. We are still just in the first step of the competition, and fights among cultivators should be included in the second step of the pre-qualifying test. He's not supposed be having a go at competing with another warrior, at least not until they have already survived the first ten rounds of attacks from various beasts! It's clear that he broke the rules we set!"</p>

  <p>Shaking with laughter, the old man with the family name of Xiao retorted,</p>

  <p>"I don't really see it that way. Our rules don't necessarily go against his strategy. It wasn't specifically said that it can't be done"</p>

  <p>"That may be true, he might not be going against the rules, but he's definitely cheating!" The middle-aged man, to all intents and purposes, wasn't fond of Luo Zheng's actions. Cultivators were supposed to protect their towers during the first step and then proceed to steal from others in the second. No one had ever dared to try to pull off a stunt like stealing others' beasts to kill at the beginning!</p>

  <p>They were somewhat open to the idea of a person breaking the rule using Luo Zheng's strategy. However, in its entirety, no one had ever managed to kill all of the beasts assigned to them during the first step, let alone steal from other participants. After all, it wouldn't be a great idea to leave their own towers unprotected as someone could grab that window of opportunity to siege it.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be that hard to come up with such a strategy, as many warriors had really considered doing it. But no one actually put it into practice until now. It was just the first time someone managed to really pull it off.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was the first guy, and currently the only one as well.</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't necessarily count as cheating. Your rules have a few loopholes. And Luo Luo Zheng just happened to be good at finding one and exploited it. You shouldn't be blaming him for anything at all. Has any other participant ever attempted to do something like that?" Xiao insisted, for he was actually somewhat burning with anticipation and wondering whether Luo Luo Zheng would be able to make it through the pre-qualifying test and how far he could go during the main draw match.</p>

  <p>"If you say so..." The middle-aged cultivator didn't bother arguing anymore because of the way Xiao saw things made enough sense. But he was just so anxious about what might happen if they didn't put an end to his antics soon.</p>

  <p>The cultivator whose tower was located right next to Luo Zheng's was desperately trying to do all he could just to survive inside the blanket of toxic fumes.</p>

  <p>The gas should be avoided at all costs. It didn't really matter how strong and powerful a cultivator might be, his skin would wear away instantly if the gas got in contact with it. Even though he wouldn't actually get hurt physically in the magic array, he would still risk losing the game.</p>

  <p>It was like a gargantuan task for this cultivator to get away from the cloud of toxic gas and keep his tower safe at the same time as he was only at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>While he was so engaged in trying to kill as many crow zombies as he could, the cultivator suddenly noticed a man approaching him at a moderate speed. The pitiful man seemed so lost.</p>

  <p>"What's going on here? Are there also going to be attacks from other competitors aside from the beasts?"</p>

  <p>The cultivator had been left dumbfounded for a moment there, but he immediately comprehended what was happening as he witnessed Luo Luo Zheng going ahead and killing crow zombies. But Luo Luo Zheng had come from the tower next to his.</p>

  <p>The rule was made clear, you had to acquire as many points as possible to make it through the test of the magic array. Meaning to say, points were crucial to each of them!</p>

  <p>In the span of the first ten rounds of attacks, all of the participants were tasked to protect his or her tower while annihilating those foul beasts. So, all the survivors basically had the opportunity to receive the same number of points at the end if they managed to clear their designated areas.</p>

  <p>But at that time, Luo Luo Zheng went over to another area with the intention of killing another warrior's beasts to get points. This made zero sense whatsoever in the eyes of this warrior.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that the cultivator was already having difficulties just from keeping up with the swarm of crow zombies, there was no way in hell he would want someone to take points which were supposed to be for him. The annoyed man cried out, "Go away."</p>

  <p>He dashed toward Luo Luo Zheng, trying to slash him.</p>

  <p>"I just want to give you a helping hand..." Luo Luo Zheng justified his reason for being there, wearing a cunning smile as he laid waste to the crow zombies as fast as he possibly could.</p>

  <p>The cultivator yelled furiously, "Who said I needed help? Get away from my place! Who do you think you are? Are you trying to play God?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng chuckled, totally unfazed by the angry man. What he needed to do was pass the pre-qualifying match. The swarm of crow zombies in front of him would give him even more points, which would surely earn him more advantages in the second stage. With that in mind, just how could anyone let such an awesome opportunity slip away?</p>
