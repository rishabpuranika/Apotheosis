<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 710 A Bully Is Always A Coward (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Prior to then, they had already been amazed that two such disciples appeared up there, thinking that the fact they got qualified was so incredible.</p>

  <p>And now, who would've ever thought that a guy merely at the fourth grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm would also arrive at the waiting area alongside them? They thought their eyes had been playing tricks on them, causing gossip to spread amongst the other competitors.</p>

  <p>"How on earth could a guy who is merely at the fourth grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm have been admitted to the main draw match? The second he steps foot onto the arena, I'm afraid he'll be turned to mincemeat in the blink of an eye."</p>

  <p>"I wonder how he even managed to get qualified at all. At his level of strength, there's no doubt that he wouldn't be able to pass the pre-qualifying match, but in actuality, he has gotten himself into the main draw match.</p>

  <p>That's kind of weird!"</p>

  <p>"So what if he somehow managed to receive the qualification? With the amount of strength he has, entering the arena would be virtually the same as diving at the jaws of death."</p>

  <p>In the midst of the uproar, a wave of laughter made its way through the martial artists. The audible laugh was originating from the disciple of the Platanus Sect. He stated in a roaring voice, "I know just how this man was able to get his qualification."</p>

  <p>Those words were more than enough to draw everyone's attention. "How did he pull it off?" asked one of the warriors.</p>

  <p>"I was there when he had his pre-qualifying match. We actually took it on the same day. During the second stage of magic array examination, would you believe me when I say, he had a twelve-level pagoda to his name?! A twelve-level tower could be comparable to twelve strong men at the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Having such an impressive pagoda, without a doubt, he could pass the pre-qualifying match with such ease even if he simply slept throughout the pre-qualifying match," exclaimed the disciple. The truth was that he had actually coughed up more than a hundred supreme life vitality crystals just to acquire a spot in the main draw match, causing him to bear ill will against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Would you be able to stand against something like that?"</p>

  <p>"Could that possibly mean the World Commercial Alliance has been giving him some kind of a special treatment?"</p>

  <p>"That's just so unfair. I'm having a hard time believing the World Commercial Alliance would be capable of pulling a stunt like that."</p>

  <p>Seeing that a handful of the warriors were hesitant to trust the validity of his statement, that disciple went ahead and remarked, "So, you don't believe the words I say? Then go ahead, come to that man and ask him about it." With that utterance, he motioned over to Owen, who looked quite standoffish and quiet, with his machete handy.</p>

  <p>With their eyes deeply fixated on him beaming with curiosity, Owen had no choice but to nod along and say, "Indeed, he owned a twelve-grade pagoda, but whether the World Commercial Alliance has been giving him some kind of special treatment is something I'm not really sure about. If I may say so, I honestly think he possesses a great amount of strength."</p>

  <p>Hearing those words loud and clear, Luo Zheng held genuine admiration for him deep inside and regarded him as an opponent of great importance. It should be in his best interest to keep an eye on him when the time came.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that Owen was just at the ultimate level of the Illuminating Soul Realm and looked as though he could possibly be the weakest one amongst the independent martial artists, Luo Zheng could tell at a glance that Owen had actually been blessed with quite a powerful mind which was far more superior to simply having strength. He held no resentment against him for his conduct, however, he seemed to have such a cool-headed disposition at all times. And it was clear as day that only those who believed and had faith in themselves could always stay composed and possess a strong mind.</p>

  <p>And that was the main reason why he thought that he should keep an eye on him.</p>

  <p>But as for that martial artist from the Platanus Sect, Luo Zheng simply paid him no heed, much like an insect that merited no respect. It was just as the saying went, "A bully is always a coward." He might have acted as though he were a triumphant hero, but that was far from the truth, for he was but a vulnerable weakling. 'This guy seems to be dim-witted and can easily burn with intense hostility. I guess it's safe to say that he's probably raring to beat me to a pulp now.'</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was deep in thought about this, the said disciple walked over to him, threatening him with a cold-blooded grin, "Boy, I hope you haven't forgotten how you've messed with me in that magic array. I'm gonna get you for that. Make damn sure. For now, I would suggest you enjoy the last few moments of your pitiful life. Make no mistake about it! I'm gonna beat the crap out of you on the arena!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng showed him a lack of concern and didn't bother humoring the martial artist's scornful remarks with a response, but a glint of a cunning smile popped up in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Despite all of his taunting, Luo Zheng still did not trouble himself into responding at all.</p>

  <p>"You sanctimonious son of a bitch!" the martial artist resorted to using profanities, looking at Zheng's contemptuous eyes. This infuriated him so much that he clenched his fists, producing a grating sound. He was so fuming with anger that he was already willing to tear Luo Zheng to pieces for two pins. Setting aside Zheng's tricks in the magic array a couple of days ago, up until now, he couldn't fathom how a meager junior at the Illuminating Soul Realm would have the guts to look down upon a man of his stature, who was at the middle level of Internal Elixir Realm, and also the most prodigious disciple of the Platanus Sect for the past hundreds of years.</p>

  <p>Sad to say, it was truly a shame that Luo Zheng had utterly disregarded his burning rage.</p>

  <p>Witnessing everything that had transpired with his own eyes, Owen smiled softly, "This Martial Arts Contest could end up being quite interesting."</p>

  <p>At the end of the intermezzo, an elder of World Commercial Alliance suddenly yelled out, "The Mysterious Luna Hall is about to arrive."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, people saw a huge coffin come within sight up in the sky, making its way, much like a cannonball dashing toward the arena.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes widened just a little bit, with a smile creeping onto his face. The major players of the Martial Arts Contest were coming!</p>
