<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 214 The Phoenix Crystal And The Emerald Crystal (Part One) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The resources the White Emperor city had saved over the years couldn't be compared to those of the Cloud Sect and the Burning Sky Palace, but they were a lot more in number than those of the seven noble clans.</p>

  <p>All kinds of spiritual weapons and treasures were stocked up roughly in the wooden frames on the wall, randomly pushed into nooks and corners as if those things didn't seem to be rare in the city.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could choose any three treasures he liked, and he was glad to accept the offer.</p>

  <p>He didn't have a strong interest in spiritual weapons as he had quite a stock of heavenly essence in hand, and he could easily barter it for the weapons.</p>

  <p>He scanned the top rack of the frame, skipping past the spiritual weapons.</p>

  <p>Spencer was surprised to see this. The spiritual weapon was of no use to the powerful men of Illuminating Soul Realm, but Luo Zheng, in his position, should be keen on them. His indifference was peculiar.</p>

  <p>Spencer pointed to a pair of treasured swords at one side. "This pair of treasured swords are called the Double Ring Killing Swords. They are top-grade spiritual weapons with extraordinary power. If you choose them, they will only be counted as one of your three treasures, and are certainly worth more than their value."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded but didn't answer. He still wanted to see the rest of the stock.</p>

  <p>Spencer noticed his disinterest in the weapon and had no choice but to follow Luo Zheng as he stalked forward.</p>

  <p>After walking for a while in the treasure house, Luo Zheng suddenly halted, his eyes locked on a wall not far away.</p>

  <p>Three treasures hung on it. They exuded strong energy, but each of them looked incomplete.</p>

  <p>The first one was an emerald knife. It seemed to be made of jade all over.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the knife point and handle were missing, and only the middle part of the blade was left.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the blade but the purple crystal set in the middle of it that attracted Luo Zheng. The crystal was surrounded by a circle of runes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had seen the runes today. After the second spiritual texture appeared on his body, the latter had become equivalent to a middle-grade spiritual weapon. At that time, two rows of runes had appeared on his arms, same as those on the knife blade.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng frowned as he looked at the three broken weapons, lost in thought.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he discerned that the runes on his arms should be used to inlay.</p>

  <p>Earlier, Luo Zheng had thought that the runes on his arms looked familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had seen them before.</p>

  <p>There was a mention either in Evil Lan's secret collections about refining weapons, or in Chase's Weapon Refining Principle that this kind of runes were used to inlay a crystal.</p>

  <p>The runes had never before appeared on a human body, so Luo Zheng didn't identify them immediately. But now, looking at the broken weapons on the wall with the runes marked on them, he instantly realized what they were.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was struck dumb. It meant that his body was a spiritual weapon, and these crystals could be set in it!</p>

  <p>"What is it? Have you taken a fancy to this stuff?" Spencer smiled.</p>

  <p>"These broken weapons were used by some powerful men of Illuminating Soul Realm. This knife here�it's called 'Jade Butterfly' and used to be the walking saber of Scholar Joss. It was a top-grade spiritual weapon, but unfortunately, it was destroyed by a demon king in a battle.</p>

  <p>The rest of the knife was broken and only the blade is left now. It's not worth a cent though. Its one and only valuable part is the Phoenix Crystal that rests on it."</p>

  <p>"Can this Phoenix Crystal be used to inlay?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Jade Butterfly is potent because of the Phoenix Crystal's effect. I remember that Scholar Joss wielded this knife to cut a hundred times in the blink of an eye! The speed should give the credit to the Phoenix Crystal," Spencer explained, "so we kept the blade."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded and pointed to the blade. "I will choose this one as the first treasure."</p>

  <p>"Yes? Luo Zheng, are you proficient in refining weapons?" As far as Spencer knew, only a weapon refiner would be interested in the crystals. Was Luo Zheng capable of that? Could he really refine weapons with the Phoenix Crystal?</p>

  <p>"Refining weapons?" Luo Zheng shook his head in the negative. He had a preliminary grasp on the method because of the Weapon Refining Principle, but he had not personally tested it so far. He couldn't claim to be a proficient weapon refiner.</p>

  <p>Spencer blinked his eyes in surprise, but still nodded at him. "Luo Zheng, since you have chosen the blade as your first treasure, it is yours now."</p>

  <p>The broken spiritual weapons had been hung in the treasury since long.</p>

  <p>Most people allowed to enter this treasure house were the members of the imperial army. There were weapon refiners in the army, but they wouldn't go to the battlefield to kill an enemy, and rarely got the chance to commit military exploits. They could hardly qualify to enter the treasure house and choose their reward.</p>

  <p>Few people chose the crystals as a reward. The top-grade spiritual weapons were already assembled and aplenty. They were more suited to them.</p>

  <p>"What about the one next to it?" Luo Zheng questioned.</p>

  <p>Another broken weapon hung next to the blade of Jade Butterfly. It was a red spear that had been separated into several parts. Again, a blood red crystal rested in the middle of the spear point.</p>

  <p>They watched as a dim red light flashed inside the blood red crystal. The light grew bright and dim from time to time, like it had its own heartbeat.</p>
