<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The pink figure danced gently in the air and descended slowly like a fairy in an illusory world.</p>

  <p>Just like Luo Luo Zheng, the entire universe knew of this mysterious girl's existence.</p>

  <p>However, they had no idea about her origins, goals, or even where she existed outside the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>Like Luo Luo Zheng, the other warriors also wanted to see how she looked, but her outline was blurry and her exact appearance wasn't clear.</p>

  <p>When the pink figure floated to the edge of the board and came to stand before everyone, she waved her hand and a number of black and white stones appeared around her.</p>

  <p>These stones were about ten feet in diameter and floated in the air, drifting towards the three hundred warriors.</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen, please step onto the stones," the woman in pink said, her voice rather stern.</p>

  <p>People discovered that the voice came from the sky above and not from her.</p>

  <p>It was likely that this pink figure was not a real person but just an illusion.</p>

  <p>But she was still the host of the Illusion Battlefield, and as the sound of her voice faded, each of the three hundred warriors stepped onto a stone.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning did not want to be separated from Luo Luo Zheng, but she had no other choice.</p>

  <p>Those who were really paying attention, noticed something.</p>

  <p>The three hundred warriors had earlier been split into two groups within the purple pillar of light. One group of warriors had fixed fates, while the other group had unfixed fates.</p>

  <p>And right now, the stones beneath the warriors with fixed fates were all white, while those beneath the warriors with unfixed fates were all black.</p>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng was in neither of these groups, he was standing on a black stone as well.</p>

  <p>Whooshing sounds could be heard everywhere, leaving onlookers surprised and confused.</p>

  <p>The moment everyone stepped onto the stones, they were sent flying into the air by the woman.</p>

  <p>The warriors that stood on the black stones were on one side, while those on the white stones were on the other. The woman was floating in the middle.</p>

  <p>This was the final battle of the three hundred warriors in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>But to the woman, it was within the variables and determinants that she had to deduce the destiny of this round of grand era.</p>

  <p>The great crisis that broke out during any round of grand era was usually a grand competition that used the universe as a board and countless creatures as stones.</p>

  <p>She had no way of knowing where the crisis would come from.</p>

  <p>But it would be a predetermined deduction if the ace talents of the universe were to gather together and play a Go game.</p>

  <p>She wanted to see if the crisis in this round of grand era came from the variables or the determinants.</p>

  <p>Right now, countless eyes were watching what was happening on the board. Everyone from the 128 Supreme Lords to normal warriors was paying close attention to this.</p>

  <p>Some warriors were even seeing this as an excellent chance to throw a gambling party and had already started placing bets on these three hundred warriors.</p>

  <p>The woman in pink stretched out her hand and waved it, as if to make a casual grab.</p>

  <p>An enormous hand appeared from within the endless clouds.</p>

  <p>The crowd could see that the huge hand belonged to a girl. The fingers were thin and the skin was smooth and fair.</p>

  <p>The index finger of the hand pressed down on a white stone and the nail of its middle finger clamped onto the bottom of the stone.</p>

  <p>The person standing on this white stone was an ace talent of the Saya race.</p>

  <p>He was also startled when he saw the giant forefinger pressing down on him, but the forefinger was not real and could not touch him. It pierced through his body and was pressing down on the stone.</p>

  <p>Once the huge hand had grabbed the white stone, it pressed down on the 100, 000 feet long board.</p>

  <p>It crunched as it fell onto the board.</p>

  <p>The board seemed to reverberate with the crisp sound of the stone falling.</p>

  <p>The Saya race warrior was still standing steadily on the stone.</p>

  <p>He knew that his opponent would be a warrior among those standing on the black stones.</p>

  <p>Soon, his hunch was confirmed. The huge hand withdrew into the mist, reached out from the other side, and grabbed a black stone.</p>

  <p>And this time, the giant hand was holding onto Margaret's stone.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was stunned.</p>

  <p>She hadn't thought that she would be the first to fight another warrior.</p>

  <p>The black stone fell to the board with a thud.</p>

  <p>"Both of you can fight.</p>

  <p>You need to fight till we have a clear result. But do not kill your opponent." The mysterious girl's voice rang out once again.</p>

  <p>"Hell no! I don't want to fight!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning said, her eyes wide and face gloomy.</p>

  <p>She didn't like fighting. But the number of times she had fought with others in the Illusion Battlefield was most likely ten times more than what it had been before she had entered the battlefield.</p>

  <p>In the previous two stages, Mu Ning had put her life on the line as she fought.</p>

  <p>But it was because she had a motive, and that was to see Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Luo Zheng was by her side, a part of her long-cherished wish had been fulfilled. Fighting with others meant nothing to her. She turned to look at Luo Luo Zheng, her heart filling with this gloom.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng smiled encouragingly at Mu Ning and said, "Do your best!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning nodded reluctantly.</p>

  <p>What she didn't know was that her master, Elder Apeiron, was somewhere in the universe, nervously watching her along with a group of her disciples.</p>

  <p>"Mu Ning doesn't seem to have any fighting spirit."</p>

  <p>"I know why. She cares for nothing but her man. She doesn't have much interest in cultivation."</p>

  <p>"This is truly unfair. The heavens gave her such stunning talent, but didn't give her the heart to pursue cultivation."</p>

  <p>Mu Ning thought for a while, and then stepped off the black stone.</p>

  <p>Although she was still conflicted, a light flick of her fingers brought seven differently colored flying swords floating out of her body. These swords gradually dispersed.</p>

  <p>She stared at the warrior of the Saya race, who was standing close by, smiled and said, "You can start."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng shook his head at how this scene was playing out.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning did not show any improvement. She did not have any fighting spirit, and she was no different from who she had been all those years ago.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng really didn't understand how she could have gotten so far in the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>But what Luo Luo Zheng didn't know was that Mu Ning had been a completely different person in the first stage of the Illusion Battlefield.</p>

  <p>At that time, in order to find Luo Luo Zheng, Mu Ning had traveled through the cities in the Illusion Battlefield. Her Mu Ning hadn't been strong in the first place, and she looked like a delicate human girl. So naturally, she had been ambushed a number of times.</p>

  <p>Her mind had been extremely stable and filled with fighting spirit.</p>

  <p>Whoever stopped her from finding Luo Luo Zheng would become her mortal enemy, and thus, she would be like a goddess of death, killing a terrifying number of warriors.</p>

  <p>But right now, all she wanted was to stay by Luo Zheng's side. How could she have any fighting spirit?</p>

  <p>Now that she was forcefully dragged into the fight, she had no choice but to make a move. It looked like she was being forced into a corner.</p>

  <p>When the Saya warrior saw that his first opponent was a delicate woman without any fighting spirit, he smiled, satisfied.</p>

  <p>The Saya race had been silent for too long. This ancient race was only a second-class race in the universe.</p>

  <p>If he took first place in the Illusion Battlefield this time, obtained a Godly Plate, and became a Godly Genius in the future, he would lead his race to glory once more.</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, the Saya warrior rolled his shoulders in preparation.</p>

  <p>Two thin totems emerged from behind his shoulders, an ancient Mu Ning emanating from them.</p>

  <p>The Saya race was also an ancient race, and they believed in their ancestors.</p>

  <p>Each generation of the Saya race was accumulating power for the next.</p>

  <p>As the son of the Saya race's 36, 330th chief, he could obtain great power from his ancestors.</p>

  <p>'I only need to display twenty to thirty percent of my power in the first match, ' he decided as he faced Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>He then pulled out a black pike from behind him.</p>
