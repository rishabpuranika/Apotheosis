  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng appeared to be grievously injured, but in truth, the damage was only skin deep. The water drops did not hurt his muscles and bones.</p>

  <p>Circles of green light blossomed on Luo Zheng's body, and the surface-level wounds began to heal rapidly.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures saw what was happening, and they were dumbfounded at Luo Zheng's quick recovery.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had persisted for almost a month, while most of the Other Shore creatures retreated again and again. Luo Zheng had been staying on the sixteenth layer to receive training, and the others all reluctantly agreed that Luo Zheng seemed to have gotten used to the sixteenth layer at this point.</p>

  <p>They didn't expect that in the last few days, Luo Zheng would actually leave the Myriad Tribulations Storm, and he appeared to be injured.</p>

  <p>"Is there something wrong with his method of body protection?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps..."</p>

  <p>"Hey. It's clearly good enough for him to hold on for this long at the sixteenth layer. His tribulation skeleton has already surpassed many of ours!"</p>

  <p>Even if Luo Zheng left awkwardly right now, what he had already accomplished was enough for them to recognize him as an extraordinary warrior.</p>

  <p>After all, everyone relied on the method of body protection to stay within the Myriad Tribulations Storm. Although they couldn't see what method Luo Zheng had used to protect his body, it was already quite astonishing that he had held on for almost a month.</p>

  <p>The green light shimmered and bloomed, spreading along the surface of Luo Zheng's body. After about five minutes, Luo Zheng's body returned to normal.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, for his part, was less concerned about his own bodily injuries than about the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be something wrong with the Chaotic Source Spirits," Luo Zheng murmured, frowning.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"I am unable to detect their existence," replied Luo Zheng. He sought to sound calm, but he was deeply concerned.</p>

  <p>Previously, he had been able to clearly sense the Chaotic Source Spirits scattered within his body. Now, however, it seemed that the Chaotic Source Spirits within him had vanished entirely. No matter how he probed, he could not sense them.</p>

  <p>"How could that happen?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits were special. They had been a subject of study for the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess had been able to use them through information hidden in the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed.</p>

  <p>However, despite his extensive study, even the Primeval Lord of Heaven hadn't completely understood the Chaotic Source Spirits. The vast majority of people wouldn't be able to advance when they reached the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm.</p>

  <p>Even Qiu Yinhe and Phoenix would find twenty thousand Jun of power almost too much to be endured. If they wanted to bear a greater amount of power, it could be done only through a special bloodline token or body protection token.</p>

  <p>However, since they couldn't cultivate the Myriad Tribulations Body, the bodies of the Chaotic Source Realm warriors were not strong enough.</p>

  <p>Therefore, there was still an enormous gap between the talented warriors like Auden and Pearce, and the powerful masters like Ying and Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng was something entirely unprecedented. He was probably the first person to step into the Land of Bone Tribulation after fusing with the Chaotic Source Spirits. He didn't expect that such a thing would happen this time.</p>

  <p>"I'll check again," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>If he had truly lost the Chaotic Source Spirits, it would lead to a drastic reduction in his level of strength.</p>

  <p>Without the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits, even if one possessed a Civilization Artifact, the power that they could unleash would be limited.</p>

  <p>The situation would be different if the Inheritance of World was activated.</p>

  <p>However, the Inheritance of World would also cause the Civilization Artifact to consume a lot of energy. It was impossible to keep using it continuously during each battle.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng carefully searched within himself, and finally sensed what was wrong.</p>

  <p>His body was full of tiny light dots, each no larger than the point of a needle. The light dots had been too small for Luo Zheng to notice them without paying close attention. Now, as he probed further, he realized that the light dots were like grains of dust spreading throughout his body.</p>

  <p>"Are these the light dots of the Chaotic Source Spirits which have disappeared? Why have they become so small?" Luo Zheng wondered, feeling stunned at his discovery.</p>

  <p>It seemed that the light dots of the Chaotic Source Spirits had become abnormally small, and yet they had also multiplied in number. Listening, the Primeval Lord of Heaven was also confused, for he had not heard of such a thing happening before.</p>

  <p>'The golden liquid in the Myriad Tribulations Storm is related to the Descending Rings, and the Descending Rings went to the Source World along with the Chaotic Source Spirits. There must be some connection, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, try using these tiny light dots the same way you always use the Chaotic Source Spirits. See if they can help you withstand the power," suggested the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>Everything on the Other Shore could provide some Jun of power, but the amount of power the Chaotic Source Spirits provided was a minus.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven theorized that everything on the Other Shore was simply a projection of energy from the Abstruse Energy World. In his theory, the Chaotic Source Spirits projected all the energy they had absorbed to a certain place in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Of course, he was merely speculating, but he was interested in what Luo Zheng's predicament could reveal about his theory.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. "All right, I'll give it a try," he said.</p>

  <p>He drove the bone plate again and entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm.</p>

  <p>Even without the help of the Chaotic Source Spirits, Luo Zheng was capable of enduring the first layer without sustaining too much damage. At this point, he had been cultivating on the sixteenth layer for nearly a month. With his own tribulation skeleton he would still be able to enter the seventh or eighth layer.</p>

  <p>But his intention now was just to test the tiny light dots. It wouldn't be necessary to advance to the higher layers.</p>

  <p>He immediately felt the vivid blue and golden droplets on his skin.</p>

  <p>In the outermost layer of the Myriad Tribulations Storm, the water drops were sparse, and the power of the black cracks that appeared on Luo Zheng's body was much weaker.</p>

  <p>He paid little attention to the cracks. Instead, he turned his focus to the light dots within his body.</p>

  <p>As a drop of blue and gold water hit Luo Zheng's skin, the tiny light dots in that area vibrated, and then were extinguished.</p>

  <p>"They are fatigued,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said to himself, feeling helpless.</p>

  <p>As the light dots got tired, the Truth of Divine Dao produced by his physical body circulated within him. When it reached the affected light dots, they lit up again like stars.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as they began glowing, another small drop of water hit Luo Zheng's skin, and the light dots immediately died down again.</p>

  <p>These minuscule light dots were constantly getting tired and getting rejuvenated, in a nonstop cycle.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng realized that he would have to go through the entire Chaotic Source Realm again.</p>

  <p>"I've already stepped into the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm. Have I made use of these Chaotic Source Spirits to the limit?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," the Primeval Lord of Heaven answered quickly.</p>

  <p>In the Source World, there were many powerful Chaotic Source Realm warriors, and each of them was countless times older than Luo Zheng. When these warriors cultivated to the late stage of the realm, they all stopped, unable to make any further progress. But they hadn't encountered a situation similar to Luo Zheng's.</p>

  <p>"Then there are two conditions," Luo Zheng said. "The warriors have to cultivate to the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm. And they also need to receive the training of the Myriad Tribulations Storm. Right?"</p>

  <p>"That's possible," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>He thought that based on Luo Zheng's experience, it seemed that the Chaotic Source Spirits had completed a round of division!</p>

  <p>After the fission, it looked like the number of Chaotic Source Spirits in Luo Zheng's body had increased by a huge amount.</p>

  <p>If these Chaotic Source Spirits could grow stronger, and Luo Zheng entered the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm again, would his physical body be able to bear much more Jun of force?</p>

  <p>"What if you cultivate to the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm again, and let the Chaotic Source Spirits split up one more time?" suggested the Primeval Lord of Heaven. At his words, Luo Zheng's eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>If the Chaotic Source Spirits continued to divide infinitely like this, his physical strength would probably increase to a terrifying level!</p>

  <p>It seemed that he would have to stay in the Myriad Tribulations Storm for longer than he had anticipated.</p>
