<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1670 Ultimate Sword Intent </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>After hearing what Tianming said, many martial artists thought that he was quite arrogant.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng simply smiled and nodded. After all, he was no stranger to Tianming's personality.</p>

  <p>Tianming was not an arrogant person. Since he said so, he must be self-confident.</p>

  <p>While a Godly Genius was definitely a powerful being, there was no set rule that said that Godly Geniuses were truly invincible beings.</p>

  <p>Being a Godly Genius just meant that one could follow a Godly Way and comprehend the great internal momentum within it. Although the internal momentum was highly powerful and had surpassed the heavens' limits, it didn't mean that it couldn't be broken.</p>

  <p>Tianming was already this confident even when he was still at the nature level. Luo Zheng just didn't expect that he would still be the same until now.</p>

  <p>From there, it could be said that some people just had certain traits since birth. Even though they were sharpened by the many hardships they had experienced, their nature wasn't bound to change.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Xenia grinned upon hearing Tianming's words.</p>

  <p>She wasn't even angry.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, she just sized up Tianming with a strange look in her eyes.</p>

  <p>There were many talents in the Celestial Position race. Any warrior lucky enough to join them were considered as core disciples in any tenth-grade sacred place. However, they were actually just like a lion's tail in the Celestial Position itself.</p>

  <p>Xenia had never sparred with martial artists of her same generation.</p>

  <p>Still, the warriors from the same generation as her in the Celestial Position were always wary of her. It could be said that their cautiousness had a hint of fear.</p>

  <p>She hated that look.</p>

  <p>Xenia understood her own background growing up. She already looked strong on the outside, and she had even gotten the golden title of 'Rakshasa' of the Celestial Position to boot.</p>

  <p>Yet, she knew deep inside that everyone else around her thought of her as a monster.</p>

  <p>Their seriousness and politeness combined with estrangement made it difficult for her to be close to others.</p>

  <p>Therefore, her master was her only companion as she grew up, then there was an endless sea of loneliness. This girl had been surviving alone in a short span of twenty years, but deep inside she yearned for normal friendship from everyone else.</p>

  <p>She even wished that she was an ordinary person instead.</p>

  <p>If she was an ordinary girl, she'd grow up in a boudoir, have loving parents, maybe even marry a loyal and diligent person and live a simple, short life.</p>

  <p>However, her fate was destined to be different since the very beginning.</p>

  <p>No one spoke to her after she was sent to the Celestial Position race, so they put her in the thunderstorm space of the Celestial Position. There she received the endless support of the holy thunder and lightning, and grew alone with them.</p>

  <p>If it had been any other warrior who had heard Tianming's words, they would simply scoff at him and think that it was nobody's fault for eliminating him since he didn't plan on drawing out his sword.</p>

  <p>Yet, Xenia was different. Her fan-like lashes fluttered, and she looked extremely interested. She quickly smiled and said, "Seriously? Looks like you want me to force you to draw your sword. That sounds interesting!"</p>

  <p>Tianming was slightly startled as well when he heard Xenia's unexpected answer. He thought that it shouldn't be considered interesting.</p>

  <p>However, he still waved the scabbard lightly. "You can make your move now," he said flatly.</p>

  <p>"Alright!"</p>

  <p>With a vigorous nod of her head and a fiery glint in her eyes, Xenia charged forward.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>The lightning bolt crackled loudly as her long purple hair suddenly became straight, and lashed out wildly like a beast's mane.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the lightning around Xenia surged forth like liquid.</p>

  <p>It appeared that the lightning was golden!</p>

  <p>The lightning bolts slowly intertwined with each other until they formed a book page that was as tall as a person.</p>

  <p>Just then, the page of thunder revealed a highly powerful internal momentum--the internal momentum of the Thunderstorm Godly Way!</p>

  <p>Some of the martial artists who watched nearby felt a chill down their spine from the intimidating internal momentum of the Thunderstorm Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Zheng's gaze froze all of a sudden and his eyelids began to twitch violently.</p>

  <p>"This is� The page of the Sanskrit!"</p>

  <p>Back then when the cyan dragon had just awakened, he had communicated with Luo Zheng and affirmed that Zheng's body was most likely the only one of its kind in the entire universe.</p>

  <p>However, the cyan dragon didn't say why.</p>

  <p>After that brief exchange, Luo Zheng gradually realized that the formation of his weapon body back then was perhaps not because of the Divine Flame Cauldron.</p>

  <p>It was no doubt that the Divine Flame Cauldron was a special cauldron that was passed down to the Lower World, and its divine flame had been a great help to Luo Zheng. However, what truly created him was the page of the Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>Whenever Luo Zheng received the training of the fire, the Sanskrit always turned into countless golden vortexes to help him absorb the fire's power and forge himself.</p>

  <p>It was only through this process of absorption and forging that Luo Zheng had reached his current level.</p>

  <p>But where did the golden page of the Sanskrit come from? Why did it have such an effect? Luo Zheng had no way of knowing and he couldn't get anything out of the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng glanced at the golden page that was formed from the golden thunder and lightning in front of him. It looked extremely similar to the page he had absorbed back then.</p>

  <p>"This woman also owns a page like this, but her page is formed from lightning," Luo Zheng muttered. His gaze was fixated on the page as his irises flickered constantly. If there was a chance, he would naturally think of a way to investigate it.</p>

  <p>However, the battle between her and Tianming was a battle of elimination, where only one person should remain. If she lost, Luo Zheng would have to make a trip to the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>"The internal momentum is so powerful," Nathan commented.</p>

  <p>Even an aloof person such as he had looked serious when he had felt the power of the internal momentum.</p>

  <p>Nathan was a master of great skill, and the Godly Way he cultivated was very special. He didn't even look this serious when he had faced several other Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>"One blow. Humph! That human martial artist shouldn't be able to withstand a single move from Xenia."</p>

  <p>"That guy is probably the same as Norvin from the ogre race. He just wants to boast of his strength, regardless of whether he will win or not.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, he is destined to be defeated in the end. Bragging about this sort of thing won't benefit him in any way."</p>

  <p>The endless negative chatter continued, as many warriors shared the same opinion about him.</p>

  <p>Xenia slowly walked towards the page of the Sanskrit, which stood like a door in front of her. All of the Sanskrit words draped themselves around her like a curtain as she walked past. The only difference was while curtain fabric slid sideways, the Sanskrit words were stuck to her body.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng's Sanskrit words had turned into golden vortexes.</p>

  <p>Xenia's Sanskrit released fine bolts of lightning, which spread like a spider's web around her face, neck, and body.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Xenia smiled warmly at Tianming. She slightly lifted her arm, extended a forefinger towards him, then pointed it towards the ground.</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>"Ten directions' lightning annihilation..."</p>

  <p>Her lips curved into a smile again after she spoke and said, "If you don't pull out the sword now, I'm afraid you won't have another chance."</p>

  <p>Her words were followed by numerous purple thunderbolts that appeared continuously on the Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>The thunderbolts looked powerful enough to destroy the whole world, and they rapidly charged towards Tianming all at once!</p>

  <p>However, there was no fear in Tianming's eyes as he faced the incoming thunderbolts head on. He simply stabbed the sword in the ground.</p>

  <p>"Your Thunder Law is very strong, and the power of your internal momentum is already beyond the power that exists in this universe,"</p>

  <p>Tianming said. He smiled faintly at Xenia and continued, "I know that the essential difference between a Godly Genius and an ace talent is their internal momentum. If someone took away your internal momentum, you would only be just as strong as an ace talent...</p>

  <p>To others, the internal momentum is almost impossible to resist," Tianming said as he shook his head. "But to me, it's almost useless."</p>

  <p>Tianming leaned on his long sword after he spoke. A tiny bit of sword intent from the sword scabbard floated.</p>

  <p>Tianming had not yet activated his sword intent, but his sword intent had started to leak out on its own.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw the sword intent, he finally understood where Tianming's confidence lay.</p>

  <p>He also didn't expect that Tianming had actually comprehended the ultimate sword intent in the past few years.</p>

  <p>The ultimate sword intent had become a sort of a limitation in the universe. If he were to advance a bit more, it would surpass the current round of heavens.</p>

  <p>Therefore, to a certain extent, Tianming could also be considered as a being on par to a Godly Genius.</p>
