<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2933 Extinguish The Memory Flame </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Blood red flames burst out from Hamish's eyes and shot towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>Rather than dodge the flames, Zheng simply stood there, letting them hit him.</p>

  <p>As they dissipated, however, he emerged unscathed.</p>

  <p>The Mountain of Holy Beings behind him glimmered with silver light.</p>

  <p>Zheng could transfer the attacks he received to the Mountain of Holy Beings, which could not be destroyed.</p>

  <p>One of Zheng's adversaries, Lorcan, was covered in silken threads of glimmering silver. Some of them hung from his hands. These threads looked soft, but they were sharp as steel. He tried to wrap Zheng in those threads like a spider would catch its prey; however, Zheng resisted them without making the slightest move.</p>

  <p>As long as these Other Shore Realm warriors were not strong enough to take on the entire divine land and win, they could not hurt Zheng there.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a thought flitted through Zheng's mind. As it did, the power of the Everest Spirit Mountain that had gathered in his body began to flow rapidly through his veins, making them black and bulging. He shook with the great power within his body.</p>

  <p>He tapped the air with his finger, emanating an invisible force that spread out, enveloping Lorcan and Hamish.</p>

  <p>Even if Estelle could control the Soul Wilderness, she couldn't compete with Zheng in the use of the Scepter of Gods' Silence.</p>

  <p>Estelle's use of the Scepter of Gods' Silence was as crude as if it were a sledgehammer. She could only silence the entire divine land at once. Zheng, on the other hand, could control the range of his power and use his techniques selectively.</p>

  <p>The same applied to the Everest Spirit Mountain: Zheng could milk every ounce of power from it, unlike Harold, who could only access a small fraction of it.</p>

  <p>Once Lorcan and Hamish were silenced, the silver threads hanging off Lorcan suddenly disappeared, as did the flames on Hamish's body. They were so sucked of power that they collapsed onto the ground, unable to stay suspended in midair.</p>

  <p>Zheng instantaneously teleported to Hamish's side, and without further ado, he pushed through the thickened space around him and punched Hamish with his huge fist.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Immediately, Hamish's body appeared to snap in half and hallow out, the hole becoming more and more pronounced as Zheng's power rained down onto him. Almost in slow motion, his body began to disintegrate and soon turned into a cloud of blood red ash.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasted no time, however. While his right hand was busy destroying Hamish, his left hand produced a black ball, the manifestation of the power of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>With the slightest movement of his hand, the ball flew towards Lorcan, splitting the space around him and engulfing him whole.</p>

  <p>If Lorcan hadn't been silenced by Zheng, he might have been able to resist the black ball. But robbed as he was of all his power, unable even to fly, he couldn't perform any of the theurgies needed to fight the black ball.</p>

  <p>Gradually but surely, the black ball of energy consumed him.</p>

  <p>Then, Samuel appeared in the sky above them, in complete silence, having used the Spear of Supreme Harmony.</p>

  <p>Even a warrior like Hamish was unable to detect the sudden appearance of Samuel.</p>

  <p>However, after Zheng had fused with the will of the divine land, nothing in the divine land could escape Zheng's attention.</p>

  <p>The moment Samuel showed up, Zheng raised his head and gave him an indifferent look.</p>

  <p>That was enough to make Samuel's blood run cold. He tried to remain composed, although his hands trembled. He waved the Spear of Supreme Harmony.</p>

  <p>He realized in his mind that a head-to-head battle with Zheng was unavoidable.</p>

  <p>The Spear of Supreme Harmony emitted an intense wave of Space Law, forming a space spiral, and hurled it towards Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>If this space spiral were to hit a Holy Being, it would probably bore a huge hole in their body. If it were to hit their head, it could go as far as destroy their soul.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, did not flinch or even try to dodge the spiral. As before, the spiral flailed around him wildly, but failed to even scratch him.</p>

  <p>On one side of the Mountain of Holy Beings, a series of spirals appeared in the silver light. The theurgy released by Samuel was completely absorbed by the mountain.</p>

  <p>"Killing these Yellow Emperor Guards is very easy. But not nearly as easy as killing you, Samuel Han," said Zheng, his expression and voice deadpan, as he raised his right hand.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng hadn't yet released any internal momentum, Samuel felt a chill overcome him like a wave. He recoiled instinctively, and retreated quickly, trying to put as much distance between himself and Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing Samuel's reaction, Zheng smirked, and proceeded to stretch out his hand as if to grab something in the air.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Waves of deep rumbles began to sound in the divine land's sky. It was the sound of a universe collapsing.</p>

  <p>All the blood seemed to drain from Samuel's face. "You...destroyed my universe?" he yelled, his voice and entire body shaking violently.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded indifferently. "You shouldn't have even existed in the divine land in the first place," he said, his voice as cold as his expression. "The world will be much better off without you."</p>

  <p>"You!" Samuel's face had gone a shade of dark puce. He was livid.</p>

  <p>Rumble...</p>

  <p>With the collapse of the universe, the elixir field of Samuel also began to disintegrate.</p>

  <p>The destruction of the elixir field could not kill a True God, but they would lose all their power and become a regular human being, no longer able to cultivate.</p>

  <p>This was different for Holy Beings, however, as they created universes which were then merged with themselves. As long as the universe was intact, its creator remained immortal. If the universe was destroyed, the Holy Being that created it would die with it.</p>

  <p>Therefore, people in the Source World were not interested in something like the Rebirth Land. It was not easy to destroy a universe, and hence it could be seen as an advantage, a key to immortality. However, while it was not easy, it was also not impossible. Thus, the connection between the Holy Being and their universe was also a fatal flaw.</p>

  <p>With several loud snapping noises, thousands of tiny cracks formed along the surface of Samuel's elixir field, and then penetrated through his body, scarring his abdomen, chest, neck and even the soul within his mind.</p>

  <p>Samuel had no last words. But he gave Zheng a final glare of hatred before he succumbed to his wounds and died.</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to look into Samuel's eyes emotionlessly. "You have a part of the Stone Mouse's theurgy," he said. "Also, you have hidden your Memory Flame. Did you really think I wouldn't find out?"</p>

  <p>The muscles on Samuel's face, that had, too, begun to crack, twitched. His eyes filled with fear.</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you what you did. You took your Memory Flame from the Reincarnation Land and hid it in the ancestral grave of the Yue Clan, thinking you could still be reincarnated if you died," said Zheng slowly, twisting his hand in the air.</p>

  <p>Immediately, an invisible space wave flew through the divine land like a spear, heading straight for a divine city.</p>

  <p>The Yue Clan had once been the largest clan in the city and one of the large clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>When Gregorio was killed, the city where the Yue Clan had been located became desolate and the ancestral land ended up being destroyed.</p>

  <p>The alliance of the powerful clans had, thereafter, placed a ban on the Yun Clan. Even if the Thousand Commandments Slate remained in the city, no one would dare occupy it. Passersby would lament its destruction, but would not dare enter.</p>

  <p>Then, a moss-covered tomb in the cave of one of the barren mountains behind the divine city suddenly shook.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The lid of the ancient tomb had been flung open by an invisible force. A small brocade box shot out from inside and was quickly sucked into the space channel.</p>
