<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 547 The Evil Fire Mobula (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had met many people like Adler, and chose to ignore them instead of letting their negativity affect his choices during challenges like this.</p>

  <p>Approximately eight disciples were participating in this round of the challenge. The challenge wasn't like other competitions though. Here, they needed each other to overcome all the obstacles that were in their way. If they had tried to fight their way individually, no one would pass this round. Everyone knew the situation very well. So, without hesitation, they united together, except Adler and his company who remained behind.</p>

  <p>They continued to encounter terrifying, unusual creatures as they made their way from pillar to pillar. Every time they encountered a creature, they instantly formed a circle and eliminated it from all directions.</p>

  <p>It went without saying that every disciple there was the strongest and the best one selected from their sect. A common disciple without any remarkable strength would never be able to make it this far. Even the two Iridescence Sect female disciples had extraordinary speed and flexibility, making it possible for them to avoid being attacked by the creatures while eliminating them swiftly. So united, all the disciples marched to the next high platform without much difficulty.</p>

  <p>'This is the right way to do it. Those two from the Brumous Sect were idiots. It was crazy for me to think of them as teammates at first, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought as he rushed along. In reality, none of them thought of one another as a teammate. They knew they had come together only to stay safe. It wouldn't be a surprise to any of them when the final competition started and the current truce ended with them drawing swords against each other.</p>

  <p>"Look! Over there! What the hell is that?" one of the disciples yelled behind Luo Luo Zheng, and rousing him from his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Stopping immediately, Luo Luo Zheng turned around to see what it was. His sharp eyes looked to where the disciple pointed. Not far in the distance, a stream of fluid lava rolled up, and sped towards them. Something gigantic was headed at them under the waves of lava.</p>

  <p>The group shrank back at the sight as they wondered what it would be this time. All they knew, was no matter what, it wouldn't be anything nice or pleasant.</p>

  <p>The unknown creature cut through the lava at breakneck speed as it closed in on them. It sprang up above the lava's crest.</p>

  <p>An ugly creature sprang up in front of everyone, astonishing them. Its mouth hung half open, snarling horribly. It was ten feet wide and resembled a fish, but comparatively, it was a hundred times uglier. With a triangle shaped body and an unmatchable long tail, it looked like a giant kite soaring in the sky. What surprised them the most was the long tail with barbed hooks covering its scales, giving it the appearance of a demon's tail in a childhood storybook.</p>

  <p>"That's an evil fire mobula! Watch out! Why are there so many of them?" yelled a disciple.</p>

  <p>After the first mobula rose from the fire sea, the molten lava began to vibrate and the fluid lava began to ripple in at least thirty spots, which meant there were at least thirty evil fire mobulas headed at the group.</p>

  <p>"Move! Hurry, everyone! Get away from there!" cried another disciple.</p>

  <p>Hearing the alarm in his voice, everyone stopped staring in a trance-like state and rushed from the mobulas. Unlike other unknown creatures they had defeated, evil fire mobula wasn't a monster they could overpower easily, not to mention there were so many coming right at the group.</p>

  <p>However, astonishingly, the mobulas were much faster than they expected. Splashing through the fluid lava, they drew closer and closer to the disciples.</p>

  <p>Running away from the mobulas, Luo Luo Zheng watched in awe as a wave of fire rushed past him and reached a disciple. A mobula suddenly sprang from under the lava, speeding to strike at the shocked victim.</p>

  <p>Sensing the danger, the disciple instinctively pulled out a shiny, golden saber from a sheath and began slashing at the monster without even turning to face the mobula. It all happened in the blink of an eye. As soon as the saber was drawn, the icy light reflected brilliantly, amazing the other disciples.</p>

  <p>"The successful blade intent!" Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help shouting excitedly. He knew that the successful blade intent was a top grade blade skill that could only be manipulated by powerful, talented people. He would have never expected that this disciple, who looked so fragile and weak, would be powerful enough to have the successful blade intent.</p>

  <p>With the screeching sound of metal meeting flesh and bone, they watched as the saber sliced into the evil fire mobula's body as easily as a hot knife cutting butter.</p>

  <p>The saber struck so swiftly that the mobula had no time to dodge or react.</p>

  <p>However, this giant, monstrous sea beast, was so massive that one strike was not enough. Although it wasn't a fatal strike, the pain was intolerable. The mobula instinctively turned sideways and whipped its demonic, barbed tail fiercely at the disciple.</p>

  <p>The disciple saw the lethal tail. Gathering all his strength in his arms, he lifted his saber up and brought it down on the mobula's vicious tail.</p>

  <p>As the saber hit the tail, there was a clunk sound.</p>

  <p>It rebounded, leaving the mobula's tail unharmed. Sparks flew as the saber collided with the tail as if metal hit metal.</p>

  <p>How hard was that tail? For a moment, the stunned group stood there.</p>

  <p>Their minds boggled by the scene before them. Seeing the successful blade intent was surprising enough, but seeing a gigantic fish that was able to withstand the hit of the saber? How could it be possible? If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes just now, the group wouldn't have believed it.</p>

  <p>As surprised as they were by the mobula's indescribably hard tail, if they stood there, as though numb, the group would face inescapable disaster from this intelligent monster. As the disciples stood there transfixed, watching the man's second cut fail, the mobula had gotten close enough to attack him with its tail.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, it would mean certain death if the mobula were to drag him down into the burning lava that would incinerate his flesh from his body.</p>

  <p>While the other disciples stood there dumbstruck, Luo Luo Zheng sensed the extreme danger and composed himself. Without hesitating, he pulled his Streamer Sword out and jumped high in the air as he raised his sword.</p>

  <p>The cold metal gleamed blindingly. As he came back down to the ground, he brought the Steamer Sword down, silently and swiftly onto the mobula tail in front of him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's blow struck nerve endings in the tail, leaving the evil fire mobula screeching in pain.</p>

  <p>The mobula let out an ear-piercing shriek, and its long body twisted as it dived under the lava.</p>

  <p>A piece of tail, once attached to the mobula, hung in the air for a moment before it crashed down onto the stone pillar.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until then that the disciple being attacked realized that Luo Luo Zheng had saved his life. He would be dead if not for Luo Luo Zheng. Not knowing how to express his gratitude, the disciple just stared at Luo Luo Zheng awestruck and full of gratitude.</p>
