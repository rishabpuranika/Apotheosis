  <p>
</p>

  <p>The current situation was extremely disadvantageous for both the Demon Night and Luo Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>The number of the Demon Night war lords at top level was lower than that of the ogre war lords, but because of the powerful individuals in the Demon Night, the overall strength of the Demon Night members was higher than the strength of the ogres.</p>

  <p>However, the sudden appearance of two ogre war sages put both the Demon Night and the human race at an absolute disadvantage.</p>

  <p>But even in such a situation, Luo Luo Zheng dared to berate the ogres in a brazen manner. Upon seeing that, all the living creatures wondered whether Luo Luo Zheng had gone crazy.</p>

  <p>The smiles on Colin's and Neil's faces gradually faded away. The smiles of the ogre war lords at top level also disappeared.</p>

  <p>Today could be considered the day of the ogres' showdown with other races.</p>

  <p>Since two ogre war sages had appeared in the Tower of Sin, the power of the ogres had greatly increased.</p>

  <p>Although the two ogre sacred places couldn't threaten the Demon Night's Heavenly Feather Sacred Place outside the Cursed Land, no race in the Tower of Sin could resist the ogres.</p>

  <p>"The superhuman talent, Luo Luo Zheng?" Separated by the crowd of Demon Night war lords, Colin let out a sinister laugh. "Do you think you can do anything you want just because you have the protection of the Demon Night? Or are your eyes so blinded by others that you're not able to see the situation unfold?"</p>

  <p>At this moment, even Esther and the other top-level war lords of the Demon Night had indignant expressions for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>They had no choice but to put their lives at risk to protect Luo Luo Zheng for their queen. Xun was still in the form of a sword spirit following Luo Luo Zheng around, but the current situation was completely out of control. Esther was wondering about the price they'd have to pay to protect Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After the words Luo Luo Zheng had just uttered, it was going to be very difficult for them to deal with this situation and wind this matter up.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the two ogre war sages meant that the authority over the Tower of Sin was in the hands of the ogres.</p>

  <p>Fabian secretly asked Jarrod through his life vitality, "What the hell is this guy doing? He shouldn't be such a stupid person!"</p>

  <p>"Could it be that Luo Luo Zheng has someone else to rely on?" Jarrod was also confused because he couldn't figure out the reason why Luo Luo Zheng was acting this way.</p>

  <p>Olivia was the only one who stared at Luo Luo Zheng with a gleam in her eyes. She was certain that Luo Luo Zheng had some kind of trump card up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>By now, she had already guessed that the appearance of the Demon Night named Xun was completely beyond Luo Zheng's expectation. But Xun wasn't Luo Zheng's trump card.</p>

  <p>So what was his real trump card? Could it be that his real trump card was so strong that Luo Luo Zheng wasn't even afraid of the ogre war sages?</p>

  <p>Olivia couldn't figure it out but she knew that there was no need for her to overthink it. She knew that Luo Luo Zheng could turn the situation around no matter what.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, don't spout nonsense!" For the sake of the Demon Night's queen, Esther controlled her temper and turned to the ogres. "Colin, Neil, I don't care how you entered the Tower of Sin. Luo Luo Zheng cannot be killed. If you dare to touch him, our Heavenly Feather Sacred Place definitely won't let you off.</p>

  <p>You should consider it clearly. I think there's still room for negotiation."</p>

  <p>"Esther, you probably haven't figured out the situation yet," Colin said lazily. "We just want that guy to die. No more negotiation! Then, I want to see how you're going to deal with our two ogre sacred places!"</p>

  <p>After Colin finished speaking, the forceful energy within Colin's and Neil's bodies erupted as they prepared to make their move.</p>

  <p>The Mu Ning of the two powerful ogre war sages was very fierce indeed.</p>

  <p>As their energy surged, the top-level war lords of the Demon Night became startled. It seemed that they wouldn't be able to avoid a battle with the ogres.</p>

  <p>So far, the Demon Night members hadn't been afraid of the ogres. But now, with the arrival of the two ogre war sages, the situation was completely different.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Luo Luo Zheng laughed again, pointing at the two ogre war sages. "It's a pity. Although the two of you are war sages and you've painstakingly entered the Tower of Sin, you're about to die right now!"</p>

  <p>A mixture of doubt and astonishment appeared on everyone's faces. Would Luo Luo Zheng really be able to deal with these two war sages?</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, do you know what you're talking about?" Esther asked.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded. "Of course!"</p>

  <p>"Do you really have confidence in dealing with the two war sages?" Esther asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng just smiled in response.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Xun was still standing indifferently by Luo Zheng's side, not saying a word. As she was in the form of the sword spirit, she was attached to Luo Zheng's body. She was aware of everything that Luo Luo Zheng had experienced at the Talent Tablet.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Luo Luo Zheng pointed at the two ogre war sages and said coldly, "Both of you, get out of the Tower of Sin!"</p>

  <p>Since Luo Luo Zheng had been accepted by the Celestial Position race, the weapon spirit naturally did as he said.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt an invisible wave appear in the space of the tenth floor.</p>

  <p>This wave didn't seem to come from any living being but from the Tower of Sin itself!</p>

  <p>At the same time, the wall at the side of the arena began to vibrate continuously before a huge crack appeared in the middle.</p>

  <p>Colin and Neil watched the scene in front of them with shocked expressions.</p>

  <p>It was true that they could stay in the Tower of Sin for a short period of time, but that didn't mean that they could resist the killing curse power of the Cursed Land. If they stepped into the Cursed Land, they would be killed instantly.</p>

  <p>If the wall split open, there would be nothing separating the Tower of Sin from the Cursed Land. And the moment Colin and Neil so much as set foot on the Cursed Land, they would die without a doubt.</p>

  <p>Even a master of the Soul Sea Realm would die if he set foot on the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>When Mist had returned to the Central Region as an immortal, he had been unable to enter the Cursed Land to obtain the important inheritance. This meant that even an immortal wouldn't be able to resist the power of the curse.</p>

  <p>So naturally, after seeing the crack in the wall, the two ogre war sages felt an ominous sense of foreboding and their hearts leaped to their throats.</p>

  <p>An invisible force swept past the heads of the crowd and, suddenly transforming into two giant hands, grabbed Colin and Neil and dragged them toward the crack.</p>

  <p>"What is this!"</p>

  <p>"Let go of me!"</p>

  <p>After being engulfed by the invisible force, the two ogre war sages continuously struggled against it in panic.</p>

  <p>A surge of forceful energy erupted from their bodies as they tried to break free from the pair of invisible hands.</p>

  <p>A war sage's strength could match up to that of a master of the Life and Death Realm in the Central Region. However, the two of them weren't able to break free from the grip of the large hands even though they were struggling with all their might.</p>

  <p>Many of the living creatures' faces were also filled with shock. If the war sages themselves weren't able to break free of the invisible force, the top-level war lords present definitely wouldn't be able to resist it.</p>

  <p>No wonder Luo Luo Zheng had a fearless expression on his face. He seemed to be manipulating the Tower of Sin!</p>

  <p>These races had been researching the Tower of Sin for a long time and they had thoroughly analyzed the characteristics of the various equipment inside the tower.</p>

  <p>Many living creatures believed that the Tower of Sin was actually a living being and had its own consciousness.</p>

  <p>This tower had absorbed the blood and corpses of countless warriors over the years. It had also devoured innumerable weapons.</p>

  <p>However, until now, no one had come into contact with the consciousness of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>Now, it seemed that not only had Luo Luo Zheng come into contact with the consciousness of the tower, but he had even received the recognition of that consciousness.</p>

  <p>It was also very likely that this mysterious occurrence was happening inside the Talent Tablet!</p>

  <p>Many creatures were able to come to this conclusion.</p>

  <p>In fact, their guesses were close to the fact. But even so, guessing the truth wasn't very meaningful. The Talent Tablet had been around for so many years, but how many warriors had been able to get their names placed on the first row? Except for Yolande and Luo Luo Zheng, there was no one else.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had even been admitted to the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>It wasn't an easily obtainable honor.</p>

  <p>The two invisible hands continued dragging the two ogre war sages toward the crack. As for Maurice, Malcom, and the other top-level ogre war lords, they could only watch in horror.</p>

  <p>At this point, there seemed to be nothing they could do.</p>

  <p>It would be fine if the two large hands were dragging two top-level war lords. They would be thrown out of the Tower of Sin, but they wouldn't be harmed at all if they entered the Cursed Land.</p>

  <p>However, once the war sages entered the Cursed Land, they would definitely die.</p>

  <p>Everyone held their breath as they watched the two ogre war sages being thrown out of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The entire tower was buried deep in the ground, so there were layers of soil outside of the tenth floor. The invisible large hands dragged the two war sages out of the tower and then continued to drag them upward.</p>

  <p>In the end, the war sages broke through the thick layer of earth and ended up on the surface.</p>

  <p>Colin and Neil stood by the side of the Tower of Sin and glanced at each other, fear and trepidation appearing on their faces.</p>

  <p>The two ogre war sages who had been extremely proud of themselves just moments ago now felt the God of Death slowly approaching them.</p>

  <p>"Charge in!"</p>

  <p>As long as they entered the Tower of Sin, they would still have a chance of survival. The power of the curse wouldn't appear instantly.</p>

  <p>With that thought, they activated all the forceful energy in their bodies and charged toward the door of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>The two giant guards at the door saw two blobs of light quickly approaching them. The power that exploded out of those lights was so massive that the guards didn't dare to stand by the door anymore. They hurriedly ran to the side and watched the scene unfold in front of them.</p>

  <p>Although Colin and Neil were moving at a high speed, many black spots had already appeared on the surface of their bodies.</p>
