<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Although Zheng had seen Chiyou's statue for many times, he had only seen Chiyou once.</p>

  <p>The Chiyou statue in front of him now was no different from those he had already seen before.</p>

  <p>'Now that both the Snake Goddess' and Chiyou's statues are here, does that mean Fuxi's and the Eastern Emperor's will be here as well?'</p>

  <p>As Zheng thought about this, Feng Ge gently tugged at his sleeve. Her eyes never left the statues, but it seemed as if she was focused on one of them? the statue that half knelt on the ground, with a sword in hand that pierced the ground. It was a statue of Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>"Why...Why is Father's statue here?" Feng Ge asked in a hushed tone.</p>

  <p>Zheng squinted his eyes as he scanned through the statues before him. For everything to make sense, the Divine Farmer's and the Yellow Thearch's statues should have been present too. However, Zheng had never seen them in person, so he could only wonder if their statues were here.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that the statue is not of Eastern Emperor Taiyi himself," Zheng told Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>"It's not Father?" Feng Ge asked, unconvinced that the statue was not her father.</p>

  <p>"Right." Zheng nodded.</p>

  <p>Since the Snake Goddess was willing to give Zheng the Six-Pattern Blood-storing Seed, she did not know of the Other Shore Key in the seed, which also meant that she had no clue about the existence of this temple either.</p>

  <p>It was likely that the temple had stood there for such a long time, that it had survived through a thousand chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>Naturally, it was impossible for Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Chiyou, Fuxi, or even the Snake Goddess, to set up their statues here inside this particular temple.</p>

  <p>"If this is not Father, who could it possibly be?" Feng Ge questioned, "What on earth is up with this temple?"</p>

  <p>She did not understand the origin of this round of chaos, leaving her pretty much in the dark to what was happening.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Zheng had learned a handful about the Other Shore and the chaotic eras from No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit. Aside from this, he had also studied the origin of human beings from the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>In fact, the human beings in the current round of the chaotic era, should not have existed at all. The fact was that they had been secretly and strategically placed there by the human beings from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess explained all of this to him, Zheng couldn't help but have too many questions.</p>

  <p>Why was the Snake Goddess born to be the Snake Goddess in the first place?</p>

  <p>Why was Fuxi born to be Fuxi?</p>

  <p>Moreover, why were the Yellow Thearch, the Divine Farmer, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Chiyou, and so on born to be themselves?</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw the statues standing in the hall, he suddenly had answers to all of his questions. It all made sense.</p>

  <p>What he understood was that the Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others had already existed in times of the 77th civilization. During that time, they were top masters of that era. But before they had finished the Finale Way, all of them entered the Other Shore and became human beings on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>So when the seeds of humans were planted into the new round of chaos, it was most likely that they had prioritized their own clones.</p>

  <p>The clones were born to have powerful bloodlines, which was what made them so precious. This was why the Snake Goddess founded Pear Hill, why the Yellow Emperor founded the Bearing race, and why Eastern Emperor Taiyi had won over all those humans in the world alone with a sword just to found the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the Eastern Emperor Taiyi here is the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi." Zheng gestured at the statue. "While your father might be his clone."</p>

  <p>Zheng was quite sure at this point, that this was the explanation for what happened.</p>

  <p>"How could that be possible?"</p>

  <p>Just as Feng Ge was about to ask more questions, the Moon Fire Slaves and the Nihility Spirits also rushed into the temple to see the statues for themselves.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe the temple was opened so easily!" said the human woman from the Nihility race, with shock in her tone.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang..."</p>

  <p>Just then, No. 12 Moon Fire Slave entered and headed straight towards the center of the hall without speaking a word.</p>

  <p>"Did you think you were quick?" the human woman sneered at the Moon Fire Slave. With just a wave of her hand, the blood in the red ball quickly solidified and turned into a chain that she swung towards No.12.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>As the chain rolled out at around a dozen feet, No. 13 stepped on it as if it were nothing. However, as if the chain were a living creature, it wrapped itself around No. 13's body and tightened its grip.</p>

  <p>A sharp pain went through No. 13's body and he winced in agony. While this was ongoing, No. 12 had arrived at the center of the hall.</p>

  <p>At the center of the hall stood an independent statue that resembled the one outside the temple. This statue looked down onto the square stone platform in front of it, over where a blue book was floating.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng and Feng Ge had entered the temple, their attention did not ever leave the statues. Because of this, they had completely disregarded the floating book that No. 12 had come for.</p>

  <p>"Hahaha..."</p>

  <p>No. 12 chuckled, sending out a cold expression.</p>

  <p>He did not realize the value of the entire temple like the Element Spirit race did.</p>

  <p>But No. 12 knew that bringing back something so valuable would get him promoted immediately. It was very likely that his status would jump from No. 12 to No.1.</p>

  <p>But just as the Moon Fire Slave reached out to grab the book, the statue that had been reading it suddenly raised its head.</p>

  <p>The statue took a long look at the Moon Fire Slave, and then a confused expression spread across its face. "This temple could only be opened by a human being," the statue said. "How could you enter here?"</p>

  <p>"That...is none of your business!" said No. 12, as he stretched out his hand to slap the statue. One slap could send a statue to pieces.</p>

  <p>However, No. 12 failed to recall the similar statue that stood outside the temple.</p>

  <p>If the statue could be destroyed so easily, the Nihility race and the Element Spirit race would have shattered it by now. However, the one outside still stood firm and undamaged.</p>

  <p>When No. 12 lifted his hand to slap the statue, the statue smiled. It then stretched out its finger and lightly tapped in the air.</p>

  <p>"Pop!"</p>

  <p>Just like that, a cracking noise echoed from inside the hall.</p>

  <p>No. 12's tall and sturdy body stiffened in fright.</p>

  <p>A spiritual core rolled out from his right shoulder, which turned into powder as it rolled down.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>The spiritual core was broken, which meant that the Moon Fire Slave was completely destroyed.</p>

  <p>His flaming body evaporated, leaving his armor clamoring as it fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"The spiritual core? The spiritual core is broken?" No. 13 that was watching their exchange couldn't help but be frightened.</p>

  <p>Historically, it was very difficult to kill a Moon Fire Slave.</p>

  <p>This was because their spiritual cores could not be destroyed just by ordinary means.</p>

  <p>The perfect example of this would be No. 14, who had "died" twice yet could revive himself with star dust.</p>

  <p>It was notable that the statue killed No. 12 so easily.</p>

  <p>But the statue didn't stop the killing after getting rid of No. 12. "Alien races are not allowed to enter the temple," it muttered.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, two invisible beams of light emerged from its fingers.</p>

  <p>As much as No. 13 wanted to run away, he did not have enough time to do so. The light pierced through his body and shattered the spiritual core inside. The Magical Star Flame that formed his body immediately extinguished.</p>

  <p>At the same time, another beam of light shot right into the body of a Nihility Spirit that was close by.</p>
