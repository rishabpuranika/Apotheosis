<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every living being throughout the entire divine land would eventually produce a Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>For centuries and centuries, countless living beings had been born into the divine land.</p>

  <p>Thus, the quantity of Memory Flames was absolutely unimaginable.</p>

  <p>There were so many in fact, that they formed an ocean of flames, floating in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>As soon as No. 9527 had finished explaining, a Memory Flame drifted towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Is a Memory Flame equivalent to a soul?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>The theory of reincarnation was very mysterious and unheard of. Zheng, on his behalf, was naturally very interested in knowing more.</p>

  <p>According to his current understanding, a reincarnation was the rebirth of one's soul, and that was why the memory of the previous life remained.</p>

  <p>"No," No. 9527 stated. "Your soul is only your memory's carrier. The Memory Flame is unique proof of a living being, which records a creature's entire life."</p>

  <p>"The soul would only be the carrier?" Zheng mumbled his question, deeply lost in his thoughts.</p>

  <p>Another Memory Flame, a purple one this time, hovered over to Zheng. He stretched out his hand and touched it gently with his fingertips.</p>

  <p>The Memory Flame had no tactile impression. His fingers brushed up against nothingness, as if it were just a weak spot of light.</p>

  <p>As he touched the Memory Flame, a strange feeling quickly spread from Zheng's finger, all the way up to his mind.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>In a split second, his mind was pulled into the Memory Flame and lost within.</p>

  <p>Countless pictures suddenly flashed in Zheng's mind one after the next, like a speeding slide show.</p>

  <p>It was actually a child's memory being displayed!</p>

  <p>The child was born into the Lie Clan.</p>

  <p>Three thousand Lie Clan children were sent to cultivate under a Godly Way Tablet, and this child was amongst them.</p>

  <p>The child's name was Rohan, and he was only four years old back when he was sent for cultivation. However, his talent in the Elementary Fire Godly Way field was unparalleled. Clearly, age wasn't a factor, at least not in this case.</p>

  <p>At the tender and young age of four, he had already become a proving godly warrior and was capable of obtaining the qualification for cultivating under the Elementary Fire Godly Way Tablet.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, this child was considered a Lie Clan treasure. He was very precious.</p>

  <p>"In one thousand years no less, our clan will definitely be welcoming a new Demi-holy Being!"</p>

  <p>"Our clan should recommend him to the Fang Clan and give him permission to cultivate on the Floating Island!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, with Rohan's help, of course, we'll be crowned as one of the more powerful clans on the Floating Islands!"</p>

  <p>The Lie Clan elders had high hopes for Rohan's future. And they had every reason to have such aspirations.</p>

  <p>Numerous pictures in the Memory Flame continued flashing in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>Zheng could understand all kinds of different emotions felt by this child throughout his lifetime, from his pride to fear, sorrow to happiness...</p>

  <p>And even the child's comprehension of the Elementary Fire Godly Way!</p>

  <p>"Such a comprehension is incredibly helpful when it comes to cultivation," Zheng muttered to himself, as his heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>A warrior's cultivation was based on constant, deliberate comprehension.</p>

  <p>The Memory Flame had recorded Rohan's unique perception of the Elementary Fire Godly Way. Feeling it all in this way, through his entire body, was almost equal to cultivating the Godly Way by oneself!</p>

  <p>In fact, the effect was even better than most people's self-cultivation!</p>

  <p>After all, it was safe to say that the majority of the warriors in the divine land were mediocre. Only very few talents like Rohan existed here.</p>

  <p>Although this kind of experience wasn't necessarily of much use to Zheng, to other True Gods, it was simply a source of unimaginable cultivation resources.</p>

  <p>If it were possible for anyone else to come here and regularly read the Memory Flames in order to inherit experience about cultivation through memories, their cultivation base would improve greatly with half the effort.</p>

  <p>Every single Memory Flame contained a warrior's complete and rich experience about cultivation. This place was completely loaded with Memory Flames!</p>

  <p>If one could make full use of the Memory Flames, their cultivation speed would improve to a never-before-seen level, their powers horribly strong. A proving godly warrior might even be capable of becoming a top rank True God or even attaining the consummation of True God Realm in a short time.</p>

  <p>"The Elementary Fire Godly Way," Zheng said at once. "The crux is the fire's flexibility. Everyone and anyone who cultivates this Godly Way should remain calm and concentrated..." he continued.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was trying to pry deeper into Rohan's cultivation memory, the continuous images from the child's memory suddenly stopped without warning!</p>

  <p>The very last image that Zheng saw was a white saber cutting Rohan's neck.</p>

  <p>"Dad, I've been murdered by... My uncle!" This was the last message Rohan had sent out using his soul power before he died and these were the very last words Zheng heard Rohan speak.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>When Zheng was finished reading the child's memories, Rohan's Memory Flame slowly drifted away, bobbing up and down into the distance.</p>

  <p>He sighed in pity as he stared at the Memory Flame. He just couldn't take his eyes off it.</p>

  <p>Rohan was obviously a great talent, one of a kind even. He had died so young though, he wasn't even ten.</p>

  <p>The little boy had been savagely murdered by his uncle, which was the result of the Lie Clan disputes.</p>

  <p>From the Memory Flame however, Zheng didn't feel any resentment coming from the child. After all, Rohan was only a gifted and innocent child. Despite being killed by his own uncle, the little boy didn't appear resentful.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but wonder what had happened to the Lie Clan after such a passing.</p>

  <p>What Zheng didn't know was that the Lie Clan actually used to be a first-tier clan with a strong population in the northern part of the divine land.</p>

  <p>That, however, didn't last.</p>

  <p>Certain warriors would even say that the Lie Clan was only inferior to the largest clans of the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>The Lie Clan had two Demi-holy Beings guarding them, and at the time, it might have been one of the most powerful clans, with the possibility of owning a Floating Island in the more recent divine eras.</p>

  <p>Rohan's tragedy had triggered a series of strife in the clan instead, sending them spindling down a different turn of events.</p>

  <p>Their clan leader had been assassinated, and all clan members of one main branch had equally been killed. In the end, both Demi-holy Beings ended up fighting against each other, raising hell. Both of them were wounded greatly in the battle and still hadn't regained their full strength back.</p>

  <p>Slowly but surely, Rohan's Memory Flame drifted further and further away from Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng stuck out his finger in order to touch another Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Zheng knew what to expect this time around. The second his finger connected with the flame, his mind was immediately absorbed whole.</p>

  <p>This Memory Flame belonged to a divine citizen in a remote mountain village. There wasn't anything special to be discovered in this person's memory.</p>

  <p>This divine citizen had never left the mountain he called home in his entire life. He hadn't even entered a divine City. Ultimately, he found himself involved in a war among the clans and died.</p>

  <p>Zheng was highly concentrated on reading the memories. He wasn't paying attention to anything else going on around him.</p>

  <p>As his mind was lost in yet another Memory Flame, a cunning glint hastily flashed in the Stone Mouse's eyes.</p>

  <p>The Stone Mouse looked off into the distance.</p>

  <p>Different people's Memory Flames were divided into different levels.</p>

  <p>The longer a person lived, the more they remembered, and thus, the brighter their Memory Flames would be.</p>

  <p>A few True Gods lived for dozens of divine eras, and their memories were countless times larger than those of an ordinary warrior. Such a True God had lived and experienced so much more.</p>

  <p>Beneath the Stone Mouse's control, certain bright Memory Flames out in the ocean of countless light spots slowly moved toward Zheng!</p>

  <p>Zheng, of course, didn't take any notice because he was still reading the Memory Flames surrounding him.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, most people's memories were very boring and had no interest to him whatsoever.</p>

  <p>After all, the majority of the people living in the divine land were ordinary divine citizens. They had led an ordinary and peaceful life, and had never practiced cultivation at all. What they wanted, and what they had obtained, was a stable and carefree life.</p>

  <p>Without the Godly Ways' power, they had no infinite longevity. After their lifespans reached their ends, they quietly died in a corner of the divine land without saying a word or bothering anyone.</p>

  <p>"This Memory Flame's owner died in the Soul Wilderness!" Zheng stated to himself in surprise.</p>

  <p>The Memory Flame that he inadvertently fell upon was from a consummate True God of the Mu Clan.</p>

  <p>This man had explored the Soul Wilderness a whole fifteen divine eras ago. Back then, Estelle hadn't controlled the Soul Wilderness yet.</p>

  <p>The man eventually died in a fierce competition within the forbidden land.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng snapped out from the Memory Flame, the Stone Mouse's eyes were quick to gleam with cunningness.</p>

  <p>At the same time, No. 9527's consciousness sent him a message, "Zheng!</p>

  <p>Watch out!"</p>

  <p>In the ocean of Memory Flames, countless bright Memory Flames were gathered into a river. Out of nowhere, the river flow began to speed up and it was headed directly for Zheng!</p>
