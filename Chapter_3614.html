<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Once light and dark ceased to replace each other, the sealing finally concluded.</p>

  <p>"Is this to test one's state of mind?" Zheng asked. The Buddha nodded in affirmation.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Zheng tilted his head in curiosity. "Am I supposed to break the seal in five minutes?"</p>

  <p>The Buddha nodded once again. "If that is what you wish."</p>

  <p>"Alright then."</p>

  <p>Zheng prepared himself by taking a deep breath before he began to concentrate his mind and energy on the task at hand.</p>

  <p>He was literally trapped in his own mind and everything was happening in his head, but that did not mean that the world around him was not real.</p>

  <p>A benefit of his current situation, however, was being able to do whatever he wanted.</p>

  <p>"Mind Sword!" he called from within him. "Break!"</p>

  <p>As Zheng's mind shouted his command, long swords suddenly materialized beside him.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack</p>

  <p>His swords, borne from his own will, flew out and shattered the Buddha statues that once covered the land. With the statues gone, the world around him began to crumble.</p>

  <p>Like a huge illusory curtain, Zheng's swords had split the world open, tearing it apart in order to reveal another, newer world underneath.</p>

  <p>"The swordsmanship that is used to mainly cultivate the state of mind was inherited from the Starry Sword Region," the Buddha told him in a calm, enlightened voice. Zheng raised an eyebrow at the mention of the technique's origin.</p>

  <p>"The Starry Sword Region?" he repeated. He then remembered the Oneness Sky Palace and its ruler. "Is that region ruled by Eastern Emperor Taiyi?"</p>

  <p>"The one and only," the Buddha confirmed. "However, I'm afraid it's going to be too difficult to break the mental prison with just this cultivation method. Though your state of mind is sharp, it is not enough."</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't help but scoff in amusement. "Really? I don't find it difficult to destroy this world though."</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>As soon as he said that, a loud explosion reverberated all around them as the long swords from before shot out and shattered everything. When the old world fell, another took its place.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>It was a constant state of creation and destruction as Zheng continued to shatter the thirteen worlds that surrounded his mind.</p>

  <p>At this rate, five minutes would be more than enough for him to pass the Buddha's test.</p>

  <p>On the fourteenth world, Zheng summoned his swords once again but the number he was able to conjure was noticeably less. When he launched his attack, the world did not shatter and only cracked in a few places.</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned and willed himself to try again. "Mind Sword! Shatter!"</p>

  <p>A gentle, understanding smile appeared on the Buddha's face. "You're tired."</p>

  <p>Zheng's state of mind was sharp, but his strength turned out to also be his boon. His mind was too sharp that it consumed a large amount of mental strength, which lessened his endurance.</p>

  <p>As the Buddha said, Zheng felt tired. "There is no standard for the cultivation of mental strength. I'm afraid I can't cultivate it," he sighed.</p>

  <p>The cultivation of the state of mind was mysterious and it was all up to one's own comprehension.</p>

  <p>"You don't know how to cultivate it but that doesn't mean you can't. I can teach you an omnipotent Buddha theurgy to enlighten you if you want," the Buddha said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes flashed at the Buddha's offer. "An omnipotent Buddha theurgy?"</p>

  <p>These thirty-nine heroes were once considered the strongest figures in the past chaotic era.</p>

  <p>Though he did not know the Buddha's real name, Zheng knew that he was still considered a master in Buddha Region. His theurgy was no doubt unparalleled.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this a test?" Zheng asked. "Why are you offering to teach me?" It didn't make that much sense to him. Why offer a lesson in the middle of a practical test?</p>

  <p>"Whether it's a test or not depends on your own perception," the Buddha vaguely explained. "Fate brought us together so there is no need for me to test you."</p>

  <p>That explanation wasn't enough to clear all of Zheng's apprehensions. This test was completely different from what he imagined.</p>

  <p>As he thought it through, the Buddha began to speak.</p>

  <p>A series of strange words reached Zheng's ears but since he was trapped in his mind, he couldn't really hear anything.</p>

  <p>However, even if his ears weren't working, he still felt that soft pressure in his mind.</p>

  <p>"These words..."</p>

  <p>They were all meaningless but they were connected to each other since they had such a profound effect on him. Zheng couldn't help but compare them to Sanskrit words as the pressure continued to build in his mind.</p>

  <p>When the Buddha ceased his chanting, the pressure had reached its peak and he felt a warm feeling flood through his head. The fatigue that previously plagued him was long gone and he felt extremely relaxed.</p>

  <p>"Mind Sword!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>"Mind Sword!"</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>He was now back to shattering the worlds in one strike. If he felt himself getting tired, Zheng merely activated the mind method that the Buddha just taught him.</p>

  <p>In no time at all, Zheng had broken through all the sealed worlds and passed the Buddha's test. On top of that, he even learned an omnipotent theurgy!</p>

  <p>To say he was happy was an understatement.</p>

  <p>Zheng, however, couldn't help but be curious. "What's the name of this mind method? How does it have such a miraculous effect?"</p>

  <p>"It is named the Buddha Mind Method and if you use it in reverse, it can trap your opponents in mental prisons," the Buddha answered.</p>

  <p>Zheng cupped his hands in respect. "Thank you! May I have your name?"</p>

  <p>His reply was a mere smile. The Buddha calmly pushed him away and put distance between Zheng and the Buddha Region.</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was convinced he was never going to find out this master's name, he heard a voice mumble softly in his head. "My name is Tathagata."</p>

  <p>"Tathagata..."</p>

  <p>Zheng repeated the name to himself, intending to keep it with him as he flew into the void.</p>

  <p>In the 77th chaotic era, the Buddha Region might have very well been a powerful force.</p>

  <p>To Zheng, since the 77th civilization had been dominated by humans, then that must mean it was much better than the current chaotic era.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was much more complicated than he had first imagined.</p>

  <p>As Zheng flew, he was once again enveloped by new scenery.</p>

  <p>He found himself a star. Zheng landed on it and saw a man with incredibly delicate and graceful features. He was so handsome that he could even be considered more beautiful than most women.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" Zheng asked. The handsome man gave him a shining smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm Emperor Charm."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes immediately widened. "Emperor Charm?!" The emperor nodded and waved his hand dismissively.</p>

  <p>"You can go. I don't have any test for you."</p>

  <p>His nonchalance took Zheng aback. "You don't have any test for me?"</p>

  <p>Wasn't the whole point of being here to let these human heroes test and recognize him?</p>

  <p>Zheng did not immediately do as he said. He merely stood there and stared at the emperor of the Sun Crow race before opening his mouth. "Emperor Charm, did all of you have the same goal back then?"</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm tilted his head in curiosity. "What goal?"</p>

  <p>"Changing the fate of the chaos and realizing the Finale Way," Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm let out a charming laugh that sounded like light, chiming bells on a sunny day. "Of course we had the same goal!"</p>

  <p>"It's a pity that the Emperor Charm in the current round of chaos has chosen the opposite way."</p>

  <p>The laughter died on Emperor Charm's throat after he heard what Zheng just said.</p>

  <p>The Emperor Charm in the current round of chaos had inherited everything of him: talent, personality, bloodline, and even theurgies. However, at the end of the day, he remained his own person and even the real Emperor Charm had no power over him.</p>

  <p>"I see."</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm waved his hand, summoning a gust of wind that blew Zheng away.</p>
