  <p>
</p>

  <p>Saul's words were confusing, and Yudie's face filled with astonishment.</p>

  <p>In just four years, Luo Zheng had advanced from a nature level warrior to a Life and Death Realm warrior. Yet Saul was saying that his cultivation speed was still not enough.</p>

  <p>Such a fast pace of breaking through could be considered extremely rare.</p>

  <p>At least in Yudie's knowledge, among all the years she had spent in the Central Region, she had never seen a person talented enough to have achieved such a fast speed.</p>

  <p>Just how high were this man's standards?</p>

  <p>However, what Saul said next made Ning Yudie more shocked. He sighed and told Luo Zheng, "And yes. I can see that although you are only at the Life and Death Realm, your foundation is much more stable than ordinary warriors. In fact, I know that your strength is comparable to a Soul Sea Realm warrior. But it is still not enough. You cannot break through the barrier to the True Path at this level, nor can you walk on it. Although I have some regrets, you still need to cultivate for a few years before coming back."</p>

  <p>'Not enough?' Ning Yudie thought, speechless. Was this place still in the Eastern Region? Even a Life and Death Realm warrior was not qualified to pass through. What sort of legacy did this fairy palace have?</p>

  <p>Hearing Saul's words, Luo Zheng did not seem to be dejected at all. Instead, he smiled and asked, "What if I have this token?"</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, he took out the other token from his space ring.</p>

  <p>On the token in his hand was carved the word "thunder."</p>

  <p>This token had been given to Luo Zheng by Immortal Mist, who himself had suffered the Five Aging Processes. It had left him with only a strand of his remnant soul. If he had held onto this token, it would have been of no use, so he had given it to Luo Zheng as a gift, telling him that with this token, he could activate the True Path.</p>

  <p>This fairy palace was of great importance. Before ascending to the Upper World, Luo Zheng was going to try his best to control the fairy palace. To do so, he had to cross the true path. It was impossible to do so without that.</p>

  <p>Saul looked at the token in Zheng's hand, and remarked in a calm voice,</p>

  <p>"That's Mist's token. I guess he's passed away now. I didn't expect him to give his token to you. Yes, with this token, you can enter the True Path without breaking the barrier. However, with your strength, even if you were to enter the True Path, you would probably not be able to pass through the first stage."</p>

  <p>"What's the benefit of passing the first stage?" Luo Zheng asked and his eyes lit up at the prospect.</p>

  <p>Saul replied, "There are a total of eight tokens in the fairy palace— heaven, earth, water, fire, thunder, wind, mountain and valley. Other than the 'heaven' and 'earth' tokens, it is possible for you to obtain the other six tokens. These two, I fear are beyond you."</p>

  <p>"Six tokens? But I already have two of them; one with the word 'thunder' and the other with the word 'wind.' What if I end up with a token with the same word?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>Saul smiled, "This will depend on your luck. There are no two ways about it."</p>

  <p>A look of helplessness appeared on Zheng's face as he asked, "And what's the use of obtaining the other tokens?"</p>

  <p>Hearing this question, Saul waved his hand and pointed towards the entrance. "With the token of wind, you will be able to enter and leave the fairy palace at will, just like you did this time. With the token of thunder, you can enter the True Path. With the token of valley, you can enter the pill refining workshop. The token of fire allows you to enter the weapon refining workshop. With the token of water, you can enter the library.</p>

  <p>With the token of mountain..."</p>

  <p>Like a tape recorder, Saul told Luo Zheng the use of every single token. Only after hearing his response did Luo Zheng fully understand that mastering these six tokens actually allowed him to gradually control everything in this fairy palace. However, each token could only correspond to one thing.</p>

  <p>And if he had two of the same, it wouldn't make any difference.</p>

  <p>He didn't know why the first master of this fairy palace had set it up in such a manner. This was truly making things difficult for anyone who entered the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>When he thought of this, Luo Zheng spoke again. "Hang on. That's only six.</p>

  <p>What's the use of the tokens of heaven and earth?"</p>

  <p>Saul smiled and replied, "When you've gathered the first six tokens, you can ask me again. I won't tell you about it now."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged his shoulders. He knew Saul well enough. Whatever he was unwilling to answer, he would not answer no matter how many times he was asked. In any case, Luo Zheng had made up his mind. He would definitely enter the True Path. Back then, when he had first entered the fairy palace, he had only obtained one thing— the Sun Moon Stars Picture.</p>

  <p>As for the weapon refining workshop, the pill refining workshop, the library and so on, he didn't even know how to enter them until now. Yet even at his current level of strength, he wouldn't be able to force his way in.</p>

  <p>Now that Luo Zheng was ready to ascend to the Upper World, there was no way for him to retreat.</p>

  <p>"Is the True Path dangerous?" Mu Ning asked in a concerned tone. She knew clearly that even if there was danger up ahead, Luo Zheng would not cower back in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Saul replied, "That depends on Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>The bigger the reward, the greater the risk. It was the same as Zheng's every adventure. If there were no risk, wouldn't everyone be able to obtain the reward without any effort? What good would that be?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was just about to let Saul guide him into the True Path when a thought suddenly flashed through his mind. "I passed the trial last time.</p>

  <p>Can they also participate in the trial?"</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had her own cultivation method, and the creature she had visualized was the ice phoenix. However, that did not mean that the Contemplation Pictures in the fairy palace were useless to Ning Yudie, Mu Ning or Mu Ning. If the three of them could enter the fairy palace to train, it would be of great use to them, and even better for them if they managed to obtain their own Contemplation Pictures.</p>

  <p>Saul nodded and replied, "Yes, they can. But they won't be able to get any token."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the current owner of the fairy palace, and only he was qualified to obtain tokens. The previous owner of the fairy palace was Immortal Mist. When Luo Zheng had entered the fairy palace, Immortal Mist had already suffered the Five Aging Processes, and was, in fact, already a dead man, left with nothing but a strand of his soul. And now, no one else was qualified to gain the recognition of the fairy palace unless Luo Zheng died.</p>

  <p>"Okay. Got it." Luo Zheng nodded his head cautiously as he turned around to look at the three women. He had asked for an answer from Saul, but he also didn't know if the three women would agree to accept the trial.</p>

  <p>As expected, the three women had different reactions to the idea.</p>

  <p>When Ning Yudie found out about the opportunities that lay within the trial, she became very excited. As the leader of the Cloud Hall, she was as outstanding as she had always been and was also fearless of any trial or challenge that came her way.</p>

  <p>As for Mu Ning, there was a trace of uncertainty on her face. Among the three women, her cultivation level was the lowest and she was only at the fourth grade of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Although she was willing to participate in the trial, she lacked the confidence that she had the strength to pass it. However, Saul told her that the difficulty of this trial would be adjusted according to one's cultivation level.</p>

  <p>Finally, there was Mu Ning. She was currently in a conflicted state of mind. Her cultivation level right now was at the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>However, if she did not use the power of the Purple Power World, she would probably be no match even for Mu Ning. Her cultivation had been built up through resources. Her foundation was weak and unstable.</p>

  <p>"Can I borrow some external force?" Mu Ning asked.</p>

  <p>Saul sized up Mu Ning and replied, "You seem to have the Sky Purple Body. There are hidden space nodes in your body, and you can connect to the outside world." Then he shook his head and added, "But no. It's impossible to borrow external force in here."</p>

  <p>Purple Power Body had a different name in Saul's mouth. Mu Ning did not care about the Sky Purple Body at all. Since she could not borrow any external force, she might as well skip the trial. With her current strength, she would probably not be able to pass the trial.</p>

  <p>When she chose to give up, even Luo Zheng had no way of convincing her.</p>

  <p>Right now, under Saul's lead, Ning Yudie and Mu Ning were the first to undergo the trial.</p>

  <p>The trial didn't last long. An hour later, the two women both passed easily.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie looked calm and relaxed, while Mu Ning looked completely in contrast to that. Even after she had left the illusion world, her face was still as pale as a sheet. It was only after Luo Zheng gave her a pill to calm her down that she finally relaxed.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had obtained the Cloud and Flying Birds Picture from her trial, which was only second to the Sun Moon Stars Picture.</p>

  <p>Her talent and strength were already extremely strong, so obtaining this result was not surprising. As for Mu Ning, her result was extremely surprising. She had actually obtained the third picture, the Nine-day Cycle Picture.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Ning Yudie and Mu Ning had obtained their own Contemplation Pictures, Mu Ning felt a little jealous in her heart. But she still knew her own limits. If it weren't for her Purple Power Body, she would be the weakest among the three women. She swore to herself that she would cultivate harder in the Apeiron Tower in the future so that Ning Yudie and Mu Ning would not look down upon her.</p>

  <p>After the two women passed the trial, Saul led Luo Zheng towards the True Path. They walked along a long, narrow road, until finally, before them appeared a pale yellow wall.</p>
