  <p>
</p>

  <p>In Hardy's opinion, this anonymous man was quite powerful.</p>

  <p>Even if he put aside the man's ability to instantly comprehend his Godly Way during their battle, he judged that the man was much stronger than the low-rank True Gods who had just proved the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>But regardless of the anonymous man's abilities, he was still only a proving godly warrior. Hardy was already in a bad mood after losing to him, but his mood worsened when the other low-rank True Gods surrounded him and kept annoying him with questions. Even though he was a straightforward and simple-minded man, he was willing to watch them lose their points to the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>As he had expected, the group of True Gods relaxed upon hearing his words.</p>

  <p>Then, they began to chide Hardy for his carelessness as if they were superior to him.</p>

  <p>"How could you be so careless?"</p>

  <p>"No matter how weak the opponent is, you should always keep vigilant!"</p>

  <p>"You've lost to a mere proving godly warrior. I hope you learned your lesson. Hey, hey, wait for me..."</p>

  <p>After saying a few perfunctory words to Hardy, the True Gods rushed to Zheng's door. They didn't want to miss the chance to beat a proving godly warrior. For them, it seemed like an easy way to gain points.</p>

  <p>As a result, the few True Gods swarmed in front of Zheng's door, blocking it completely.</p>

  <p>Seeing this group of fellows rushing toward Zheng's door, the other low-rank True Gods had puzzled expressions on their faces. However, it was only when Zheng opened the door that they realized that there was a proving godly warrior who had begun to challenge warriors above his level. As a result, more low-rank True Gods went up to Zheng's door. They all thought that they could beat this proving godly warrior and earn easy points.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Zheng was shocked to see so many low-rank True Gods gathered in front of his door. He glared at them and asked, "What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>"Quick, accept my challenge!"</p>

  <p>"I'm even weaker than Hardy. Maybe you can also defeat me!"</p>

  <p>"Choose me..."</p>

  <p>These low-rank True Gods all eagerly tried to lure Zheng into choosing them to challenge next.</p>

  <p>Zheng rolled his eyes, and then suddenly realized that these people couldn't see his expression as he was still in an anonymous state.</p>

  <p>According to Joy, as long as he won consecutively without losing any battles, it would be easy for him to amass a large number of points. So, it was actually a good thing for him that so many people were enthusiastically waiting to challenge him. He could pick them one by one and defeat them.</p>

  <p>After all, these guys were the weakest of the low-rank True Gods. Some of them had just proved the Godly Ways and their Godly Tiles were not stable yet, so naturally, they couldn't exert their full strength. Otherwise, they wouldn't be picking on a proving godly warrior for the sake of points. However, with Zheng's current ability, it would be a piece of cake for him to defeat them.</p>

  <p>But on second thought, Zheng found the whole commotion a little strange and realized that he was being too optimistic.</p>

  <p>These guys were clamoring to challenge Zheng only because they didn't know his real strength yet. Once they discovered that Zheng was not as weak as they thought, how would they be willing to battle Zheng?</p>

  <p>What Zheng didn't know was that there were many limits placed on face-to-face challenges in order to prevent warriors of the same clan from getting points by cheating. A warrior could obtain many points if they won consecutive battles, so as long as they picked rivals that they knew they could defeat, they could keep gaining points. For example, if a True God of the Han Clan kept defeating another True God of the same clan, then the former would keep gaining points.</p>

  <p>The Arena of Legends had been around for many years, and it had been continuously refined to remove such large loopholes in the rules.</p>

  <p>According to the current rules, a warrior could not challenge the same opponent in a row. On top of that, a warrior was not allowed to challenge an opponent whose ranking was 100 places higher or lower than themselves.</p>

  <p>It was natural for a warrior's ranking to constantly change as long as they participated in battles. Sometimes, when they won or lost a match, their ranking could instantly rise hundreds or even thousands of places. With this constant change in their rankings, it was difficult for them to cheat.</p>

  <p>However, no matter how refined the rules were, it was impossible to prevent warriors from cheating. Some of the powerful clans and some of the weak clans would secretly reach an agreement and concede to each other. When the disciples of the two clans that had reached an agreement encountered each other, one of them would choose to admit defeat according to the agreement. Outside the Arena of Legends, of course, the winner would give a lot of monetary compensation to the loser. This was equal to purchasing points with money.</p>

  <p>Whatever it was, Zheng thought that he could easily earn points for now, so he had no reason to turn down any of the challenges that came his way.</p>

  <p>He randomly pointed at one of the low-rank True Gods gathered in front of his door and said, "I challenge you!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was referring to a low-rank True God whose skin was green. He didn't know what kind of bloodline this True God had, but he looked like a zombie with a very terrifying appearance.</p>

  <p>The True God felt lucky to be chosen by Zheng. He immediately rushed down to his own room and launched a challenge against Zheng.</p>

  <p>The rest of the low-rank True Gods remained in front of Zheng's room so that they could track its location when his door changed its position once the battle was over.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, Zheng's door frame flashed blue.</p>

  <p>"It's over. It's over. Is it my turn this time?"</p>

  <p>"I've been waiting for him for such a long time. Why is it your turn now?"</p>

  <p>"No need to scramble. Let's take turns..."</p>

  <p>Just as everyone was arguing over who would go next, the blue light once again flew upwards.</p>

  <p>All of the people who were fighting to challenge Zheng were stunned.</p>

  <p>"He...he won again?"</p>

  <p>"The proving godly warrior won twice in a row against low-rank True Gods..."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it wasn't because of luck this time!"</p>

  <p>"This guy isn't as simple as he seems!"</p>

  <p>These low-rank True Gods were not idiots.</p>

  <p>When Hardy had been defeated by Zheng, they had all believed that, just as he had said, he had lost to Zheng only because of his own complacency.</p>

  <p>So, they had all chalked up Zheng's first victory against a low-rank True God to sheer luck. But now, he had defeated a second low-rank True God. Was it still luck?</p>

  <p>Hardy, who was standing nearby and watching them, secretly felt a bit relieved when he saw the expressions on their faces.</p>

  <p>'This anonymous man is really something else. Perhaps he can break the record. I have to tell my clan about this, ' Hardy thought. Although he was upset that he lost twice in a row, he had collected a piece of valuable news.</p>

  <p>Thus, after returning to his own room, Hardy left the Jade Wall of Legends. Then, he reported the news to the Qin Clan.</p>

  <p>This news immediately piqued the interest of some of the seniors of the Qin Clan. In all the wealthy clans, there were a few warriors who specialized in the analysis of the rankings on the Jade Wall of Legends and predicting future changes. Some of them could even remember all the names and rankings on the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>After hearing this new piece of information from Hardy, the Qin Clan sent someone to investigate the identity of the anonymous man, but they couldn't find any clues about him.</p>

  <p>"That anonymous man is definitely not a normal proving godly warrior as he dares to challenge low-rank True Gods. Only the top ten of the proving godly warriors have the qualifications to fight against warriors at higher levels. However, the top ten proving godly warriors haven't fought against anyone for a long time!" a senior of the Qin Clan said, staring at the Jade Wall of Legends.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that he has never lost a match?" another senior of the Qin Clan speculated.</p>

  <p>"That is indeed a possibility. It would explain why we can't determine his identity. If the anonymous man has never lost a challenge among the proving godly warriors, then his ranking would never have been calculated. As of now, he doesn't have a ranking among the low-rank True Gods as well."</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha, I don't know which little boy could be so radical. It's just two consecutive wins. Just keep paying attention to him."</p>

  <p>In addition to the Qin Clan, there were also a few other powerful clans that were keeping an eye on Zheng. It was likely that they had all come to the same conclusion.</p>

  <p>After Zheng defeated the second low-rank True God, he gained 75 points for his victory as well as an extra reward for his consecutive win, which was another 75 points. Thus, he obtained a total of 150 points. It was true that he could gain a lot of points by challenging True Gods, but only if he managed not to lose any battles.</p>

  <p>But despite his victory, Zheng looked a little upset when he reached his room. Shaking his head, he thought to himself, 'I risked so much but I couldn't activate the Infinity Ruler. It's a pity that I couldn't absorb his internal momentum. The Infinity Ruler is really hard to use.'</p>

  <p>When Zheng opened his door again, there were still countless low-rank True Gods waiting outside his door, but this time, many of them had cautious expressions in their eyes.</p>

  <p>They knew that Zheng had to have more than just luck on his side now that he had won two battles against low-rank True Gods in a row. This anonymous man must have unusual strength.</p>

  <p>"Hey, do you want to challenge me?" Zheng's voice sounded again from his blurry face.</p>

  <p>The True Gods who had been relentlessly arguing with one another to challenge Zheng now fell silent all of a sudden. They were all secretly considering Zheng's true strength.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds of silence, one of them finally decided to take the risk. "I...I challenge you!"</p>

  <p>"I'll wait for you!"</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled and went back into his room.</p>

  <p>After he closed the door of his room, the True Gods gathered outside fell into a dilemma. If this fellow's strength was ordinary, then wouldn't this be a chance for them to gain points?</p>

  <p>However, they didn't have to think about it long this time. After just 90 seconds, the door of Zheng's room flashed blue and then shot upwards.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's door soaring up again, these True Gods found themselves at a loss for words.</p>
