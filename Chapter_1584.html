<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1584 Rolling Stones </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Had this been an ordinary rock then the ten people on the scene wouldn't have even batted an eyelash.</p>

  <p>Moreover, even if it was thirty feet tall, it wouldn't even be enough to cause any sort of damage to the sword spirit - of course, that was if it had been an ordinary rock.</p>

  <p>But it wasn't. It was a huge stone in the middle of the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>There was surely more to it than met the eye.</p>

  <p>The fact that they could not destroy this stone was surely going to give them a headache.</p>

  <p>The human warrior who controlled the sword spirit gently shook the long sword which signaled the spirit to retreat.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>There was a loud explosion as the giant stone rolled to the side and smashed into the air, causing the entire Hall of Causality to tremble.</p>

  <p>The stone continued to roll and followed the sword spirit's path of retreat.</p>

  <p>Its speed had now exceeded the sword spirit's dodging speed. The warrior saw this and smiled.</p>

  <p>His long sword shook once again and the blue sword spirit suddenly transformed and split into seven to eight blue swords!</p>

  <p>The swords scattered in all directions before eventually coming together again and turning into a human-shaped figure. "The second hall isn't that difficult," the warrior said.</p>

  <p>He was confident that he'd be able to pass through this hall easily.</p>

  <p>However, just as the huge block of stone rolled down, one of its sides was revealed to them.</p>

  <p>It was a ghost face and it looked extremely ferocious! It had dark eyes, sharp teeth, and an evil smile. The smile gave chills to anyone who looked at it.</p>

  <p>The stone seemed to possess a certain level of intelligence since it was able to identify the controller of the sword spirit.</p>

  <p>This sentient block of stone was thirty feet long and thirty feet wide.</p>

  <p>Each time it rolled, it would do so at an extremely fast rate. Given the rather limited space, it had no problems crossing the entire hall and arriving in front of the human warrior. However, the warrior remained calm.</p>

  <p>Despite looking so formidable, this stone could only roll in a limited space. The entire floor of this hall was divided into several squares in a sort of grid pattern. Whenever it rolled, it did so according to the grid pattern that was on the ground and it could only roll either to the front, left, or right.</p>

  <p>Rolling diagonally meant it would first have to roll to the left, and then forward.</p>

  <p>The warrior's figure flashed as he moved towards the inclined top of the stone. The stone could only roll to the side and try to press down on him.</p>

  <p>However, before it could do that, the warrior's figure flashed again and evaded the stone's roll. It was obvious that he was playing with it now.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The bangs continued as the warrior continued evading the stone. He took advantage of its inability to move diagonally and maintained a slanted position on the grid pattern. "If you guys do as I do and maintain a diagonal position against the stone then passing this second hall won't be a problem!"</p>

  <p>His words were quickly taken note of by his party members. They would have to exercise constant vigilance if they wanted to keep their lives in here.</p>

  <p>A split second of carelessness would be enough for the stones to crush them.</p>

  <p>"If that's the case then we should get through this hall quickly," one of the warriors said, rushing into the hall. The moment he entered, two giant stones rolled over and followed him. Janet, who watched this, tutted in disapproval.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, quickly noticing the frown on Janet's face.</p>

  <p>"Something's wrong. The second hall's difficulty shouldn't be this low," she said. Ever since the beginning, she had emphasized the importance of teamwork if they wanted to get past the Hall of Causality. It wouldn't be good if so many people got killed this early since the difficulty of the halls would progressively intensify later on.</p>

  <p>However, despite doing well on the initial stage, Janet knew that it would be impossible to pass through all without any sort of minor injury.</p>

  <p>In her previous venture, only two people of her original party were able to get to the final stage. This meant that all their efforts had been in vain and that they failed in passing the Hall of Causality.</p>

  <p>She clearly remembered the second hall being more challenging back then, three people even died.</p>

  <p>"You mean, we didn't actually figure out the real rules of this hall?" Luo Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"I think so but... Maybe we should go through it first," she said, taking small steps forward.</p>

  <p>The rest of the team began to advance. At the same time, all of the giant stones began to roll out.</p>

  <p>The sound of rolling stones was deafening as it echoed throughout the entire hall.</p>

  <p>Rumble! Rumble!</p>

  <p>Everyone followed the human warrior's advice and moved along the diagonal lines on the grid pattern. This meant that the stones would have to constantly change their directions which made it difficult to keep up with the warriors.</p>

  <p>This second hall was several times wider than the first one but it didn't take them that long to reach the end.</p>

  <p>"We made it!"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! This one's pretty easy although the reward isn't that much. I don't know if I'll be able to get back my five million points."</p>

  <p>"Look! That's..."</p>

  <p>Just as they thought it was all over, a fence made up of rows of white light rose before them!</p>

  <p>The exit was blocked completely, making it impossible for them to continue forward.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is this? Why is it not letting us pass?!" the ogre warrior screamed in frustration.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng also frowned. This white light barrier was a problem and the stones behind them were now quickly rolling towards them.</p>

  <p>"Retreat!" Janet ordered. "I knew it wasn't going to be that easy." She quickly turned into a white shadow and dived downwards just as a stone pressed towards her.</p>

  <p>'The way is blocked. Is it some sort of mechanism? Or do we have to fulfill a certain condition to pass?' Luo Luo Zheng pondered as he dodged the stones.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Help!" someone shouted not too far away.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked and saw a warrior who had gotten himself backed into a corner surrounded by three stones.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng quickly shot forward and sent out a palm strike towards the warrior.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's attack sent him flying out of danger while he quickly found a gap between the stones and escaped.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing?!"</p>

  <p>Janet screamed in panic when she saw what he did.</p>

  <p>Why in the world would he put himself in danger like that?</p>

  <p>She still wanted a chance to challenge him. It would be a shame if he died so early in here.</p>

  <p>If he got crushed then he wouldn't have only wasted his five million Illusion Points. He would also lose half of his remaining points and take a plunge in the rankings.</p>

  <p>It wasn't just Janet, the others were also equally shocked by Luo Zheng's actions. Although they were a team, that was only because they were forced to be. They were far from being a consolidated unit who understood each other completely. Some of them even had enmity with others so it was truly strange for Luo Luo Zheng to risk his neck just to save that warrior.</p>

  <p>His willingness to sacrifice touched them a bit.</p>

  <p>However, they also thought it was really stupid. Nobody would be able to resist the pressure of these stones once they pressed down on you.</p>

  <p>They would immediately get crushed and die if ever that happend.</p>
