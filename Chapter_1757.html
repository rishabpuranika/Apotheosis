<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1757 Summoning For A Gathering </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>In the past few days, whenever the malicious Mu Ning containing the poison exerted itself, Zheng's actions became more violent than before.</p>

  <p>But gradually, he too came to understand the thoughts of Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>To cultivate the Emotion Closing Godly Way meant completely discarding one's emotions. However, there had been times when even the Buddha got angry. It was simply unrealistic for a martial artist, who was nonetheless a living being, to completely discard all feelings.</p>

  <p>The only other way for Luo Zheng was to be like a hard stone. Then, he would truly be ruthless and heartless.</p>

  <p>There was almost no such thing as the absolute Emotion Closing Godly Way. Zheng's talent was supreme, and he had gradually approached the Emotion Closing Godly Way merely by relying on instinct, but there was still some way for him to go.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen had helped Luo Zheng with a special technique to fill in the gap.</p>

  <p>The special malicious Mu Ning had been created by Sword Chen himself. By using the malicious Mu Ning to fill one's body, one could turn themselves into a ruthless killer.</p>

  <p>In this state, Luo Zheng completely withdrew all his emotions, his perception of external things dropping infinitely.</p>

  <p>At this moment, he did not even know if he was human, ghost, or a different entity altogether.</p>

  <p>This was why he had launched an attack on anyone he saw when the malicious Mu Ning exploded. Whether it was Tianming, Lucille, or even Lawson, whom he despised, he targeted all of them and attacked them undiscriminatingly.</p>

  <p>When he was no longer influenced by the fluctuation of his emotions, he would close off his emotions. To put it bluntly, Luo Zheng would become heartless like a stone. He would only know how to kill, uncaring of his reasons for killing, or the consequences of killing his opponents.</p>

  <p>Master Feng should have expected this long back. He had thrown him into this scenario and let him do whatever he wanted. The other warriors were not so easy to mess with anyway, so nothing bad could happen to them.</p>

  <p>However, at this stage, Luo Zheng was not familiar with the malicious Mu Ning enough to sever his emotions correctly. He could abandon his emotions when he was in a frenzied state, but he was unable to control himself.</p>

  <p>As he went berserk time and time again, Zheng's consciousness gradually grew independent.</p>

  <p>At the beginning, he had been like a primal beast. After losing his consciousness, he charged toward Tianming and the others purely on instinct.</p>

  <p>Now when Zheng's eyes had become bloodshot red, he could control his own actions to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng gained control on his emotions, he would step into the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was able to draw and wield his sword multiple times in quick succession, but he was still unable to employ the Gods-intimidating Strike. Tianming and the rest had gotten used to Zheng's madness in the past few days. They seemed to be treating it as a form of practice. Whenever they sensed that Luo Zheng growing abnormal, they would step away and use different means to control him.</p>

  <p>However, today something unexpected happened.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning was someone who only believed in what she saw and never thought of it too deeply. She seemed to be unable to think straight, especially when Luo Zheng was involved.</p>

  <p>A glimpse of the situation made Mu Ning believe that the other warriors were going up against Luo Zheng, who was all alone.</p>

  <p>How could she stand to see it?</p>

  <p>Her body trembled in anger. She endured the side effects of exchanging blood and manipulated four swords as they shot out, her pale pink sleeves fluttering in the air.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Margaret's strength had not been on full display in the Illusion Battlefield, and under this seemingly dire situation, she attacked without much thought of how much strength she employed. The four swords instantly reached Luo Zheng, spinning in a circle around him. They formed a defensive sword array, instantly creating distance between the others and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The sword array was so powerful that even Tianming and the rest of them grew wary of it. They could only retreat.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning came to stand firmly in front of Luo Zheng and shouted, her voice full of wrath, "Don't you dare ambush Luo Zheng! You're courting death!" Her tone was insolent. She had never taken these ace talents or Godly Geniuses too seriously.</p>

  <p>Lucille pursed her lips, revealing traces of mischievousness and ridicule on her cold, gorgeous face.</p>

  <p>Kurt and Karl did not utter a word.</p>

  <p>Tianming knew of Margaret's personality. A look of helplessness flashed in his eyes as he reminded her, "Be careful now! Watch your back…"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning spluttered, somewhat stunned. Slowly, she felt the malicious Mu Ning surging from behind her.</p>

  <p>She turned her head and saw a blue sword heading straight for her face!</p>

  <p>Mu Ning would never have thought that Zheng's sword would come at her.</p>

  <p>In fact, she had already summoned four swords, so with a raise of her hand, she should be successful in blocking the attack that was coming her way.</p>

  <p>After all, in this state, Luo Zheng was not in complete control of himself. His attack was not that powerful.</p>

  <p>However, Margaret's way of thinking was different. Or, it could be said that she was prone to be emotional, especially while facing Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>She did not try to dodge or block the strike, instead, she internally grieved over why Luo Zheng was attacking her.</p>

  <p>'Will he tell me why he's doing this before I die?' she wondered to herself, the disbelief obvious on her face.</p>

  <p>The sword was not slow to come. In an instant, it was only an inch away from Mu Ning. As it charged straight at Mu Ning, about to pierce through her, Luo Zheng suddenly roared as his left hand clenched into a fist. He punched the hand holding the sword.</p>

  <p>The Thunder Wind Divine Sword flew out of his hand under the great strength and the tip of the sword diverted from Margaret's face. But as the sword flew out, the sword edge spiraled back, cutting off a small section of the hair at the back of Margaret's ears. Her hair fluttered in the air. The sword had been so close to hacking her body to pieces!</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>The long sword fell to the ground…</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng gritted his teeth as he panted heavily. He cursed in anger. "Are you a fool?!"</p>

  <p>Mu Ning looked at Luo Zheng blankly, her eyes full of confusion. She felt betrayed. She had almost been killed by Luo Zheng just now, and now he was calling her a fool…</p>

  <p>In the Illusion Battlefield, she had not had many opportunities to be with Luo Zheng. Perhaps, she thought, she was truly unimportant to this man.</p>

  <p>"You… What are you up to?" Margaret's eyes turned red. She and her master had traveled thousands of miles to come here. She had endured the pain of exchanging blood. Now that she had finally met Luo Zheng again, she did not expect him to treat her like this.</p>

  <p>Every time the poisonous malicious Mu Ning erupted, it lasted for some time.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had gradually controlled his body in these past few days, but it was difficult to suppress his urges swiftly.</p>

  <p>After all, Luo Zheng was trying to adapt to the malicious Mu Ning while controlling his own body, so that he could comprehend the Emotion Closing Godly Way. But now, to keep Mu Ning safe, he had to suppress the malicious Mu Ning. This was going in the opposite way he wanted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved his hand and ignored the turmoil in his body. He gritted his teeth. "Can someone please take her away…"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In a flash, Lucille gestured at Mu Ning to leave. She was amazed.</p>

  <p>Lucille had never encountered any woman as stupid as Mu Ning, who had failed to sense that Luo Zheng was troubled by the malicious Mu Ning in his body. Lucille did not even bother explaining it to Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>As emotional as Mu Ning was, she finally realized what was truly going on. Her ears reddened and her face turned pale, making her look rather adorable.</p>

  <p>After a long while, the malicious Mu Ning within Zheng's body calmed down.</p>

  <p>He finally returned to normal. Wearing an angry expression on his face, he strode towards Mu Ning. "Didn't you know that it was dangerous for you to act like that?"</p>

  <p>Just now, he had almost killed Mu Ning with his sword. Luo Zheng himself was shocked.</p>

  <p>A look of grievance appeared on Margaret's face, like she was a child being scolded for having done something wrong. She knew her fault, and she did not dare refute him. "I didn't see what you were doing…"</p>

  <p>Seeing Margaret's pale face, Luo Zheng knew that she had gone through a blood exchange. His eyes softened. She had good intentions. There were too many people in this world who wished only to do good, but often could not help but do harm instead. Some of them even lost what they had in the process.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was about to reprimand her, but he bit back the words on his lips and reached out to touch her hair. "Next time, don't act like this."</p>

  <p>"Okay…" Mu Ning pursed her lips and nodded. A bright smile made its way to her face. She stood on her tiptoes and wrapped her arms around Zheng's waist, inhaling his scent.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew that Margaret's promise was only perfunctory. She never learned her lessons by heart. He heaved a sigh helplessly…</p>

  <p>As Nathan and Lawson saw this scene before them, they both sneered at the same time.</p>

  <p>Currently, except for Shania, all the top ten warriors of the Illusion Battlefield had arrived.</p>

  <p>But there was no news yet from the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Mu Ning wished that no one would come to disturb her. She felt strange about Zheng's way of cultivating Emotion Closing Godly Way. She joined the others on the second day when Luo Zheng went out of control. However, she was more of a troublemaker and soon was asked to stay by the sidelines to watch.</p>

  <p>Zheng's control over his state was getting better and easier. It was only a matter of time until he became a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Celestial Position sent someone over. Master Feng summoned the nine warriors for a gathering.</p>

  <p>In the past few days, the Celestial Position had been making plans, and now it was finally time to see what they were up to.</p>
