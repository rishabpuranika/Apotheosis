  <p>Luo Zheng stood still inside the holy spring, letting his body gently soak in the silver spring water.</p>

  <p>His attention was not on the spring water itself, but on why Chiyou had arranged such a test in the first place.</p>

  <p>If the Yellow Emperor Guards hadn't killed anyone from the Nine Li race all those years ago, would the Nine Li people still have had to kill each other like this in order to become Holy Beings?</p>

  <p>Anyone who had reached the consummation of True God Realm could be considered useful in the Nine Li race. They were the hopes for the future.</p>

  <p>As soon as this thought came to his mind, Luo Zheng patted his head and realized that he had made a big mistake.</p>

  <p>If the Nine Li people were still alive, they would have been a whole. In that case, this many people wouldn't be able to enter the Mountain of Holy Beings, and there wouldn't be such a cruel competition. The holy springs were only a test.</p>

  <p>Splash...</p>

  <p>After that realization, Luo Zheng continued to bathe in the holy spring, but he soon discovered something wrong.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Mountain of Holy Beings, he had been told that all he needed to do was occupy a holy spring, which was not a difficult task for him.</p>

  <p>Then, as he bathed in the holy spring, the spring water was supposed to enter his elixir field and merge with his inner world.</p>

  <p>However, the spring water wasn't entering his body at all. It just gathered around his body and slid down his skin like ordinary spring water. He felt as if he was taking a bath!</p>

  <p>"The spring water isn't entering my body. What's going on?" A strange expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face. "No. 9527, do you know what's going on?" he asked.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 thought for a moment and then said, "The role of the Rebirth Land is to connect your life to it. The holy spring can help you build a Rebirth Land. Since it seems to be incompatible with you, it means that you can't connect your life to a Rebirth Land."</p>

  <p>The explanation was quite easy to understand, but a helpless expression came over Luo Zheng's face. "There must be a reason!" he cried.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, No. 9527 shook its head and said, "Who knows what the reason is? Maybe the holy spring doesn't like you."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was rendered speechless. He pursed his lips with an expression of dismay.</p>

  <p>'My father built the Evolutionary Universe. Why can't I build my own universe?'</p>

  <p>Thinking of this, Luo Zheng sat down cross-legged and gently extended his hand to lead the spring water to his abdomen. He intended to forcefully drive the spring water into his inner world.</p>

  <p>However, as soon as the silver spring water touched his elixir field, it flew back.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if his inner world and the spring water were repelling each other.</p>

  <p>"How could this be?" Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>"Don't be sad. Although the Rebirth Land can give you the opportunity to be reborn, it comes at a price. You know what, I am much more interested in the original will of the Mountain of Holy Beings," said No. 9527.</p>

  <p>Both No. 9527 and the strong warriors at the Other Shore Realm seemed to have nothing but disdain for the Rebirth Land.</p>

  <p>Despite what No. 9527 said, Luo Zheng continued to give it a try.</p>

  <p>But to his disappointment, he was unable to merge with the spring water no matter how much he tried. This meant that he couldn't become a Holy Being at all!</p>

  <p>If he hadn't experienced it himself, he wouldn't have believed that such a strange thing would happen to him.</p>

  <p>His face turned sullen. Seeing Sword Chen still fighting with the silver men, he sighed in his heart. Then, his eyes swept over the others and spotted Leland.</p>

  <p>A dozen people were still fighting for a holy spring, but Leland had already retreated.</p>

  <p>He wasn't strong enough to fight against the others.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng thought for a moment, and then said to Leland through his chaotic energy, "Leland, come to my holy spring."</p>

  <p>In fact, Leland and the others had been stealing glances at Luo Zheng all along with hopeful thoughts swirling inside their heads.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng really couldn't merge with the holy spring, it would mean a chance for them.</p>

  <p>The more time Luo Zheng took, the more the wheels had churned in their heads.</p>

  <p>They had all wondered how they could get Luo Zheng to readily agree to hand the holy spring over to them.</p>

  <p>Leland had also had such thoughts, but he had quickly dispelled them.</p>

  <p>Although he and Luo Zheng were old friends, their friendship was not that deep.</p>

  <p>'Would Luo Zheng give away the holy spring to me? No, I'm afraid it's just wishful thinking, ' Leland thought to himself.</p>

  <p>But just at this moment, Luo Zheng spoke to him through his chaotic energy, making his heart throb and his body tremble. He looked at Luo Zheng in disbelief.</p>

  <p>Even the voice that came from his own life vitality trembled as he asked,</p>

  <p>"You mean you want me to take up this holy spring?"</p>

  <p>"That's right. It seems that I can't build my Rebirth Land. Come, if you will," Luo Zheng said, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Leland didn't know what the Rebirth Land meant. He only knew that Luo Zheng genuinely intended to give the holy spring to him.</p>

  <p>For a while, he was unable to believe what was happening, but then he abruptly turned into a gust of wind and flew toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When the others saw what Leland was doing, their eyes flashed with understanding and they sprang to action.</p>

  <p>They didn't know what Leland had said to Luo Zheng, but they were confident that they could win Luo Zheng over too.</p>

  <p>Some of them were much faster than Leland.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng Luo, I have a third grade supreme treasure of belief at home. If you give me the holy spring, I will present the treasure to you in return. I will not retract my words. Believe me!"</p>

  <p>"I have an amazing token learned from my ancestors!"</p>

  <p>These people were racking their brains to list the best things they had, trying their best to win Luo Zheng's favor.</p>

  <p>When Leland heard these words, he was stunned.</p>

  <p>He had nothing to offer Luo Zheng in exchange for the holy spring, so he stopped midway, afraid that Luo Zheng would change his mind and give the holy spring to someone else.</p>

  <p>After the warriors had all finished speaking, Luo Zheng asked nonchalantly, "What are your treasures compared with the title of a Holy Being?"</p>

  <p>One of them thought for a moment and replied, "They are nothing at all."</p>

  <p>"So I'm not interested," Luo Zheng said in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

  <p>"But my supreme treasure of belief..."</p>

  <p>"My..."</p>

  <p>The group became anxious at once.</p>

  <p>Who would be willing to give up such a good opportunity?</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's annoyance was rising. His face darkened, and a cold aura suddenly shot out from him. "I have given this holy spring to Leland. You all should leave. Otherwise, don't blame me for what happens next!"</p>

  <p>Seeing that Luo Zheng was angry, the crowd went silent. They reluctantly left, casting longing glances at the holy spring.</p>

  <p>Leland, on the other hand, felt very much indebted to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It had never occurred to him that the journey to the Abyss Demon Region could bring him the opportunity to be a Holy Being. In no time, his clan would join the powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Leland rushed toward the holy spring, and Luo Zheng retreated.</p>

  <p>However, Leland still had to face the test of the silver men. The moment he approached the holy spring, six silver men appeared in the pool just like before.</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng withdrew from the holy spring, he did not go to look for the maze.</p>

  <p>After leaving the Abyss Demon Region, Sword Chen had been unable to use the force of primitive fear. With his current strength, he might not be able to go up against a group of Demi-holy Beings if they decided to besiege him. So, Luo Zheng intended to stay here until Sword Chen finished bathing in the holy spring.</p>
