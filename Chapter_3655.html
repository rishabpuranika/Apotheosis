<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Elizabeth changed Tyrese's blood under Athemar's suspicious gaze.</p>

  <p>Pearce landed quietly beside Athemar and patted him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>There was no need for words. Athemar could figure out what Pearce meant with that simple gesture.</p>

  <p>With Elizabeth's help along with the Corpse Spirit Sun Crows, Zheng was able to change the blood of all warriors of the Sun Crow race that attacked the Oneness Array.</p>

  <p>One of the members sensed something was wrong halfway and tried to escape. Unfortunately for him, Micah and Bagot forcefully recaptured him under Zheng's orders.</p>

  <p>The more members of the Sun Crow race in Zheng's team, the easier it would be for him to deal with his other remaining enemies.</p>

  <p>After dealing with the Sun Crow race in the Oneness Array, Zheng turned his attention to the Azure Array.</p>

  <p>The seven great arrays were originally separated by several hundred miles.</p>

  <p>After the Sky Net was folded, the arrays drew closer to each other. The distance between the Azure Array and the Oneness Array was now only about two hundred miles which could be crossed in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Azure Mountain was the best at defense among the seven mountains and the Azure Array was called the Shield and Sword Array as a result.</p>

  <p>After launching their attacks, the Sun Crow race still failed in destroying the array and ended up getting driven out by the people of the Azure Mountain.</p>

  <p>The Azure Mountain's head joined his warriors to defend their array and keep it guarded at all times.</p>

  <p>Defense, however, was intrinsically passive. There was still the possibility of the array being destroyed if all the Azure Mountain people did was stay there on guard ‒ which was exactly what happened.</p>

  <p>The Shield and Sword Array was now on the verge of collapse under the relentless attacks of the Sun Crow race. All the strategic positions on the left side had been conquered leading to low morale among the Azure Mountain warriors.</p>

  <p>"Hold on, brothers! The Oneness Array is quite close. Once they defeat their enemies, they'll surely come to our rescue!" the Azure Mountain's head assured his warriors in a loud, determined voice even if his own resolve was already shaking.</p>

  <p>His assurance did the trick in lifting his brethren's spirit. The beaten warriors looked a bit better with their faces now filled with anticipation.</p>

  <p>Things might not necessarily go their way but a sliver of hope remained.</p>

  <p>The Sun Crow race had an edge in this war since they had more powerful warriors in their ranks. Though the Oneness Array was marshalled by the likes of Pearce and Auden, there were far more powerful people within the Sun Crow race that could face against them. For all they knew, the people of the Oneness Mountain might be too busy protecting themselves, but the Azure Mountain had to remain hopeful.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, black dots appeared in the distance and the Azure Mountain's head looked on in despair.</p>

  <p>"More Sun Crows are coming!"</p>

  <p>"They came from the direction of the Oneness Array!"</p>

  <p>"Did the Oneness Mountain fall?"</p>

  <p>Any sort of hope they had was now squashed by the appearance of these Sun Crows. They wished for reinforcement but they were given more enemies to seal their doom. Such was the cruelty of reality.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, Micah and Bagot!" a Sun Crow called Calvert greeted these new arrivals. "You came here faster than I would've thought. These Azure Mountain brats are a bunch of cowards, always standing guard in their array." These incoming allies were welcomed warmly by the Sun Crow race. Calvert, like Micah and Bago, was a first-rank warrior and led the attack against the Azure Array.</p>

  <p>Micah nodded with a fake smile plastered on his face as he landed beside Calvert along with Bagot, Elizabeth, and Dugan.</p>

  <p>"The humans guarding the Oneness Array are the strongest amongst the seven mountains," Calvert remarked. "How were you able to defeat them in such a short period of time?"</p>

  <p>Micah only sighed. "It's a long story."</p>

  <p>Calvert nodded with a smile. "A story to share for another time. Let us conquer the Azure Array first!"</p>

  <p>Victory was definitely within their grasp!</p>

  <p>The people of the Azure Mountain could only look on hopelessly at the imminent attack of their now larger enemies.</p>

  <p>Once all seven mountains were defeated, the destruction of the entire Oneness Sky Palace would be inevitable.</p>

  <p>Emperor Charm did not even need to show up.</p>

  <p>Their defeat was now moments away.</p>

  <p>Micah nodded at Calvert. "Okay then. Let's do it."</p>

  <p>With Calvert's directive, the Sun Crows he led began to launch their attack.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to them, Micah's group was not there to aid but to attack them!</p>

  <p>As Micah gave the signal, Zheng controlled all the Sun Crows and made them stab their own allies.</p>

  <p>Calvert's group was weaker compared to Micah's and the suddenness of their betrayal caught them off guard.</p>

  <p>The sight of Sun Crows stabbing their own shocked the Azure Mountain's head immensely. He had to pinch himself just to make sure it wasn't a dream.</p>

  <p>"What... What are they doing?!"</p>

  <p>"They're killing each other!" "How is this possible?!"</p>

  <p>"What in the world is happening?!"</p>

  <p>After Micah subdued Calvert's group, Zheng along with Pearce and Auden slowly descended from the sky.</p>

  <p>All throughout, they hadn't given Calvert and his men any chance to resist.</p>

  <p>Before they could even think of escaping, they had already been injected with the transformed blood.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded in satisfaction. "Well done."</p>

  <p>He now had over twenty warriors of the Sun Crow race on his side. His force was nothing to be scoffed at since it was comprised of these powerful warriors.</p>

  <p>Any decrease in the Sun Crow race's army was a victory as far as he was concerned.</p>

  <p>"Elder Pearce! Elder Auden! What happened?" The earlier events felt like a dream and the Azure Mountain's head was still in a bit of a daze.</p>

  <p>He couldn't be blamed for still remaining on guard at their strange but much-appreciated allies. Their situation was just completely reversed in a snap.</p>

  <p>He was actually scared that it was all just an illusion.</p>

  <p>There was no need for Zheng to explain things all over again. Pearce simply sent a message to the Azure Mountain's head via life vitality to give him a brief outline of the situation.</p>

  <p>After all the information had been given, the Azure Mountain's head could only stare at Zheng with wide-eyed shock.</p>

  <p>This man had long been a famous disciple in the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>Zheng had stood out in Stage Four of the Other Shore, causing quite a stir.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Bearing race couldn't deal with him and had no choice but to negotiate with the Oneness Sky Palace.</p>

  <p>All of the mountain heads agreed that he was someone who had a promising future.</p>

  <p>It normally took hundreds or thousands of years for a young genius to become a real master.</p>

  <p>However, it had only been a couple of years and Zheng was now the mastermind behind this reversal of fortune in the great war between two super forces.</p>

  <p>The Azure Mountain's head could only sigh in disbelief. It didn't matter to him just what sort of method Zheng used in making the Sun Crows surrender to him, what mattered was that this war was now in their hands.</p>

  <p>When the array opened to let them in, a new group of people appeared in the distance.</p>

  <p>Rays of purple light emerged from their path as they arrived.</p>

  <p>Pearce's face darkened angrily as he saw the arrival of this purple glow.</p>

  <p>"Gethin is coming!"</p>

  <p>Even the Azure Mountain's head looked infuriated. "He must think that our Azure Mountain is the weakest among all the mountains so he chose to attack us first."</p>

  <p>Gethin's betrayal of the other six mountains at such a critical moment greatly disappointed the other leaders.</p>

  <p>There was no way back for the Vastness Mountain now. This betrayal would forever stay with Gethin and he would have to eliminate the other six mountains to avoid any possible revenge.</p>

  <p>When the Sun Crow race launched their violent attacks among the six mountains, Gethin took his time and got his own people ready.</p>

  <p>Just as the Azure Mountain's head predicted, they were his first target.</p>
