<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Martial Arts Contest held by World Commercial Alliance, only sects on and above the fourth tier were eligible to enter the main draw match directly. The disciples didn't even need to appear for the pre-qualifying test to participate.</p>

  <p>The Mysterious Luna Hall was one of the oldest sects in the Central Region. Its cultivation methods were sinister and ruthless. It simply didn't adhere to the principles of the righteous or those of devilry. It could conform to any as and when needed. This was why they weren't particularly respected in the Region.</p>

  <p>Even so, nobody was careless enough to slight such a mysterious fourth-tier sect as that. Elderly Luna, who was more than 900 years old, had become a legend in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>A lot of high platforms had already been erected on another side of the field. After a while, the gigantic-looking coffin slowly landed on one of the platforms.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The top uncovered on its own as soon as it landed. An old man wearing a black cloak crawled out of it. The deep wrinkles on his face made him look ancient. It almost felt like he was so perishable that he could fall asleep any time now, never to wake up. Despite the creases and folds on his face, his hair was pitch black, giving him a rather spooky appearance.</p>

  <p>This was whom the legends were about: Elderly Luna, the head of Mysterious Luna Hall.</p>

  <p>All the martial arts practitioners who owned a supreme life vitality crystal were very influential in the martial arts community. As a result, they knew all the other powerful practitioners in the Central Region.</p>

  <p>The crowd recognized the old man at a single glance. Exclamations and heated discussions started to fly among hundreds of thousands of martial arts practitioners.</p>

  <p>"That's Elderly Luna. He is around a thousand years old!</p>

  <p>And he's still alive!"</p>

  <p>"He's not a thousand years old yet. According to the records, he's 976 years old. He still has more than 20 years to go before he turns 1000!" "Do you think he can survive all these years?"</p>

  <p>"Shh! Keep your voices down. If these words reach any of Mysterious Luna Hall's people, you'd be dead in no time."</p>

  <p>Along with Elderly Luna, tens of elders and disciples of Mysterious Luna Hall also appeared for the contest. There had to be only 4 spots for the Mysterious Luna Hall. No one knew who out of all of them would be selected to participate in the contest.</p>

  <p>"Bloodwood Cliff," the elder of World Commercial Alliance heralded again.</p>

  <p>A carriage flew over and stopped on another platform. A milky fair foot stretched out of the carriage first. Then, a woman wearing a satin red gown emerged from it. This was Lady Poison-blood.</p>

  <p>Her skin struck out of the red fabric, almost glowing, giving her a rather bewitching presence. It took just one look for all the men around to get excited at her arrival.</p>

  <p>"It's Lady Poison-blood. Isn't she completely gorgeous!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but so what? She's too old. Who knows how many men she has slept with?"</p>

  <p>"Hey! Martial arts practitioners are not supposed to judge people by their ages. Even if she's 200, she looks like she's only 20! Moreover, she appears as delicate as a 16-year-old!"</p>

  <p>Lady Poison-blood's arrival filled the practitioners with lust. The fact that there were so many of them made them unafraid of offending her. In half a heartbeat, all kinds of obscene words started to circulate in the air.</p>

  <p>But Lady Poison-blood herself was known to have slutty tendencies and didn't take offense at their words. A few disciples of Bloodwood Cliff walked out of the carriage too and stood beside her.</p>

  <p>"Cloud Hall," the elder announced the next name.</p>

  <p>A flood dragon soared roaring in the sky, tumbled above the clouds and then descended from the sky.</p>

  <p>"Flood dragon! Run!" someone screamed in panic.</p>

  <p>"Don't panic! What of a flood dragon? Don't forget where we are. This is the Martial Arts Contest. Tons of accomplished practitioners of Virtual Tribulation Realm are here. If anything happens, these people would be held directly accountable for it. Surely, they might have calculated all the risks."</p>

  <p>"But why is this flood dragon even here? It could easily die here!"</p>

  <p>Most practitioners didn't know Cloud Hall had simply gotten a puppet flood dragon, to threaten everyone and establish their power.</p>

  <p>As soon as the dragon coiled on the designated platform, Ning Yudie was seen walking from behind it.</p>

  <p>She wore a sparkling white dress, with two long decorative phoenix feathers swinging about her as she walked with confidence. She looked like a fairy, aloof and elegant.</p>

  <p>Apart from being beautiful, she was also the head of Cloud Hall, which was why she was the dream girl of many practitioners.</p>

  <p>She was so graceful even the most boorish practitioners didn't have the heart to talk about her vulgarly, exactly in contradiction to how they treated Lady Poison-blood. Even those who had the lowest ranks changed their tones according to who they were talking about.</p>

  <p>"People say the head of Cloud Hall is stunning as a fairy. Boy, they are right! She's breathtaking."</p>

  <p>"She's not like a fairy. She is a fairy."</p>

  <p>"If I could talk to such a beauty just once, I wouldn't have anything else to wish for."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie looked at the arena indifferently. Her eyes swept across the crowd of practitioners who had passed the pre-qualifying test. Finally, her eyes found Luo Zheng, only to discover he was looking at her too. Swiftly, she looked elsewhere, pretending she hadn't noticed him at all.</p>

  <p>But the pretense was too obvious. It wasn't very hard for Luo Zheng to detect it. He shook his head with a faint smile, wondering why Ning Yudie was putting up such an act.</p>

  <p>Following Ning Yudie, several elders walked out of the coiled flood dragon, then five disciples as well. Two of them were early-stage Internal Elixir Realm practitioners and the other three were middle-stage practitioners.</p>

  <p>They were the strongest among all the disciples of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>As they took ground next to their elders, another announcement occurred.</p>

  <p>"Black Mountain Sect."</p>

  <p>A big flock of crows came flying towards the arena. As soon as they alighted on the platform, they flew back to where they'd come from. Raven wearing a mask was seen on the platform, along with all the elders and disciples of the Black Mountain Sect.</p>

  <p>"Ethereal Spirit Sect!" Another announcement.</p>

  <p>This time a ship descended on one of the platforms. Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit flew off the ship.</p>

  <p>Among them was also a Taoist priest in a cyan gown, with a flying sword strapped across his back.</p>

  <p>This elegant and handsome Taoist priest was none other than Xander, the leader of Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Ethereal Spirit Sect was the only fifth-tier sect in Central Region, which accounted for its sensational arrival. Each and every eye was drawn toward the spectacle.</p>

  <p>Joining this sect was the ultimate goal of every single martial arts practitioner in Central Region.</p>

  <p>"Xander didn't use to attend the Martial Arts Contest in the past years. Only the Septuplets of Ethereal Spirit would attend the event on his behalf every time. How surprising that he showed up this year!"</p>

  <p>"This year's Martial Arts Contest is like no other. So many sects are interested in the Dragon Soar Arena. It's only normal for Xander to come here in such circumstances."</p>

  <p>"One can imagine how fierce this year's Martial Arts Contest is going to be.</p>

  <p>I'm afraid too many contestants might die."</p>

  <p>While the mob discussed the seriousness of the contest, the elder of World Commercial Alliance announced again, "The Venerable Starry!"</p>

  <p>The Venerable Starry was an independent warrior, with absolutely excellent disciples.</p>

  <p>"The Star clan in Central Region."</p>

  <p>Besides some fourth-tier sects in Central Region, there were also some fourth-tier clans. The Star clan was one of them. Actually, it was a union of six third-tier clans. They had decided to unite in order to become stronger, more famous and important in the Region. This assorted clan had many times proved to be as powerful as a fourth-tier sect.</p>

  <p>"Confucianism Sage Winston."</p>

  <p>"Evil East Lord Eddie."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyebrows rose at the name that the elder had just announced. He looked toward the sky, his eyes glistening with excitement.</p>

  <p>'Eddie...' he thought.</p>

  <p>'I've been waiting for you for so long. Finally, you've arrived!'</p>

  <p>Zheng's goal wasn't only to win the Martial Arts Contest and get Dragon Soar Arena, but also to kill Marilyn.</p>

  <p>She was someone who was very close to Eddie. She also had the Purple Power Body.</p>

  <p>At the moment, it wasn't practical for Luo Zheng to believe he could defeat Eddie and save Yan by competing against him one-on-one.</p>

  <p>However, if he killed Marilyn, Eddie would have to find another woman who had the Purple Power Body, which would be very difficult for him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could use that time to get stronger.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, Luo Zheng saw a robust figure flying toward him, with a few others in its tow.</p>

  <p>At one glance, he recognized the person. He was middle-aged and had a gigantic face. This was the same face he had seen at Cloud Sect.</p>

  <p>That was Eddie, the strongest practitioner in Central Region. He was Zheng's archenemy.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Luo Zheng stared at him intently, as if trying to imprint the image of his face on his mind.</p>

  <p>When his eyes shifted from him and he saw who was flying right behind Eddie, he was utterly surprised!</p>

  <p>'Is that Marilyn?' he wondered.</p>

  <p>This woman was fat as butter. Fat hung under her chin, hiding her neck. The weirdest thing was, Luo Zheng couldn't tell her cultivation base.</p>

  <p>'What's going on?</p>

  <p>Isn't she supposed to be at the middle-stage of Internal Elixir Realm? Why can't I tell her cultivation base?'</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng possessed outstanding abilities of perceiving, which usually told him how strong a person was within seconds upon meeting him briefly. Only those who were much stronger than him could make his perception fail. But Marilyn wasn't that stronger.</p>

  <p>While he wondered about her cultivation base, he noticed another woman behind her, who seemed more like Marilyn. This woman was young and beautiful and wore a small black outfit. She too was a middle-stage practitioner of Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>'She ought to be Marilyn.'</p>

  <p>He was just trying to guess. He wasn't sure, but he thought there was a high chance he was right.</p>

  <p>There were three other people in the group. One of them was a smartly dressed young boy. His handsome face had a touch of tenderness. By the looks of him, it seemed like he was Eddie's son. Only, Luo Zheng wasn't sure if he was a participant in the Martial Arts Contest. If he was, he'd be Zheng's rival.</p>

  <p>Behind this boy were two teenage girls.</p>

  <p>Zheng's pupils dilated the moment his eyes landed on one of them. He blinked in disbelief.</p>

  <p>One of those girls was Yan.</p>

  <p>She looked very different than before. Her eyes were closed as she followed them, seeming to float in space like a piece of wood.</p>

  <p>"Yan, what happened to you?" Detecting how she had changed angered Luo Zheng.</p>
