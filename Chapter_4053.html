<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others were covered by the Magic Camouflage Skin. This perfectly prevented them from being discovered by the Glede Demon race.</p>

  <p>Senses couldn't be used on the Night View Island, so as long as they held their breath, no one could notice them.</p>

  <p>Even if someone walked past them, they wouldn't find anything.</p>

  <p>"He found us. We're so screwed!"</p>

  <p>Decker's face quickly turned pale as his entire body trembled.</p>

  <p>"Calm down!" Pearson tried to pacify Decker.</p>

  <p>Zheng and the others looked down from the mountain silently and remained motionless as they waited for situation to develop.</p>

  <p>A few moments later, another group of creatures emerged from the other side of the mountain.</p>

  <p>They had red skin and were covered with bright red fur. They carried big sticks on their hands and their ape-like faces looked ferocious.</p>

  <p>"They're from the Red Demon race!"</p>

  <p>"Then, it means Bacchus hasn't found us yet."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank goodness! I thought it was going to be our end…"</p>

  <p>Decker breathed a sigh of relief as if he had barely escaped the jaws of death.</p>

  <p>Even the others were obviously relieved.</p>

  <p>They were also nervous but not panicking in an exaggerated way like Decker. At their current distance from the Glede Demon race and the Red Demon race, the possibility of blowing their disguise was very low.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Bacchus, you've become dull!</p>

  <p>As far as I remember, it was one thousand and five hundred feet the last time. Now, I am able to enter the range of one thousand feet. Beware! Next time, if I make it within a range of five hundred feet, you're dead!" The red-haired creature taking the lead laughed wildly.</p>

  <p>It was Tate, the leader of the Red Demon race.</p>

  <p>For the past generations, these two big races of the Night View Island had been in a constant dispute.</p>

  <p>Whenever there was an opportunity, the Red Demon race and the Glede Demon race would clash with each other.</p>

  <p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>

  <p>"Scrap that!" Tate hit his head with a big stick. "I've changed my mind.</p>

  <p>There's not going to be a next time. Hand over all the Arcana, or you'll die!"</p>

  <p>Bacchus was still standing at the top of the tree, holding the cloth bag in his hand which was filled with Arcana. His brows rose slightly as he listened to Tate's threats.</p>

  <p>Without a doubt, the Red Demon race was extremely powerful.</p>

  <p>In the entire Night View Island, they were considered as one of the three most powerful races.</p>

  <p>However, the Glede Demon race was known to be stronger than them.</p>

  <p>Among the thousand races that inhabited the Night View Island, only three of them were ranked in the first tier. These were the Red Demon race, the Glede Demon race, and the Grand Mighty race.</p>

  <p>All of the other races bowed down and feared these three superior races.</p>

  <p>In fact, the other races even brought offerings to them just to be on their good side.</p>

  <p>However, they still needed to observe their limitations.</p>

  <p>If they went too far, the other races might start forming an alliance. If that happened, they might not actually lose, but several lives would be needlessly wasted.</p>

  <p>Moreover, it had become a taboo in the Night View Island to sacrifice the lives of several races at a time.</p>

  <p>The Glede Demon race actually had done that, but it was not entirely their fault.</p>

  <p>This happened when the Red Demon race crossed the territorial boundary of the Glede Demon race on several occasions for some time now. Then, they forced the leaders of other races to hand over their Arcana.</p>

  <p>Although there wasn't a definite rule about it, the blurry boundaries of the three superior races had always existed.</p>

  <p>The races that were under the Glede Demon race offered the Arcana to them out of their own volition. However, the Red Demon race dared to intrude into their territory to take away their Arcana.</p>

  <p>As a race that was full of pride, they just couldn't let the barbaric Red Demon race continue to do whatever they wished, especially if they were the ones being inconvenienced.</p>

  <p>Bacchus was known as a cruel and wise leader.</p>

  <p>As a means to retaliate, he led his clansmen to the territory of the Red Demon race and sneakily captured some of the creatures there.</p>

  <p>After that, he spread a malicious rumor.</p>

  <p>It said that in order to get the treasures in the Ghost Mountain, the Red Demon race needed a lot of Arcana. To achieve their goal, they were sacrificing a large number of creatures in their territory for that purpose.</p>

  <p>When the rumor started spreading, several creatures from different tribes had already been disappearing in the territory of the Red Demon race, and it continued for a few consecutive days.</p>

  <p>This news spread throughout the entire Night View Island like wildfire. The natives were convinced that the rumor was true because of the sudden disappearance of several races.</p>

  <p>Thus, it aroused extreme fear among the weaker races. They started forming alliances and made their moves in secret.</p>

  <p>They had one goal— to hold the Red Demon race accountable.</p>

  <p>Of course, the Red Demon race needed to do something to stop that.</p>

  <p>With this, Tate led his team and searched for the culprit as fast as they could. At last, they found a clue that led to the Glede Demon race. Now, the Red Demon race wanted to make them pay.</p>

  <p>Hearing Tate's threats, Bacchus wasn't even fazed.</p>

  <p>The Glede Demon race had never been afraid of the Red Demon race. For several years, they always had the upper hand whenever the two of them met on the battlefield. Moreover, their incredible speed was their most coveted attribute. If they discerned that they were at a disadvantage, they could just escape easily. There was no way to bring all of them down.</p>

  <p>While the Red Demon race had supreme defenses and infinite strength, the Glede Demon race also had the exceptional strength to match theirs. Plus, with their unimaginable speed, the Red Demon race could never catch up with them.</p>

  <p>Bacchus showed a huge mocking smile as he stared down at Tate.</p>

  <p>"Did you just say that you would kill me? When did you become so confident?" Bacchus asked in an indifferent tone.</p>

  <p>"Ha! I'll tell you why. Take this!"</p>

  <p>Tate stretched out his hand and a small cage emerged on his palm.</p>

  <p>It looked like a delicate birdcage, but it was too small to be one.</p>

  <p>It was just the size of a palm, and thus no bird could actually be locked inside it.</p>

  <p>Bacchus narrowed his eyes as he stared at Tate and the birdcage that he released. His alertness heightened as he didn't know what Tate could do next.</p>

  <p>There was a huge grin on Tate's face as he tossed the birdcage in the air. In the blink of an eye, it expanded at an amazing speed.</p>

  <p>"What the…"</p>

  <p>Bacchus had never seen an Other Shore Token like this before.</p>

  <p>As it instantly expanded in front of his eyes, he instinctively realized that it must be an item to trap them.</p>

  <p>"Stay away from it!"</p>

  <p>Bacchus immediately spread out his wings, turned into a silver light, and quickly flew away.</p>

  <p>He knew that flying at high speed would shake off the Ghost Powder on his body. Without it, the white-haired monsters would surely come out and get him.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't care much about them at this moment.</p>

  <p>In his mind, he could just apply the Ghost Powder again when the white-haired monsters already appeared. Moreover, the Red Demon race also wouldn't dare to make a move once the white-haired monsters made an appearance.</p>

  <p>However, the speed at which the birdcage expanded was far beyond Bacchus's expectations. It beat his top speed, and as he soared into the sky, the birdcage had already entrapped the entire mountain.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>Unable to immediately stop his movements, Bacchus crashed into the birdcage.</p>

  <p>The birdcage was actually formed by a thin type of net.</p>

  <p>But the net was made of a unique kind of space, giving it an indestructible form.</p>

  <p>It was so sturdy that it was almost impossible to destroy.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The other Glede Demons also crashed into the birdcage. They just bounced back and saw that there wasn't even a scratch on its surface.</p>

  <p>Bacchus was obviously infuriated. With a cold expression in his eyes, he spread out his wings again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He rushed towards the birdcage and slashed it with his blade-like feathers.</p>

  <p>However, it still didn't work.</p>

  <p>There was still no dent or whatsoever on its surface.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>"I'm just getting started," Bacchus said as he wore a serious expression on his face.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, milky white lights appeared on Bacchus's head and wings.</p>

  <p>Then, a pair of bigger white wings appeared and enveloped his original wings.</p>

  <p>He had merged with a powerful Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>With this, he possessed stronger power and theurgies.</p>

  <p>Once Bacchus started focusing on a certain thing, he wouldn't stop until he succeeded.</p>

  <p>This time, his only goal was to break the giant birdcage.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>He rushed and attacked the birdcage again using his white blade-like wings.</p>

  <p>"Take this!</p>

  <p>Vertical slash!"</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>The strikes made on the birdcage produced an explosive sound. The birdcage shook and so did the mountain entrapped by it.</p>

  <p>However, even after Bacchus's vicious attacks, the birdcage was still intact.</p>

  <p>He had to admit that the treasure was truly fascinating.</p>

  <p>Bacchus chose not to waste his energy and turned to Tate.</p>

  <p>"Is this even something from the Night View Island?" Bacchus asked, pointing to the unbreakable birdcage.</p>

  <p>Sensing Bacchus's frustration, Tate grinned complacently. "You don't need to know about that. But I'll let you in on a secret… All of the Glede Demons, including you, will die today!"</p>

  <p>"Really? Please. Don't make me laugh." Bacchus let out a deep sigh and instantly calmed down. His arrogant eyes returned and stared down at Tate.</p>

  <p>"Just because you've trapped us inside this birdcage, you think that you've already won? Why are you so stupid?"</p>

  <p>Everyone knew that in a head-on battle, there was no way that the Glede Demon race would be inferior to the Red Demon race.</p>

  <p>Bacchus just tried to escape because he didn't want a needless duel with the Red Demons at this moment.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, the other superior race, the Grand Mighty race, would just benefit from their losses.</p>

  <p>However, being trapped in the birdcage, Bacchus had no other choice but to remind the Red Demons whom they were facing.</p>
