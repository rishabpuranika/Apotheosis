<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Xun stared blankly at Luo Luo Zheng. She looked like a doll without emotions.</p>

  <p>In a moment of great grief, her mind stopped working.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng looked at her with pity. Seeing that Xun was unable to move, with a simple thought he controlled her light sword spirit and pulled her into his embrace.</p>

  <p>With her hands hanging down, Xun still did not move.</p>

  <p>'You didn't kill them.</p>

  <p>This is exactly what Yao wanted. Either the four of them would die, or you would die. This is not your fault.</p>

  <p>I will help you kill Yao. I will help you! I promise!'</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng thought.</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" Xun said.</p>

  <p>"What?" Luo Luo Zheng was stunned.</p>

  <p>A trace of gleam flashed Xun's dazed eyes. Her mind was connected to Luo Zheng's, so she could feel his determination and decisiveness as his thoughts ran over his mind.</p>

  <p>"I won't compromise. I promise you I'll kill her!" Xun said softly.</p>

  <p>She was sad because of the death of Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth who had once been faithful to her. She had started her path as a remnant and she had put a lot of energy into becoming so strong. She would not change her mind so easily after she made a decision.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng saw that Xun had recovered a little, the corner of his mouth curled up slightly. However, he continued to ask, "Who is that?</p>

  <p>Who do you talk about?"</p>

  <p>"Yao! I will kill her with my own bare hands!" Xun's voice grew louder and louder and a hint of lust for blood appeared in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng continued to encourage her, "Say it louder!"</p>

  <p>"I will kill you, Yao!" Xun kept on screaming out loud. Her voice, which was usually very melodious, turned into a high-pitched scream, just like the angry roar of a young girl.</p>

  <p>The fury in her eyes became intense as did her killing intent.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, pointed his finger at the sky full of stars, saying,</p>

  <p>"They can't hear you. You have to speak louder!"</p>

  <p>Xun wanted to keep on shouting but Luo Luo Zheng extended a finger and pressed it on her lips. With a slight smile, he took out the Roaring Token, which had already been already activated. "Now they can hear you."</p>

  <p>Xun tensed up as her chest contracted. She then roared with the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>As such, the entire universe was filled with a high-pitched scream. It was a declaration that resounded throughout the entire universe.</p>

  <p>"Yao! I will kill you! You will pay for this!"</p>

  <p>An intense scream suddenly burst out, making all the living creatures in the universe get startled. Some fierce beasts who had yet to develop their intelligence grew so restless that they started attacking without reason.</p>

  <p>After a while, Yao's voice was heard once again. "Ha-ha! You want to kill me? Xun, do you think that you are safe? I just sent your four supporters to kill you! But they willingly sacrificed their lives for you. I couldn't predict they would give their lives for yours. Salvador, Aneisha, Viveca and Elspeth were truly faithful... But do you really think you can escape?"</p>

  <p>Xun remained calm. She was prepared to reply with the Roaring Token again but Luo Luo Zheng snatched it from her hands.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember me, bitch?" Luo Luo Zheng said through the Roaring Token with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You? Humph! Of course I remember you. You are just a nobody staying at Xun's side," Yao replied.</p>

  <p>"You tried to kill me several times in the Lower World. Now, do you still want to kill me?" Luo Luo Zheng continued to ask.</p>

  <p>"Humph, you are just as insignificant as an ant. You had a chance to fly into the Upper World only because you encountered Xun's remnant soul. As Xun would die soon, you will die with her," Yao said indifferently.</p>

  <p>In fact, Luo Luo Zheng had made fast and great progress in his cultivation, which worried Yao. She had never seen Luo Luo Zheng, but just as Xun said, Luo Luo Zheng had the fate to lead the world of chaos, and if he obtained a qualification in the Illusion Battlefield, then he would become the most powerful warrior of this age, which would pose a threat to her.</p>

  <p>"What if I won't die?" Luo Luo Zheng suddenly asked.</p>

  <p>Before Yao could reply, Luo Luo Zheng activated his Roaring Token again and said, "Then, will you admit that you're a bitch?"</p>

  <p>"You!" She had been a bit flustered and exasperated with Luo Zheng's disrespectful address to her. She was a queen after all. However, being a queen, she couldn't be bothered with the slandering of a nobody. She hadn't expected Luo Luo Zheng to shout at her again though.</p>

  <p>The voice spreading from the ordinary Roaring Token would sometimes be drowned out by other voices. But Luo Zheng's Roaring Token was very powerful and the voice which came from it would not be drowned.</p>

  <p>Before Yao had a chance to speak, Luo Luo Zheng continued, "After everything you have done, you have reached the lowest level possible. It doesn't matter if you are the queen of the Demon Night. You are a despicable queen!"</p>

  <p>"Ha!" Xun who was at the side suddenly laughed out loud.</p>

  <p>Freya who was in the Reincarnation Plate also couldn't help but laugh.</p>

  <p>She already knew that Luo Luo Zheng was using the Roaring Token, and at the same time, she was sure that the fellow who had used the Roaring Token countless times in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place's mines was him.</p>

  <p>That was the first time Luo Luo Zheng had used the Roaring Token at that time.</p>

  <p>Freya still vividly remembered the words he had uttered through the Roaring Token at that time when he was looking for a girl called Yan, but she didn't know if he had found her or not.</p>

  <p>Freya, Xun and many warriors from many races in the universe were amused hearing Luo Luo Zheng talk to Yao in such a way.</p>

  <p>Yao was the queen of the Demon Night, but she was cursed by Luo Luo Zheng without fear. They thought that Yao had disgraced the Demon Night's name.</p>

  <p>Even the warriors of the Demon Night couldn't help but laugh.</p>

  <p>Yao was undoubtedly the most respected queen of the Demon Night, as well as their faith totem. But there were factions within the Demon Night and each of the three queens had their own supporters. Now the Queen of Punishment, was disliked by a considerable number of Demon Night members, especially by the elders from the Board of Elders.</p>

  <p>Since its foundation, the Demon Night had been ruled by three queens.</p>

  <p>The Queen of Life had always been silent and didn't meddle in anything, even when Yao planned to kill Xun. If Yao succeeded in killing Xun, she would take control of the whole race. The elders of the Board of Elders were already worried about this, but they did not dare say anything out of fear. They were waiting for the opportunity to revolt against Yao.</p>

  <p>Now that they heard the human warrior humiliating Yao, they thought this might be their chance. It felt like Luo Luo Zheng was speaking for them and venting all their grudges that had been harbored for many years.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! This little fellow really has the guts!"</p>

  <p>"But Yao has already targeted and attacked Xun. This guy will probably die sooner or later. How could he be so daring?"</p>

  <p>"Don't underestimate anyone. A bold person might not be reckless.</p>

  <p>Perhaps he really does have something powerful to rely on."</p>

  <p>"I think that this guy's voice sounds exactly the same as that of the mysterious young man who had a quarrel with Supreme Lord Amritpal and Supreme Lord Myles more than a year ago. If that's the case, then his Roaring Tokens..."</p>

  <p>Those powerful warriors would surely notice and think of this matter just as Freya did.</p>

  <p>More than a year ago, a mysterious young man appeared with many Roaring Tokens that he used to curse Amritpal. Then, he used the Roaring Tokens to chat with a mysterious woman.</p>

  <p>No one had figured out who that mysterious woman was. During this one year, she and that mysterious young man seemed to have disappeared.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, Xun's voice suddenly resounded throughout the universe. Not long after that, the voice of the mysterious young man could be heard once more.</p>

  <p>Anyone could see that the mysterious man was Luo Luo Zheng who spoke now and Xun's Roaring Tokens should have come from him.</p>

  <p>"Hey, young man, you have so many Roaring Tokens. Where did you get them?" As expected, at this time, a Supreme Lord roared out a question to Luo Luo Zheng with a Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not afraid at all. He had already provoked Yao and wasn't afraid of provoking a Supreme Lord. "It's none of your business!"</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lord became infuriated at Luo Zheng's answer. "Brat, do you know who you're talking to?"</p>

  <p>"You are a Supreme Lord, right? So what?" Luo Luo Zheng replied.</p>

  <p>"Since you know who I am, are you not afraid of being killed? You know I can find you through the Demon Night, right?" the Supreme Lord said with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Hearing these words, Luo Luo Zheng once again activated the Roaring Token and laughed arrogantly. "I can block the Queen of Punishment's chase. So even if there is one more Supreme Lord attacking me, I can still easily deal with this situation. Why do you think I would be afraid of your threats?"</p>

  <p>His words were extremely arrogant. Xun reached out her hand to cover the Roaring Token while she smiled and shook her head. "Alright, I'm fine now. You can put it away now."</p>

  <p>She knew that Luo Luo Zheng had put in a lot of effort just for her sake.</p>
