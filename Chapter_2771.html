  <p>
</p>

  <p>"I can't defeat you?"</p>

  <p>Zheng frowned at the phantom.</p>

  <p>Even though No. 9527 had said that there was something strange about the phantom in front of him, Zheng didn't believe that it was really him.</p>

  <p>The chillness of the air around him calmed him down quickly. After he thought for a moment, the corners of his mouth curved up into a sly smile.</p>

  <p>"Since you say you're me, can you do this move?"</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zheng released the Wild God Power within his body, and his body began to grow at an alarming rate.</p>

  <p>This ice palace was only about two hundred feet high. At the rate Zheng's body was expanding, his head hit the ceiling of the palace in no time.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>A small crack appeared on the ceiling, which was made of ice crystals.</p>

  <p>Cra-aa-ck!</p>

  <p>That crack began to rapidly branch out to the entire ice palace.</p>

  <p>This scene finally wiped the indifferent expression off the phantom's face.</p>

  <p>Before this, it had been able to do everything that Zheng could. Growing, however, was something that it couldn't do.</p>

  <p>It squinted slightly, and suddenly, a soft voice came to its mind. "Stop him from destroying the ice palace!"</p>

  <p>"Roger that!" the phantom replied in its mind with a mental nod.</p>

  <p>Then, it took a step forward and suddenly leaped into the air.</p>

  <p>Crackle!</p>

  <p>A pair of thunder wings stretched out from its back.</p>

  <p>At the same time, it lifted the Shadow Bearing Sword and made a strange spiral in the air. The emotion in its eyes disappeared completely. Its internal momentum and the sword intent in the Shadow Bearing Sword merged at an alarming pace. "Emotion Closing Godly Way! Gods-intimidating Strike!" it roared.</p>

  <p>The huge ice palace was quickly crumbling under the pressure that Zheng was putting on it.</p>

  <p>By the time the phantom unleashed the Gods-intimidating Strike, Zheng's body had grown to more than a thousand feet.</p>

  <p>His legs had pierced through more than ten floors of the ice palace, and his head and shoulders had made a hole.</p>

  <p>As he grew larger and larger, Zheng's attention was still focused on the phantom.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew himself better than anyone else. As he watched the phantom leap up with the Shadow Bearing Sword, he could easily predict what it would do.</p>

  <p>"You are merely a fake." Zheng shouted coldly and waved his hand toward the phantom.</p>

  <p>The crystal clear ice blocks cracked further due to the explosive sound of his voice.</p>

  <p>Before the phantom could attack with its sword, it was slapped by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng had thrust his hand forward with all his might, releasing both the Wild God Power and his strength source.</p>

  <p>Even a Holy Being wouldn't be able to easily resist the power of such a slap!</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang...</p>

  <p>The phantom flew back like a kite off its string, smashing countless ice blocks directly into the depths of the ice palace.</p>

  <p>"This guy's body is as strong as mine..."</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng had managed to slap the phantom away, he didn't relax at all.</p>

  <p>He knew the secret of his physical body well, and the special part of the way to merge the Godly Ways. What kind of method had been used to conjure up this phantom that it could copy all of his attributes?</p>

  <p>The only attributes that it didn't seem to have copied were No. 9527 and the Wild God Power.</p>

  <p>"The Shadow Bearing Sword, the Ways-blending Energy, the strength source... these things were all obtained in the universe or in the divine land." At this point, Zheng seemed to figure out something. "The Wild God Power that I obtained outside the divine land was not copied."</p>

  <p>That was to say, there was someone who could create an almost exact replica of all the living creatures in the divine land.</p>

  <p>This conclusion made Zheng's back sweat. It was a truly formidable skill.</p>

  <p>"You might be right," No. 9527's voice sounded.</p>

  <p>"Do you also think so?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," No. 9527 replied. "Chiyou put the Reincarnation Land in the Abyss Demon Region because it is a very unique place that is different from the other forbidden lands. The Reincarnation Soul Weapon in the Reincarnation Land can reincarnate all the Memory Flames of the entire divine land. So how about the Sea of Meditation?"</p>

  <p>The sixth stage of the Abyss Demon Region was divided into three parts.</p>

  <p>The one in the middle was the Desperation Plain, which was the only way to get to the seventh stage of the Abyss Demon Region. On the right side of the Desperation Plain was the Reincarnation Land, and on the left side was the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>There was no way that this sea filled with dark water was as simple as it looked.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen probably had no idea about the real power or purpose of the Sea of Meditation.</p>

  <p>Splash!</p>

  <p>Zheng's huge body was stuck in the ice palace. He made a slight movement, causing countless ice blocks to tumble down one after another.</p>

  <p>"No matter what, I can still make a way!"</p>

  <p>After choosing a direction, he leaned back, tilted slightly, and suddenly punched forward!</p>

  <p>Boom! Bang!</p>

  <p>The destructive force of Zheng's punch was extremely terrifying. It had the power to make a hole that was dozens of miles in diameter.</p>

  <p>He believed that no matter how huge this ice palace was, he could break through it.</p>

  <p>However, when Zheng looked at the huge hole that was smashed out in front of him, he could still see milky white air surging in the distance.</p>

  <p>There was a trace of confusion on his face when he saw this scene.</p>

  <p>Was this ice palace hundreds of miles deep? How could anyone build such a huge ice palace?</p>

  <p>Swish! Swish...</p>

  <p>Zheng dispersed the Wild God Power in his body and once again launched the Thunder Materialization, flying along the huge hole at full speed.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, he reached the end of this huge hole.</p>

  <p>Zheng stood on the floor beside broken ice sculptures, and his face was set.</p>

  <p>He couldn't find the end of the ice palace at all. Behind the transparent wall, there were still layers of exquisite ice walls, as if they had no end and extended all the way to a place that he couldn't reach.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on?" Zheng immediately felt a throbbing in his head as he tried to wrap his mind around the situation.</p>

  <p>The creatures in the dark water had brought him to a freakish place.</p>

  <p>Even the knowledgeable No. 9527 couldn't see through it.</p>

  <p>After all, its deduction was based on the experience of constructing a world.</p>

  <p>And back when the masters at the Other Shore Realm had built worlds, things had been different. Chiyou's reason for building the Sea of Meditation or what power he had put in it was unknown.</p>

  <p>Zheng was still in a dilemma about how to proceed when a figure waddled over.</p>

  <p>It was none other than the phantom that he had slapped away a while ago.</p>

  <p>Although the phantom had been badly hurt, its recovery ability, just like Zheng's, was amazing. Leaning against an ice column, it smiled faintly and said, "Since my master wants you to stay here, you'd better stay obediently in the ice palace. It's impossible for you to leave."</p>
