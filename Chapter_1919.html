<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1919 Source Of Godly Tile </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>According to Holy Jay, this Godly Tile had an extremely special history.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a complete one, strictly speaking, but was actually a fragment of an enormous Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>One day, a creature used the Creating Axe to split open the chaos. From then on, the divine land was formed and numerous creatures appeared and began to multiply in the divine land. Some became True Gods, while some entered the Holy Realm and formed the universes.</p>

  <p>After countless divine eras, the divine land managed to develop on such a massive scale.</p>

  <p>The moment the Creating Axe split the divine land, three thousand great ways were formed for countless creatures to comprehend.</p>

  <p>As culture evolved, these three thousand great ways became the three thousand Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>One part of them were widespread across the world such as the Truth Divine Dao which served to continuously improve laws in the divine land. This was essential since one of the fundamental elements of being a True God was proficiency in all of the laws.</p>

  <p>Some Divine Dao, the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, for example, were considered forbidden.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, there were also some Divine Dao that each warrior could cultivate in divine land such as the Wishing Spell that could be used to save one's life.</p>

  <p>There was also a multitude of lost ways that failed to be passed down to the next generation and became dust in the course of history.</p>

  <p>If three thousand Divine Dao were practiced up to a perfect level, they could condense and form into various Godly Tiles. These Godly Tiles came in different shapes and had different abilities.</p>

  <p>Once condensed, a Godly Tile could never be shattered or broken. Even the Godly Tile of a low-rank True God could never be destroyed, not even under a Holy Being's most powerful attack.</p>

  <p>What these Godly Tiles truly were was still a disputed matter.</p>

  <p>There was no sure answer but most of the debates centered on a key man.</p>

  <p>The key man was the one who brandished his Creating Axe and developed the divine land.</p>

  <p>The truth could be hidden as time flew but traces would definitely still remain.</p>

  <p>The moment the divine land was opened, the Creating Axe was destroyed.</p>

  <p>Back then, the divine land was in a primitive state and there was no life anywhere. Who then wrote the legend of the Creating Axe?</p>

  <p>Who was the man that brandished the Creating Axe?</p>

  <p>In the center of the divine land was the boundless Time Sea. At the end of the Time Sea was a flat and massive plain.</p>

  <p>If one flew high enough, they'd be able to see the plain dotted with multiple cities and strongholds. These cities were the most prosperous places in the divine land and served as the location of the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The Hall of Holy Beings was like a bright pearl that emitted soft, bright rays.</p>

  <p>However, the most attractive ones were the great craters instead of the cities.</p>

  <p>These craters were all connected to each other and had a silhouette of a man.</p>

  <p>It was possible to distinguish the head, the belly, and the legs...</p>

  <p>This spot was the birthplace of the divine land and also where the Creating Axe disappeared along with its wielder. All that remained were these craters where the man used to lie.</p>

  <p>That was the generally accepted theory.</p>

  <p>Most people believed that the man had left the divine land, while others thought he had merged with the land itself. It was around the middle ages when the man left the divine land and vanished.</p>

  <p>At the later stage of the middle ages, two Holy Beings initiated a war that made this vast expanse of the plain heave. It was there that they found a prodigious Godly Tile in one of the craters.</p>

  <p>This Godly Tile was different than the others. It could adapt its own characteristics according to the holder's imagination.</p>

  <p>If its holder imagined it to be extremely strong then it would become impregnable. If it was imagined to be supple then it would become as soft as cotton.</p>

  <p>People then began to call it as the source of Godly Tile wherein the Godly Tiles that were used to create three thousand great ways could most probably be derived from.</p>

  <p>This Godly Tile could merge with all other tiles and reinforce a True God or a Holy Being to a great extent.</p>

  <p>It was an extremely precious treasure and blood surely spilled just to obtain it in the whole divine land.</p>

  <p>It was originally only a war between two Holy Beings but quickly escalated with every Holy Being getting involved.</p>

  <p>In the end, the prodigious Godly Tile was separated into countless small pieces and distributed among the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Some used their pieces for further study, others simply swallowed their pieces since that was the best way to improve themselves.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew was born after the war for that precious Godly Tile, so it was impossible for him to get one. Besides, even if he had been born earlier, there was still only a minuscule chance for him to have gotten a piece.</p>

  <p>People thought that the Godly Tile contained some information or secrets about three thousand Divine Dao, and some even alleged the lost Divine Dao were contained in this Godly Tile.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, none of those who kept the Godly Tile pieces for study ever found out anything. All they could do was to swallow them and leave them at that.</p>

  <p>The secrets of the source of Godly Tile remained veiled and the tile pieces became fewer and fewer.</p>

  <p>Ten thousand years ago, Holy Drew exchanged a top-level supreme chaotic weapon for a piece of the source of Godly Tile that once belonged to a Holy Being from the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>However, he also wasn't able to unlock any secrets.</p>

  <p>The Godly Tile could also be refined into a weapon but given the rarity of such a treasure, Holy Drew did not dare squander it arbitrarily.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be in a generous mood though since he took out this precious source of Godly Tile here. He initially did not want to waste it in refining a weapon.</p>

  <p>Instead, he decided to save it for the right occasion.</p>

  <p>And today was that right occasion. Holy Drew knew that cultivating Luo Luo Zheng was prerequisite at this stage.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew was a distinguished man in the divine land but his relationship with the Weapon Refining Association wasn't really good.</p>

  <p>There was a provisional compromise between the two but it didn't really address the root of the conflict.</p>

  <p>The Weapon Refining Association had long since demanded the method of supreme chaotic weapon refining from Holy Drew but the latter chose to ignore this request and imparted the method only to his two disciples.</p>

  <p>Why should he give them the method when they all laughed at him during his struggle? The process of refining supreme chaotic weapons was born out of his blood, sweat, and tears. He worked hard for his current success and there was no way he was going to hand it all over to them just like that.</p>

  <p>A few Holy Beings had vaguely mentioned this matter to him over the past hundred years. They all hoped that he would unveil the refining method in order to benefit the entirety of the whole divine land.</p>

  <p>It was quite a complicated position Holy Drew was in. Despite cultivating his eye into a small universe and being heralded as a member of the Hall of Holy Beings, Holy Drew still couldn't compete with the warriors who reached the Holy Realm. He didn't enter the Holy Realm, after all. There were still some considerable differences between his abilities and the powers of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The Hall of Holy Beings was always a united front. Its members had begged him for the publication of his method since all of them felt extremely envious of the supreme chaotic weapons he refined.</p>

  <p>There might come a time when the Weapon Refining Association and the Hall of Holy Beings would band together to force him to reveal his secrets. Although these institutions preached about rules, virtue, and morality, Holy Drew knew they were also people who did anything for their own benefit.</p>

  <p>It was only Holy Mike who had the gall to resist the Hall of Holy Beings outright.</p>

  <p>Holy Drew, who was outwardly respectable, did not have any kind of solid foundation or strong relationship with other Holy Beings in divine land.</p>

  <p>Mike and Bromley also helped him out before...</p>

  <p>Mike was probably dying now. It was only after Holy Jay found him and informed him of Mike's plan that Holy Drew's mind changed.</p>
