  <p>
</p>

  <p>The process of becoming a war general from a simple war fighter was quite a complex one. It was equivalent to making a breakthrough in the Illuminating Soul Realm and reaching the Internal Elixir Realm.</p>

  <p>However, it was not as easy as it sounded. If one wanted to take a significant leap forward and achieve the higher level, they would need to accumulate a considerable amount of Lucky Light.</p>

  <p>In the Tower of Sin, it was certain that warriors were capable of growing at an incredibly fast pace. Although this was the case, even those saint-level talents would need to temper themselves through continuous fighting before they could take a step further and attain a higher level.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that Zheng would be less likely to be spared from any challenge from now on and his speed of being promoted to the next floor drastically slowed down. Fortunately, the amount of light he had accumulated was steadily increasing. With a strategic planning, Zheng did not rush into refining all of the Lucky Light he had acquired. Instead, he gathered them together and planned to utilize them to break through to become a war general.</p>

  <p>In the hierarchy of the Tower of Sin, the martial artists on the seventh floor consisted of war generals ranging from the third level to the sixth level. As for the martial artists on the eighth floor, they were ranked marginally higher with them ranging from the fifth level up to the eighth level.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the ninth floor consisted of war generals of the seventh to tenth level.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, it was not much of a challenge for Zheng to conquer the first nine floors of the Tower of Sin with his current prowess and ability.</p>

  <p>In spite of this, the trouble arose at the fact that these war generals came to challenge him one after the other, rarely giving Zheng the chance to have a default victory. Naturally, he spent more energy than he intended to and thus, became more exhausted as time passed by.</p>

  <p>This was because in the perspective of the war generals, they had only granted the individuals who were 'war lord' level masters to get the default victory. Moreover, the fact persisted that the war lords were much stronger than them, while Zheng was just perceived to be a small war fighter. Although the strength he had displayed so far was indeed remarkable, he was not exceedingly strong that they felt daunted enough to not challenge him, or be fearful of his presence. Due to this conception, Zheng had to constantly rise to fight them.</p>

  <p>Whenever the young man stepped foot into the arena and saw that nobody came to the stage, he immediately assumed that he could be spared from being challenged that day. Unluckily, his days almost ended in the same way. Before the moment the time drew to its end, some reckless war general would appear out of nowhere and stand up to challenge him.</p>

  <p>Regardless, Zheng still managed to gain enough points to progressively climb to the higher floors of the tower.</p>

  <p>A full month had passed by when finally, Zheng entered the tenth floor of the Tower of Sin.</p>

  <p>From this floor onwards, Zheng would only be able to encounter two kinds of opponents, one of which were war generals with divine-level talent, and the latter being powerful war lords.</p>

  <p>With anticipation thrumming in his veins, Zheng spiritedly walked down the stairs and reached the tenth floor. Upon entering his destination, he noticed Olivia approaching him with a group of human warriors dawdling behind her. Sincerely smiling at the new arrival, Olivia said with vigor, "It took you one month to reach here, a little earlier than expected!"</p>

  <p>Chuckling, Zheng scratched his nape absent-mindedly and replied, "But I have expected to reach here earlier than this."</p>

  <p>"Follow me. After you enter the tenth floor, the opponents you are about to encounter will be much stronger than those you have battled before,"</p>

  <p>Olivia's eyes glinted as she stepped closer to Zheng and spoke with a gentle tone. As the woman moved closer, Zheng coughed awkwardly at the admittedly close proximity between them. At this distance, Zheng could smell the faint but sweet fragrance that seemed to cling to her body.</p>

  <p>The young man gave a brief nod and directed a wry smile towards her before following behind.</p>

  <p>The war general who went by the name of Dylon had kept his head drooped on one side. Pouting by himself, he was truly miserable but reluctantly admitted to himself that Zheng's strength was exceptional. This was due to the fact that the young warrior was powerful enough to catch the interest and attention of the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Up until that moment, Zheng's remained to be a tenth level war fighter.</p>

  <p>Impressively, there had never been such a warrior who could achieve such a feat in the human race. This was definitely an unbreakable record that would be talked about for decades to come. No one had achieved the astounding record before and the probability of another human fighter being able to surpass it in the future was low.</p>

  <p>What was even more inconceivable was that up until the present, Zheng had not displayed his full strength or all of his capabilities to his opponents.</p>

  <p>Whether it was to fight against a simple first level war general in the sixth floor, or the tenth level war general in the ninth floor, Zheng seemed to have the same poise and behavior. The young man remained calm and exuded composure while he defeated them with ease. Upon further inspection, it looked as if those war generals did not pose that much of a threat to him because he had not bothered to evoke his real strength.</p>

  <p>Within the span of a month, the stories that involved Zheng now spread like a storm that swept across the entire Sea God Continent. It came to the point wherein one would not be able to go anywhere without hearing someone uttering Zheng's name and exclaiming at his unbelievable accomplishments.</p>

  <p>Even if Zheng had not done anything purposefully for the name of the Purple Heart Sacred Place, truthfully, he had already contributed greatly to them in certain aspects. This was due to the fact that in the Purple Heart Sacred Place, they had been vigorously discussing almost daily about the human who suddenly showed up in the Tower of Sin and left them flabbergasted.</p>

  <p>In order to boost up the moral within the place, the human race had made sure to dutifully record the scenes of Zheng's battles with other races.</p>

  <p>Moreover, they proudly and religiously broadcast them through the Picture Slab that could be viewed by the entirety of the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>Therefore, although Zheng had never even stepped foot into the place, he had already become the role model for numerous human martial artists!</p>

  <p>The obsession for Zheng had continued to be unrelenting in the Purple Heart Sacred Place and there were absolutely no signs of it calming down in the slightest. On the contrary, Zheng became more and more of a heated topic in the sacred place. With every passing day, there were even rumors spreading like wildfire through word of mouth about Zheng possibly being the holy son of the human race. Little by little, such rumors enabled Zheng to become a legendary figure in their minds.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng had emerged, Dylon and Olivia appeared to be a perfect match in people's eyes. Moreover, those two individuals were regarded as the most talented among the younger generation in the Purple Heart Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>However, it was acquiesced by all of them that Olivia's talent was marginally stronger than Dylon's.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, with the arrival of Zheng and the humans marveling at his strength, both of them were overshadowed.</p>
