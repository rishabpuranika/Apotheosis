<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"You dream on it!" A Demi-holy Being from the Qin Clan sneered in contempt.</p>

  <p>Holy Beings could still be reborn even after they died in this place.</p>

  <p>Once Samuel killed all the Holy Beings present, he would need to start wars in the universes after he returned to the Floating Island of Han Clan.</p>

  <p>But regarding the launch of a universal war, a lot of restrictions had already been stated on the Ruling State.</p>

  <p>It would not be so easy to destroy a universe. Otherwise, Nicholas would not have tolerated the existence of the Evolutionary Universe for so many years.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>Samuel refuted as the long spear on his hand slightly trembled.</p>

  <p>His spear had once again created a space channel. The space channel didn't suck the blue eyed girl in. This time, only some ice flowers were implicated.</p>

  <p>Seeing Samuel's action, the Demi-holy Being was dumbfounded as the expression on his face changed drastically.</p>

  <p>He in turn had subconsciously wanted to escape, but when he was just less than a thousand feet away, a space fluctuation came from behind him.</p>

  <p>As the ice flowers were absorbed by the space channel, they were instantly made to be under the control of Samuel. He then used them to attack the Demi-holy Being, who was immediately frozen on the spot and was turned into an ice sculpture.</p>

  <p>Nicholas was enraged along with Murphy and the others as a flicker of anger was shown in their eyes. If they let Samuel continue to gain the upper hand, sooner or later he would kill all the members in the alliance of powerful clans.</p>

  <p>Their thoughts were proven right, because it was what Samuel had intended to do.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, back on the other side, the woman and Sword Chen were staring at the sea of fire.</p>

  <p>The red lotuses were constantly taking shape and after releasing blazing flames, they would disappear. The woman looked more and more furious as it went on repeatedly.</p>

  <p>She was originally born out of resentment. There was only one goal in her heart, which was to clean the divine land and then to marry Zheng to carry forward the bloodline of the Nine Li race!</p>

  <p>Because of what Samuel did, her plan could no longer succeed!</p>

  <p>Sword Chen on the side felt the change in the woman's emotion, and he was a little worried. He wondered how terrible it would be if this woman went crazy.</p>

  <p>She suddenly turned her head...</p>

  <p>Far away, Samuel's Spear of Supreme Harmony in his hand was continuously moving in the air.</p>

  <p>He created space channels one after another in the void, pulling out the ice flowers which kept attacking the people in the void.</p>

  <p>As they were attacked, the members of the alliance of powerful clans fled in all directions. Each one tried to avoid being hit.</p>

  <p>However, his Spear of Supreme Harmony was powerful. It could almost pierce the space that was infinitely far away. The others couldn't use the Grand Teleportation in the void, so how could they even escape?</p>

  <p>Samuel was ruthless.</p>

  <p>The woman observed and shifted her eyes away. Her gaze fell on Samuel's clone.</p>

  <p>Samuel's clone was just motionlessly floating in the air with the Spear of Supreme Harmony in his hand, waiting for her orders.</p>

  <p>"Send us there! I'm gonna kill him!" the woman then ordered, exasperated.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen who was beside her was a little confused.</p>

  <p>Now that Samuel and Nicholas were in a tangled melee, he thought that this should be a perfect opportunity for the woman to order the clones to attack the two girls so that she could control the True Demon Body.</p>

  <p>As soon as the woman gave the order, the clone thrust his spear at her!</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>An invisible space channel appeared to envelop her.</p>

  <p>The space channel created was wide enough that it didn't just encircle her, but all the clones of Nicholas, Clark and the other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>"Ha ha ha! The so-called geniuses of powerful clans on the Floating Islands, in my eyes, are just ants. Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Samuel slaughtered at will.</p>

  <p>Being the target of the oppression, the Demi-holy Beings and the consummate True Gods were scurrying in all directions. They tried their hardest but their speed was no match against the Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>He could build space channels as he wanted and could send the ice flowers of the blue eyed girl to anywhere!</p>

  <p>Every time he struck with his spear, there would be a person being frozen into an ice sculpture...</p>

  <p>"Run this way!"</p>

  <p>Shahn yelled as he quickly flew in the air. He felt a space fluctuation behind Walton and Troy.</p>

  <p>As soon as he uttered the words to remind them, a gust of ice flowers had swept toward them!</p>

  <p>"I..."</p>

  <p>Troy clenched his teeth in anger. His whole life's power had been fully gathered on his iron hand.</p>

  <p>But the energy in the ice flowers was too powerful...</p>

  <p>Even the internal momentum released by Holy Beings would soon quickly solidify and condense upon clashing against the energy from the ice flowers, not to mention that Troy was only a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>Walton was already feeling impassioned. Deep in his heart, he was actually planning on going all out. He was already on the verge of destructing his inner world. Even so, he was still a step behind. As soon as the ice flowers touched him, he found that he couldn't use the internal momentum in his inner world and he quickly turned into an ice sculpture.</p>

  <p>Shahn and Rachelle who stood not far away looked gloomy, but it didn't give them an excuse of stopping at all. They persisted in surviving, though they knew that if they were targeted by Samuel and were struck by him, they would have no chance of dodging.</p>

  <p>The members of the alliance of powerful clans died one after another...</p>

  <p>It was not long after only a few were left. Nicholas and the other Holy Beings who remained witnessed the scene in despair, their faces darkened even more.</p>

  <p>Samuel didn't attack the Holy Beings yet. Instead, he kept on aiming at the consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings!</p>

  <p>"Nicholas, how do you feel now?" Samuel eerily laughed and mocked. "Do you know how I felt when you killed the Stone Mouse, destroyed the Floating Island of our Yue Clan and destroyed my universe?" He wanted the Holy Beings to taste the pain he had suffered in the past!</p>

  <p>"Come on, let's fight him, Nicholas!" Murphy exclaimed, gritting his teeth.</p>

  <p>He looked over at her daughter, Rachelle who was standing far away. There were only a few people in the alliance of powerful clans that had remained.</p>

  <p>This time, he knew that Samuel would kill his daughter sooner or later.</p>

  <p>Zeke who was beside them couldn't stand it anymore. He stretched out his hands and a long purple jade sword instantly appeared!</p>

  <p>The long sword shone with an extremely sharp light, and unmistakably was also a supreme treasure of belief.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>With the purple jade sword in his hand, Zeke flew in a speed more than ten times faster. Even though he was far away from Samuel, he reached him in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>The purple jade sword had turned into a huge sword shadow. He fiercely slashed it at Samuel!</p>

  <p>"Will it work?"</p>

  <p>Samuel shook his head.</p>

  <p>With a slight shake of Spear of Supreme Harmony, he had already disappeared from the spot.</p>

  <p>The huge sword shadow formed by Zeke's purple jade long sword missed its target. Things got worse when another space channel came towards him.</p>

  <p>He gritted his teeth and was able to detect the danger. He acted fast and threw the purple jade sword upward!</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Once the purple jade sword was out of his hand, it grew larger in the wind and turned into a huge sword. It had then blocked all the ice flowers above his head.</p>

  <p>It gave him the time to rush to the other side and helped him escape successfully.</p>

  <p>However, the purple jade sword thrown upwards was already covered with a layer of ice flowers. It was rendered useless now.</p>

  <p>After Samuel disappeared from the spot, he reappeared in the space a thousand feet away.</p>

  <p>With his current means, it was not difficult for him to eliminate Zeke. It was surely an easy feat for him, and the only person he was still wary of was Nicholas.</p>

  <p>When he went through Nicholas's memory, he found out some secrets about time. One way or another, he was cautious of any movement from Nicholas.</p>

  <p>Even after all of this, he noticed that Nicholas hadn't taken any serious move yet. He decided to just ignore him and continued slaughtering. He thought when he killed Troy too, Nicholas would be finally enraged.</p>

  <p>However, as he was obsessed in killing, he completely ignored another person. He forgot about the woman.</p>

  <p>As soon as he came out of the space, he felt a space fluctuation behind him.</p>

  <p>He looked back and saw the woman coming out of a space channel. He was caught off guard as she straight away pounced at him.</p>
