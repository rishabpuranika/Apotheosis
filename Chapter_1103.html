<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1103 Fiona Huo </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>War Emperor York, Turner, and even the ruler of the Wind Divine Kingdom all still wanted to further improve their cultivation to a higher level.</p>

  <p>Limited by the Lower World's resources, many of the powerful martial artists of the Soul Sea Realm couldn't get past that hurdle.</p>

  <p>Having such a special talent, the little monster naturally grabbed everyone's attention. To all the divine kingdoms, he was a real treasure.</p>

  <p>His status gave him the privilege to be so unbridled, doing anything he wanted. No one would dare to give him any problems.</p>

  <p>Back then, in the York Divine Kingdom, he had taken a fancy to an unsurpassed harlot in a brothel and ended up fighting a talented prince.</p>

  <p>In a fit of anger, he took the prince's life.</p>

  <p>The prince was only second to the crown prince, above even Daniel.</p>

  <p>After he was killed, War Emperor York was utterly furious, but he didn't do anything to the little monster.</p>

  <p>After a moment of thought, Marine looked at Luo Zheng as he floated in the air.</p>

  <p>With a bite of her lips, she finally replied, "Yes, I want you to fight in my place!"</p>

  <p>"No problem." The little monster bared his teeth in a wicked grin. Paired with his strange black pupils, he was the embodiment of a humanoid monster. Rubbing his hands mischievously, he moved closer to Marine and began sniffing. "I want something back."</p>

  <p>The vile-sounding words gave Marine an awful premonition. The monster must have had some preposterous ideas in mind.</p>

  <p>"What do you want in return?"</p>

  <p>Lowering her voice, she asked anyway.</p>

  <p>Still rubbing his hands together, the monster spoke to her through his life vitality, not letting another soul hear their exchange.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Marine's face reddened before she angrily scolded the creature, "Do you have a death wish, little monster?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't a surprise for him to make such an unbearable request. At the very least, the monster knew well enough to speak of such a taboo secretly through life vitality. If anyone else had heard it, it would have made a great influence on the secret sect.</p>

  <p>His request was rather simple. He wanted to sleep with her, just once.</p>

  <p>How could she ever agree to such a request?</p>

  <p>After getting the hint that she was truly angry, the little monster restrained himself. "It's fine if you don't agree to that request. But the next time the Reverse Spirit Channel opens, if there's anything good released from the Upper World, would you let me choose first?"</p>

  <p>He spoke of the ability of the secret sect.</p>

  <p>It was also the reason why the four divine kingdoms supported the sect.</p>

  <p>Even the rulers had to be respectful toward Marine.</p>

  <p>Only the secret sect could connect with the humans in the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Every few years, the Upper World would distribute treasures through the Reverse Spirit Channel. These things, however, weren't given out for free. The secret sect in the Upper World hoped that the four divine kingdoms could enter the Feather Holy Sea and pick out the most important things from inside.</p>

  <p>Normally, after the Reverse Spirit Channel was opened, the four divine kingdoms' rulers would select the treasures first. But it was Marine who had the final say in the treasure distribution.</p>

  <p>The little monster's request was excessive, but it was still acceptable.</p>

  <p>After all, the Reverse Spirit Channel didn't only pass down treasures, but many pills for cultivation. Many of the Soul Sea Realm masters looked forward to the little monster breaking through to the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>After some hesitation, she finally nodded. "Alright!"</p>

  <p>"Good. I'll help you kill him later, then." With that, the monster seemed to ignore the crowd and even Luo Zheng above him, and once again found an open space before turning over and falling asleep.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing the monster's words of agreement, Marine looked up at Luo Zheng in the sky, her thin lips curling up into a sneer. 'Luo Zheng, I said that I would kill you. Even after three years, you won't be able to escape, ' she thought firmly to herself.</p>

  <p>All the while, Luo Zheng remained standing in the air. None of the martial artists came to challenge him, so he had a clear view of the scene on the square.</p>

  <p>Though Zheng's expression remained neutral, he was on guard after witnessing how arrogant the little monster was.</p>

  <p>Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artists weren't stupid. Many of those who were proud and arrogant weren't just all talk— they were powerful.</p>

  <p>Marine's sneer made it clear that she was very confident in the little monster's power.</p>

  <p>After Logan was defeated, it was the Star Field Divine Kingdom or Wind Divine Kingdom's turn to send their martial artists to fight.</p>

  <p>Both kingdoms remained silent.</p>

  <p>'So no one dares to challenge me?' Luo Zheng thought. Floating in the air in silence, he was baffled. How should he proceed with the next battle, in that case?</p>

  <p>There were only twenty to thirty martial artists on the first tier of the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>Among those, Logan was considered the best of the best. Titus, Edwin, Gregory, and the others all suffered a crushing defeat in his hands. There was no doubt about his raw power.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, though, such a strong contender was defeated all too easily by Luo Zheng. Witnessing such strength, none of the martial artists was willing to fight him. The difference in strength was too great.</p>

  <p>Of course, it was not that no one from the younger generation dared to step forward. The strength of many princes and crown princes couldn't be underestimated. They had either inherited some sort of bloodline of talent, cultivated some strange cultivation methods, or had precious treasures and secret techniques under their wing.</p>

  <p>But how could the royal families fight so easily?</p>

  <p>"Who else wants to challenge Tianxing?" Turner asked with an evident smirk on his face.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the War King Wind, who had been silent all the while, finally spoke, "Fiona, if you really want to give it a try, then go on and fight him. You can stop when you want to."</p>

  <p>With that, everyone heard a feminine voice reply, "Okay, father."</p>

  <p>In an instant, a woman, her hair long and flowing like a waterfall, walked out from behind the king.</p>

  <p>Her braided hair reached down to her ankles, looking rather astonishing.</p>

  <p>"She's the young princess of the Wind Divine Kingdom! The royal family is actually going to fight!"</p>

  <p>"It's been years since I saw the royal family take part in a fight last time."</p>

  <p>"Generally speaking, they don't, right?"</p>

  <p>In such a situation, where no one else was willing to fight, the princess of the Wind Divine Kingdom actually stepped out. It was something far beyond anyone's expectations.</p>

  <p>The Wind Divine Kingdom was under the Huo family's rule. This young princess, Fiona Huo, was quite powerful.</p>

  <p>It was said that she was the most talented martial artist in the royal family. Because of her power, the crown prince in the Wind Divine Kingdom was abolished.</p>

  <p>Martial artists were always rated by their strength. Although Fiona was a woman, if she could grow strong enough to reach the Soul Sea Realm in the future, she could take on the position of War King Wind and become an empress in her own right.</p>

  <p>In the history of the kingdoms, there hadn't yet been any woman to ascend to the throne. But because of Fiona's strength, people believed she was likely to break that streak and become the very first empress of the four kingdoms.</p>

  <p>But her looks were rather deceiving— she seemed weak and delicate. In fact, her demeanor was quite charming, indeed. As she gently turned around, circles of fire lotuses appeared beneath her feet. Stepping onto those fire flowers, she gracefully floated over.</p>

  <p>After entering the enchanted barrier, she sweetly smiled, and a faint light began circulating between her eyebrows. "I am Fiona Huo!"</p>

  <p>The introduction made Zheng's brows shoot up. He didn't expect Fiona to be so polite as a princess. He replied in kind, "I am Tianxing Luo."</p>

  <p>"My father said that it's shameful for a member of the royal family to fight personally. But in my opinion, my father rules the kingdom, not because of his dignity, but his true strength. If he wasn't powerful enough to convince his people, there would be no use in worrying about his image," Fiona carefully explained.</p>

  <p>Her voice was as soft and gentle as sweet spring water. It was all too comforting to listen to.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't agree more," Luo Zheng answered with a nod of his head.</p>

  <p>All fame was backed by strength. Without strength, it was rootless duckweed and water without a source. A bubble reputation was never even worth mentioning.</p>

  <p>"I wish to spar with you," Fiona said with a graceful smile.</p>

  <p>"I am deeply honored to be able to battle with the princess of the Wind Divine Kingdom," Luo Zheng said without hesitation. Initially, Luo Zheng believed that they would begin to fight right after their conversation.</p>

  <p>Much to his surprise, when Fiona saw the sleeping little monster in the square, a trace of fear flashed across her face. She then said to Luo Zheng, lowering her voice, "Listen, after our fight, everything will be fine if you lose. However, if you defeat me, you must pretend to have lost to me."</p>
