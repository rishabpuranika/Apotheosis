<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3213 A Little Trick </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng could trace hints of doubts in the faces of Athemar, Goran and others when he told them about the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>They also wanted to acquire all of the Truth Enlightenment, but they didn't want to force Zheng by using the method of soul searching.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng said he only had one hundred and fifty words, they believed what he said.</p>

  <p>But the Vastness Mountain people were different. The woman in red insisted on the complete version, and they didn't believe Zheng when he said he had only deciphered one hundred and fifty words.</p>

  <p>She had been preparing even before Zheng's arrival.</p>

  <p>"Have you made up your mind? Do you want to write the complete chapter down yourself or do you need us to use force?" She stared at Zheng with ice cold eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng's brows furrowed as he remarked, "I only have one hundred and fifty words. It will take me years before I could decipher the whole thing. Even if I do, I will only give it to Eastern Emperor Taiyi and he will be the one to share it with the whole Oneness Sky Palace. You don't think he won't give it to the Vastness Mountain, do you?"</p>

  <p>He wondered why the woman was in such a hurry.</p>

  <p>The woman ignored Zheng. She swiftly turned to the man in black. "Arjun, do it!" she ordered.</p>

  <p>The man ran straight to Zheng, and the green hand above his head charged towards him too.</p>

  <p>How could Zheng agree?</p>

  <p>He had plenty of secrets, not just the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>His secrets included the Chaos Ancient God, the divine land, Geoffrey's talent in deciphering the Sanskrit words, the Nine Li race and so on.</p>

  <p>He would bring these secrets with him to his grave.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng kicked the floor and abruptly flew backward.</p>

  <p>When he moved less than ten feet, the woman waved her hand gently.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng was back where he had been.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Zheng attempted to flee again.</p>

  <p>The trick repeated itself. Zheng would barely reach ten feet before he found himself back on the floor.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt like there was an invisible force around him. No matter how hard he tried, he just kept spinning back to his spot.</p>

  <p>"Young man, stop struggling," the woman said with a sinister smile.</p>

  <p>Arjun reached Zheng and pressed him with his green hand. Zheng felt anxiety spin in his stomach.</p>

  <p>Zheng closed his eyes and the voice of No. 9527 filled his consciousness.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, it's just the Soul Searching Hand. Let him do it."</p>

  <p>"Do you have a solution?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course," No. 9527 answered positively. "Just relax. He won't find anything."</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was a wisp of its master's soul. It didn't contribute to Zheng's strength in battle, but it had endless methods to deal with one's soul. Hence, Zheng felt relieved with its words of assurance.</p>

  <p>Of course, he still looked very nervous on the surface.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>As Arjun approached Zheng, the Soul Searching Hand grabbed Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>All of the five fingers sprawled neatly on his head.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a whirlpool stir inside him. The soul aura was coming straight to his mind.</p>

  <p>Inside him, No. 9527 was also making its move. Zheng started to feel numbness in his soul. His mind was slowing down; he stood blankly, allowing the Soul Searching Hand to interrogate him.</p>

  <p>Arjun wore an evil smile on his face. Green mist rolled on the surface of the Soul Searching Hand as it emitted a green glow.</p>

  <p>He was gradually sucking Zheng's memories to the point that he would remember some of Zheng's memories as his own.</p>

  <p>"Have you found it?" the woman asked Arjun. "Do you need a brush and ink to write it down?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Arjun replied.</p>

  <p>Countless memories entered his mind.</p>

  <p>The memory of a beggar's life...</p>

  <p>A butterfly stuck in a spider's web...</p>

  <p>Even the evolution of a world...</p>

  <p>Arjun's face curled into a confused expression. From what he knew, a person's memories would be arranged chronologically as they occurred— from one's childhood to adulthood.</p>

  <p>But why were Zheng's memories so haphazardly arranged?</p>

  <p>"I find some special memory fragments,"</p>

  <p>Arjun declared as he found some memory fragments with special shapes.</p>

  <p>Normally, he would ignore these and would only focus on acquiring what he needed to know. However, he wasn't able to find anything valuable in Zheng's soul so his attention was all on the memory fragments.</p>

  <p>He read the first memory fragment. Suddenly, a look of shock covered his face.</p>

  <p>Those were the first ten-odd words of the Truth Enlightenment!</p>

  <p>It seemed like the words were scattered across memory fragments for some reason.</p>

  <p>Arjun could not comprehend how and why that would happen, but he made sure to not let that chance go.</p>

  <p>He transferred Zheng's memory fragments into his own soul and tried to read through them as if they were his own.</p>

  <p>As he was doing so, his eyes widened and his body began to tremble. His face suddenly turned ghostly pale.</p>

  <p>"What? There are too many memory fragments. Damn it!" Arjun began to talk nonsense.</p>

  <p>"Arjun, what's wrong with you?" The woman approached his trembling body.</p>

  <p>Other men in the room shared puzzled looks.</p>

  <p>Arjun wasn't the strongest among them, but he had the unique and important ability of the Soul Searching Hand. He had solved difficult problems in the past with that ability. What was his problem with Zheng?</p>

  <p>Arjun dragged his own body away and retreated. After a few steps, he passed out and collapsed to the floor.</p>

  <p>Zheng recovered to his normal state. When he saw Arjun lying on the floor, he let out a genuine gasp. "No. 9527, what did you do?" he asked in his mind.</p>

  <p>Arjun's soul was much stronger than Zheng's. Even if No. 9527 was a wisp of Chaos Ancient God's soul, it would take a whole lot of effort to cause Arjun to suffer that much.</p>

  <p>"I didn't do anything special. He likes searching people's souls, right? So I simply overwhelmed him with countless memories. His soul wasn't able to handle so many," No. 9527 said with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>At first, it resembled the Chaos Ancient God in character. Now, since it had been with Zheng for a long time, its own self-consciousness had evolved. It started to gain unique character traits. The Chaos Ancient God himself would never use such a little trick.</p>

  <p>The memory fragments were a trap arranged by No. 9527 on purpose. It wanted to fool Arjun into thinking there was important information in the fragments.</p>

  <p>The memory fragments covered a long timeline. No. 9527 made sure to include memories of the birth of chaos. Apart from the overwhelming quantity, the memories were also useless for humans as they did not have the ability to interpret them anyway.</p>

  <p>A human's feeble attempt to interpret them would cause immense pain to their soul.</p>
