<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3593 Descend </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, Murkub couldn't see what was happening on the other side.</p>

  <p>What he saw was only a blurry white light ball that appeared above the array.</p>

  <p>He clearly knew that the white light ball represented that certain powerful race.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the reason the Elephant Man race had survived on Stage Seventeen until now was also because of that powerful race.</p>

  <p>It could be said that the light ball was like God who had saved the Elephant Man race.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, Murkub gestured and signaled all the Elephant Men to kneel down.</p>

  <p>In turn, all of them including Richie, knelt on the ground and devoutly bowed to the white light ball.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the water spirit, or the gathering of the many Element Spirits that were on Stage Thirty-two watched the scene rather impatiently.</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race were known for being the purest creatures, as all of them were made up of the most basic elements.</p>

  <p>For them, all living creatures with flesh and blood were filthy and impure!</p>

  <p>Of course, the Elephant Man race were no exception.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" the water spirit asked. Although the water spirit had convened its companions, it was still the owner of the body where everyone was gathered.</p>

  <p>Thus, out of politeness, it should be the one to speak first.</p>

  <p>"I saw the Other Shore Key! It's the one to this place!" Murkub exclaimed.</p>

  <p>He placed the board in a vertical position and pointed to the right side of it, which was the area shaped like a triple-gourd.</p>

  <p>As soon as Murkub finished speaking, the consciousnesses inside the body of the water spirit began to fluctuate.</p>

  <p>"Is it the temple in the past?"</p>

  <p>"Has the key to the temple finally appeared?"</p>

  <p>"We had tried every way we had to enter it at that time--but those forces had fought for so many years, and no one ever succeeded in the end!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed... and now, we finally got this great opportunity!"</p>

  <p>The Element Spirit race quietly communicated with each other immediately through their consciousness. In just about three seconds, they had already talked about the past of Stage Seventeen.</p>

  <p>Back then, the Element Spirit race, along with two other forces, had all obtained the position of the ruler of Stage Seventeen. At that time, the Element Spirit race had also thought that only they could dig out the thing in that dangerous place, but in the end they just failed.</p>

  <p>However, the failure of the other two forces made the Element Spirit race feel relieved, so the exploration of the dangerous place in Stage Seventeen was then put aside.</p>

  <p>The only reason the Element Spirit race had casually supported the Elephant Man race on Stage Seventeen was so the latter could work for them.</p>

  <p>If ever the Other Shore Key appeared one day, they would naturally know at the first time.</p>

  <p>Truth be told, the Element Spirit race didn't have much hope that the Elephant Man race would discover anything. They even almost forgot about the Elephant Man race for a long time, until their race's high priest, Murkub, had crushed the Heavenly Spirit Bead. "What should we do? Let those monkeys think of a solution?" a fire spirit asked.</p>

  <p>"Humph! Those monkeys can only hide in the darkness. What's their use anyway? They had screwed things up on Stage Fourteen not long ago. They couldn't do anything right!" a metal spirit complained.</p>

  <p>"The key point is that the monkeys are not strong enough, and the purified being of Stage Seventeen is not under our control. I'm afraid we can only let the Moon Fire Slaves go down there..." the water spirit suggested.</p>

  <p>There were no doubts about the strength of the Moon Fire Slaves, but if they directly went down from Stage Thirty-two, then there would be a great price to pay. Furthermore, the strength of the Moon Fire Slaves would also be greatly reduced.</p>

  <p>The Moon Fire Slaves normally did not appear in areas lower than Stage Thirty, but such an opportunity was rare and hard to get--which was why the Element Spirit race found it worthy of their great attention.</p>

  <p>When the other members of the Element Spirit race hesitated, a fire spirit asked, "Which race does the creature who holds the Other Shore Key belong to?"</p>

  <p>Murkub, who stayed in the metal array while he waited for the light ball's orders, had heard the light ball's question and answered honestly, "Humans, two of them to be exact. There is one of them whose face I couldn't see clearly, but he can be as tall as us when his Wild God body is activated..."</p>

  <p>The news about what Luo Zheng and Feng Ge did on Stage Fourteen had spread widely. The Element Spirit race also knew about it, but they did not pay much attention.</p>

  <p>As soon as Murkub finished speaking, the Element Spirits immediately understood what had happened.</p>

  <p>It turned out that the human who had occupied Stage Fourteen had now stepped into Stage Seventeen.</p>

  <p>Moreover, this human happened to have the Other Shore Key. They knew that it was not a coincidence!</p>

  <p>"Make the Moon Fire Slaves descend!"</p>

  <p>"I agree!"</p>

  <p>"I agree!"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>Not long after, the door of the hall opened from the middle.</p>

  <p>Three huge Moon Fire Slaves walked forward, and the entire hall trembled slightly with their footsteps.</p>

  <p>Green flames spread from their necks, waists, and ribs, and the fierce and tyrannical aura they emitted was very palpable.</p>

  <p>As soon as the three Moon Fire Slaves stood in the center of the metal array, the metal array began to rotate again.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>As the metal array spun wildly, they turned into a white ray of light and eventually flew straight towards Stage Thirty-one. There were traces of dark green flames that were visible in the white light.</p>

  <p>Some powerful creatures that lived on Stage Thirty-one and Thirty-two saw the dark green flames and immediately knew what the Element Spirit race were doing. They were bringing karma fire and calamity to a lower stage again.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Moon Fire Slaves descended all the way to Stage Thirty-one.</p>

  <p>Stage Thirty...</p>

  <p>Stage Twenty-nine...</p>

  <p>Stage Eighteen...</p>

  <p>Until they finally reached Stage Seventeen!</p>

  <p>While all of those were happening, the Elephant Men were still on their knees.</p>

  <p>To the ignorant and backward Elephant Man race, that ball of white light was the manifestation of God. As long as it was there, they did not dare to leave without permission.</p>

  <p>Most of the Elephant Men deeply revered and were highly devoted to the God. They thought that since the God had manifested himself, then would the God bless them with graces?</p>

  <p>As they hoped and waited, a white and green beam of light was cast down.</p>

  <p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p>

  <p>The second the white and green light shone down, it destroyed the entire array into pieces. The damage in the center of the array left a crater with a diameter of five thousand feet!</p>

  <p>If it had been in a normal world of humans, that crater would be unimaginably huge.</p>

  <p>However, the Elephant Man race were all over ten thousand feet tall. Thus, the huge crater was only the same size as the water tanks they used.</p>

  <p>Just then, three huge Moon Fire Slaves slowly crawled out of it.</p>

  <p>Once they had fully gotten out and saw the Elephant Men who were much bigger than them, they were rendered speechless.</p>

  <p>It was true that they had a towering height of about three hundred feet, but they were nothing compared to the Elephant Men who were over ten thousand feet tall.</p>

  <p>"Well, the repressive force of Stage Seventeen hasn't come yet," said one of the Moon Fire Slaves.</p>

  <p>"How should we deal with these Elephant Men?"</p>

  <p>"How? They might already be dead..."</p>

  <p>When Stage Seventeen did not suppress the power of the Moon Fire Slaves, they were as strong as they had been on Stage Thirty-two. In fact, the shock waves of the flames their bodies released were enough to burn everything on Stage Seventeen.</p>

  <p>As for Richie, Murkub, and the Elephant Men who stood closest to the Moon Fire Slaves, they were oblivious to what had happened. They only felt that a heatwave had washed over them, until they completely lost consciousness and their bodies had turned into coke.</p>
