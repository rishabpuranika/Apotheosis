<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 409 The Antique Gentleman Sword (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Seeing the demonic fist dashing towards him, Vale raised his eyebrows, and waved his hands to summon his own weapons. Hundreds of lotus flowers fluttered in front of him, products of his own martial skills.</p>

  <p>This was far from their first fight. At one point, Vale was attacked by Luo Zheng's fists on Hell Mountain. At that time Luo Luo Zheng was just a half step into the nature level, but his fists helped even the odds. It was a reckless move, though.</p>

  <p>The little boy, a novice only a half step into the nature level, had the nerve to start a fight with him! Vale was stunned and bewildered. Why would Luo Luo Zheng do such a thing? But still, he had to admit those fists were a pretty impressive feat, especially for one so young.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng was only half-step into the nature level, he could use life energy to throw those powerful fists. Now that Luo Luo Zheng stepped fully into the nature level, his life energy had been transformed into life vitality. So his fists were bound to be more compact, heavier and more powerful!</p>

  <p>Vale Wang was also a rare genius, and now he was the pride of the Wang Family. Not only was he a personal disciple, he stood head and shoulders above those other personal disciples. How could it be easy to fight him?</p>

  <p>And he'd come up with a way to defend against Luo Zheng's Heavenly Ogre Fist.</p>

  <p>The lotus flowers floating around him formed a triangle, and there was a big gap between any two of the hundred lotus blossoms. With his power, he sent the triangle rushing headlong at Luo Zheng's fists.</p>

  <p>The moment the fists met the lotus flowers, the phantoms began to devour the blossoms in the front row. Immediately, the gorgeous red, lotus arrangement was transformed by the demonic life vitality, one flower after another.</p>

  <p>In fact, in the previous competition between Luo Luo Zheng and Dick, Luo Luo Zheng had shown off the devouring power of his demonic life vitality. But, back then, most of the audience saw nothing out of the ordinary. Dick was the only one who saw everything clearly.</p>

  <p>Back then, Luo Zheng's demonic phantom was transformed into life vitality to consume the life vitality powering Dick's Righteousness Song, making many people believe that they were using life vitality to compete with each other.</p>

  <p>Only Dick himself understood what was going on? the horrible power of Luo Zheng's demonic life vitality. The truth was that Luo Zheng's life vitality was devouring his Righteousness Song. It took a bit to get through the golden layer of righteousness on the surface. If it didn't have that protective layer, it would be swallowed by Luo Zheng's demonic life vitality within a second!</p>

  <p>The spectators weren't aware of how the demonic life vitality was used, but now they had a first hand education, as the red lotus flowers were devoured by the demonic black phantoms, turning them into black, twisted versions of themselves.</p>

  <p>"What? Black lotus flowers?" one disciple asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Those lotus flowers seem to be the same color as Luo Zheng's life vitality! Oh, no, Luo Zheng's controlling the lotus flowers!" another disciple yelled anxiously.</p>

  <p>"It's true! But what's really going on is that Luo Zheng's life vitality is devouring the lotus flowers. How did Luo Luo Zheng manage that?" his fellow disciple said. "Why his cultivation method so weird? Not only it can reshape life vitality automatically after it is shattered, but also it can use his life vitality to devour other people's life vitality. Anyone who has this kind of power is invincible." "That's incredible!" one more disciple added, astonished.</p>

  <p>"I thought Luo Luo Zheng would suffer a crashing defeat when his rival was Vale, but now it seems that I jumped to that conclusion too early! Still, Vale's technique is pretty solid. He knew Luo Zheng's life vitality could devour his lotus flowers. You see the big gap between each lotus flower in the back of the arrangement? That makes it hard for Luo Luo Zheng to devour them all at once." One more senior disciple made his analysis. He was obviously thrilled.</p>

  <p>As the saying goes, laymen watch what's going on, while insiders figure out why. Some only saw the lotus flowers changed color; some could see that Vale's lotus flowers were devoured by Luo Zheng's life vitality while others figured out Vale had a way to deal with all this.</p>

  <p>"If I hadn't studied your technique, I probably would have fallen to it.</p>

  <p>But now? A wise man learns from his mistakes. A wiser man learns from others!" Vale said in a cold tone, gesturing at the lotus flowers in front of him. At the same time, all the lotus flowers abruptly bloomed.</p>

  <p>"Boom..."</p>

  <p>When a single red lotus flower burst, the energy it generated was terrifying. Now that dozens of lotus flowers burst at the same time, the turbulent red lotus fire immediately enveloped Luo Zheng's fist phantoms and the black lotus flowers which had been devoured by his phantoms. The flames eagerly curled each flower to ashes.</p>

  <p>Detonating his own lotus flowers and Luo Zheng's fist phantoms together was also Vale's last ditch. He was really out of options. Luo Zheng's black fist phantoms were too evil and too powerful. After Vale thought about it for a bit, there was no other way to break through.</p>

  <p>Now even after he had come up with a solution, Vale just managed to hold Luo Luo Zheng to a draw.</p>

  <p>If he hadn't done this, the life vitality contained in Luo Zheng's fist phantoms could have devoured all of his lotus flowers. And if that happened, he would definitely be defeated!</p>

  <p>"I've broken through your fists. Got any more tricks up your sleeves?"</p>

  <p>Vale said lightly, as more lotus flowers started blooming next to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's cultivation method was a rare one. But Vale's knowledge of the Lotus Scriptures was considerable, and he also had the advantage in the cultivation level. So, Vale was very confident right now.</p>
