<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Under the influence of the Stasis Extreme Form, Zheng wasn't able to think straight.</p>

  <p>He heard the words of the Evil God, but he couldn't fully comprehend them.</p>

  <p>After a while, the Evil God stretched out his hand and drew a circle again in the air. Then, the hexagonal snowflake that was broken and spread out earlier gradually emerged and reorganized into the circle. As it was completely restored, Zheng was able to return to normal.</p>

  <p>The moment he came back to his senses, the Evil God's words from before drilled into his mind. At the same time, he noticed that the Evil God was now approaching him.</p>

  <p>"Stasis Extreme Form?"</p>

  <p>Zheng's expression changed drastically as he realized how dreadful the skill was.</p>

  <p>He was wondering why the ancestry-level bloodline couldn't restrain its power. Never did he expect that the Evil God would be able to use the power of the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>The Evil God didn't say anything and just looked at him with a playful smile. He was enjoying this moment when he could clearly see the bewilderment on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>He remembered Zheng once told him that there was a much wider world outside. He thought that he must probably have the same flabbergasted expression on his face. But now, it was Zheng's turn to experience it.</p>

  <p>"How did you obtain such a level of power?" Zheng couldn't help but ask him without hesitation.</p>

  <p>The Evil God fiddled with the hexagonal snowflake and asked teasingly,</p>

  <p>"Do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," Zheng replied quickly.</p>

  <p>"Join us, and I'll tell you," the Evil God said with a conniving smile.</p>

  <p>"Forget it then," Zheng answered sternly.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing his immediate reply, the Evil God placed the hexagonal snowflake in front of Zheng. He wasn't willing to take no for an answer that quickly. "I heard that you have fought with the downgrader. You should know by now what kind of power he possesses. If you can't even resist my power, then you definitely have no chance against him. Even if you rely on your primitive land, nothing would change. You will die with everyone. But if you follow me, I can save you! I can save everyone around you!"</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't understand where the fanaticism in the eyes of the Evil God was coming from. It was as if saving him meant saving the whole world.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng just dismissed him by saying, "I don't need you to save me."</p>

  <p>After deeming that they had nothing more to talk about, Zheng turned around and was ready to leave. The flying ship that he used was destroyed by the Evil God earlier, so he needed the Grand Teleportation skill to return to the primitive land.</p>

  <p>However, just when he was about to enter the space channel, the Evil God swiftly grabbed and crushed it, preventing Zheng from leaving. "Aren't you afraid of death?!" the Evil God yelled through gritted teeth.</p>

  <p>"Why should I be afraid?" Zheng retorted with a cold stare.</p>

  <p>"Then tell me, what is the meaning of my existence?" This time, it seemed that the Evil God was discombobulated.</p>

  <p>Zheng felt a little confused as he saw the strange expression on the Evil God's face.</p>

  <p>"I have all his memories, and all my talents and power are here to serve him. But I'm still who I am! Isn't that weird? Is this just the entire meaning of my life?" the Evil God asked with a gloomy expression.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Zheng and the Evil God were just avatars of their real selves. However, Zheng's avatar was fully connected to his real self, while the Evil God's avatar possessed his own train of thoughts. He could move and think independently from the will of his real self.</p>

  <p>"I can't answer that for you. You'll have to ask the Evil God," Zheng said as he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Then let me go with you! I don't want to go back and act like a mere slave. Besides, I can teach you how to transform power into a higher level!" the Evil God roared in a desperate tone.</p>

  <p>Then, Zheng looked at the Evil God intently. He couldn't believe that this avatar could act this way. He found that this avatar of the Evil God was a bit too emotional.</p>

  <p>It was actually a good thing because he could make use of him.</p>

  <p>But just as Zheng made his decision to let the avatar go with him, an unknown black spiral suddenly pierced through the void.</p>

  <p>This black spiral then transformed into a massive spear that was over ten thousand feet long. Moreover, it turned out that its target was the Evil God.</p>

  <p>The Evil God quickly sensed the danger that it brought. He immediately lifted the hexagonal snowflake in his hand and pointed it towards the black spear. The snowflake was already about to break, but the black spear was unimaginably faster.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>With a muffled sound, the Evil God's head was suddenly pierced by the black spear, and his life energy was extracted by it to the point that he became like a dried-up mummy.</p>

  <p>"It's really quite troublesome to deal with these traitors.</p>

  <p>All of them want to rebel. Don't they know that I have a lot of things on my plate too?</p>

  <p>By the way, before dealing with the downgrader, I won't do anything to your primitive land. So, I hope you'd do the same to the Source World."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Zheng immediately knew that it was the real Evil God speaking.</p>

  <p>Before Zheng could even say anything, the dried-up body of the Evil God's avatar continued to shrink as cracks appeared all over his skin. Then, he was reduced to ashes that scattered throughout the void. At the same time, the enormous black spear also vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>As Zheng returned to his primitive land, he told everyone what had happened and what he learned.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the people on the jadeite platform were all shocked.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious? You mean to say that someone was able to comprehend the power of the Deep Space?" Even Kincaid had a strong expression of disbelief.</p>

  <p>"The aura of the power he displayed was very familiar. It was similar to the energy that was being exhibited by that heavy sword. It was also too powerful that I wasn't able to resist," Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>"But there might be another explanation. Maybe it was some kind of blended bloodline?" Kincaid tried to argue.</p>

  <p>"But he has the complete abilities of the ancestry-level bloodline," Zheng added. "He could dissolve and counter any power of the ancestry-level bloodline that I used."</p>

  <p>"How could that happen? Why could he obtain so many bloodline powers?"</p>

  <p>"That's inconceivable. He doesn't even have the ancestry-level bloodline."</p>

  <p>"That's right. He only relies on the Ways-blending Energy."</p>

  <p>Fuxi and the Snake Goddess also shared their sentiments and perplexity.</p>

  <p>However, something caught Kincaid's attention. When he heard them say that the Evil God was using the Ways-blending Energy, he immediately asked, "Did he fuse all the Godly Ways by himself?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He boasts an extraordinary talent in that area." Right after Zheng answered Kincaid's question, his expression suddenly changed as if he began to realize why Kincaid asked about it. His eyes kind of widened as he said, "We know that the lower-grade worlds can't be transformed into higher-grade ones. But can the energy and power from lower-grade worlds be restored to those of the higher-grade worlds?"</p>

  <p>According to what Zheng previously knew, the three thousand Godly Ways were actually the downgraded version of the ancestry-level bloodline's power.</p>

  <p>Only Zheng was able to possess the ancestry-level bloodline. Even the Evil God didn't have any means to obtain it. Therefore, the only viable explanation was that he was able to restore the Godly Ways to their higher-level version, granting him the power equal to that of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"I actually don't want to believe it. The Bold Conjecture House tried to do that thing but always failed. What kept them trying was only the assumption that it was possible to achieve," Kincaid sighed as he let out a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>At that time, the Bold Conjecture House had put a lot of energy, effort, and resources in this respect. They knew that once they succeeded with this, its impact would be so devastating and world-changing. However, they were stuck in a dead end, so they had no choice but to give up.</p>

  <p>Now, if a creature in the chaos was really able to restore the Godly Ways smoothly, not only Kincaid, but all the elders in the Bold Conjecture House that dedicated their lives in this matter would feel depressed.</p>

  <p>"Although the Evil God doesn't intend to attack us now, sooner or later, a battle would be inevitable. The worst part is that we're at an extreme disadvantage because both the Evil God and the downgrader have the power of the Deep Space," the Snake Goddess said in a dejected voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, we still have Geoffrey. We can only place our hopes on him," Zheng said with a faint smile, trying to somehow alleviate the mood of his companions.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on one side of the jadeite platform, Tianming was silently sitting.</p>

  <p>After Geoffrey set out, Tianming was sent to the jadeite platform so he could immediately report if anything happened to the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had been away for quite a period of time already. However, there had been no news so far. Everyone's anxiety was just deepening with each passing day.</p>

  <p>Some of them had started to lose hope that Geoffrey would still return.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, Tianming's shoulder suddenly trembled. Upon noticing this, he quickly stood and announced, "The other end of the Lone Sword seems to have trembled!"</p>

  <p>The eyes of the people instantly lit up as they heard this. They had been waiting for this news the entire time. With that, Kincaid and the others immediately gathered around Tianming.</p>
