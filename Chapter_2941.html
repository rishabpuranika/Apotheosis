  <p>
</p>

  <p>Lorena nodded. With a flick of her finger, she took the Reincarnation Soul Weapon in her hand.</p>

  <p>Her eyes closed and her eyelashes trembled as her consciousness began to roam the sea of Memory Flames.</p>

  <p>With the ability of the Reincarnation Soul Weapon, she was able to find Pascal's Memory Flame pretty quickly.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A Memory Flame, faint orange in color, drifted over the Reincarnation Soul Weapon.</p>

  <p>Liusu and Aleyna stared nervously at the Memory Flame.</p>

  <p>There was an old saying that the elder brother is like the father. Samuel had died, but it was nobody's fault but his own.</p>

  <p>They needed support and though Joy could be that for them, she was not as close to them as Pascal was.</p>

  <p>The Memory Flame floated towards Pascal's mind.</p>

  <p>A long time later, Pascal slowly opened his eyes and looked at the people around him, confused.</p>

  <p>"Liusu, what happened to me?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he felt the tips of his fingers tingling strangely. A surge of power emerged from the ring on his finger. His eyes widened at the strength of this power. This ring made him feel the existence of the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>"What's this ring? What happened?" Pascal said, panicking. He couldn't help but want to throw the ring away from him.</p>

  <p>Many things had happened after Pascal's Memory Flame was removed; it was a long story. Liusu sighed and said, "Come here, brother. I'll tell you."</p>

  <p>After Pascal and his sisters left, Iris burst out with the question she had kept down all this while, "Zheng, how is Tianming now?"</p>

  <p>Iris knew that the Mountain of Holy Beings was not closed and the competition to become Holy Beings was still going on.</p>

  <p>What was more, Harold had told her that there was a high probability of Tianming becoming a Holy Being, and that she should not be worried about him.</p>

  <p>But Iris could only imagine how fierce the competition would be and couldn't help but ask what was going on with Tianming at the moment.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked guilty at this question.</p>

  <p>Iris's heart tightened at his expression and she pressed on before Zheng could say anything, "What happened to him?"</p>

  <p>"Tianming died in the Mountain of Holy Beings," Zheng said gently.</p>

  <p>Mike's expression turned serious. Tianming and Sword Chen were both from the Evolutionary Universe, and Mike had the ability to gauge their situation in an instant if he wanted to. So when Mike was trapped in the Slaughtering Moonlight Array outside the divine land, he had known that Tianming had died.</p>

  <p>But Mike didn't know the details and had planned to ask Zheng in detail later.</p>

  <p>Iris, however, concerned for Tianming, had stepped forward and unwittingly asked the question.</p>

  <p>Iris's ruddy face paled, her eyes filling with tears. Her lips trembled as she fought to speak.</p>

  <p>Over the years, she'd be extremely worried every time Tianming left her. But he had never let her down. With good luck, he had always returned safely, even when he had gone to the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>But this time, her worries had finally come about.</p>

  <p>As he saw Iris's sad face, Zheng hurriedly said, "He died but we have his Memory Flame. We can reincarnate him in the divine land. With his talent, he can cultivate to become a top-rank True God in fifty years at most!"</p>

  <p>Iris was stunned. There had been a deep sadness on her face just moments ago, but she now saw a glimmer of hope. "Tianming can be reincarnated?"</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded firmly. "My mother is in charge of the Reincarnation Land in the divine land. She can locate Tianming's body after his reincarnation, and can also get his memory back to him."</p>

  <p>A matter of decades was short for a True God, which meant Iris could afford to wait.</p>

  <p>"But I think Tianming's Memory Flame only contains his memory in the divine land. I'm not sure about the memory he had in the Evolutionary Universe." Zheng turned to Mike as he spoke. "I wonder if Father can extract it from the universe."</p>

  <p>All memories of a warrior in the divine land were stored in the Reincarnation Land. But the universe couldn't in any way compare to the divine land, which was why Zheng was not sure about how memory worked in the universe and decided to ask Mike about it.</p>

  <p>Mike thought for a moment before saying, "I still can't extract the memories of every living creature in the Evolutionary Universe. But if it were Tianming's memory alone, I think I can do it."</p>

  <p>Zheng let out a sigh of relief at his father's answer.</p>

  <p>Tianming might have to start over to regain his cultivation, but he would be a divine citizen the moment he was reborn in the divine land. Moreover, with his memory that had been preserved, it would be easier for him to cultivate, especially since there were so many people who could help him. The situation was much better than he had expected.</p>

  <p>Three days later, the Mountain of Holy Beings on the north bank of the Time Sea suddenly began to tremble. dozens of Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods emerged from the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>These Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods looked a mix of dejected, regretful, and disappointed. The remaining three holy springs were occupied by the Leng Clan, Xie Clan, and the Bai Clan respectively.</p>

  <p>Though they were disappointed, they were also relieved that they hadn't died.</p>

  <p>As long as they were alive, there was still hope that they could become Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>But for those Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods who had died here, there was obviously no hope at all.</p>

  <p>As the Mountain of Holy Beings shook, it began to sink slowly into the underground.</p>

  <p>And as it sank, a huge crater appeared in the ground. The sea water belonging to the Time Sea poured in from the other end of the crater.</p>

  <p>In the countless years that the divine land had been in existence, the Mountain of Holy Beings had been enveloped by the sea water of the Time Sea, suppressing the divine land's original will. Although now its original will had been taken away, the Mountain of Holy Beings still had to continue bestowing the title of Holy Being.</p>

  <p>After the Mountain of Holy Beings returned to its original place, a few rays of light burst from the sky above the divine land.</p>

  <p>The rays of light headed straight towards the Hall of Holy Beings and it was not long before five figures appeared in the Hall of Holy Beings. The two people in the lead were Leland and Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>When their inner worlds became Rebirth Lands, they could obtain some extra power from the divine land.</p>

  <p>They were still just consummate True Gods in the eyes of the powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm. But they had a strength that was much more powerful than that of consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>These five people looked joyful because from then on, they could be considered top-level warriors in the divine land.</p>

  <p>The new Holy Being of the Leng Clan, Cade Leng, beamed with joy. Now that he had become a Holy Being, he was on an equal footing with Jeremiah, the Holy Emperor of the Leng Clan.</p>

  <p>It was now that a figure appeared quietly in the Hall of Holy Beings. It was none other than Zheng.</p>

  <p>Mike, Holy Jay, Lorena and others followed him into the Hall.</p>

  <p>"Master!"</p>

  <p>Sword Chen respectfully saluted Mike even though he had become a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Cade Leng and the other Holy Beings glanced at Zheng coldly.</p>

  <p>Zheng had suppressed almost everyone on his own in the Mountain of Holy Beings. But truth was that he was still only a True God.</p>

  <p>They were fearful of Zheng's strength but they still thought they were at a level higher than Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, didn't even look at them. He walked onto the platform of the Hall of Holy Beings and said calmly, "Holy Beings! Please come together. Some rules need to be revised."</p>
