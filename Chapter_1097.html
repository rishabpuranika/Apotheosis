  <p>
</p>

  <p>The only excuse that the audience could think of to explain what was currently happening before their eyes was that War Emperor York had unexpectedly shown immense mercy to Luo Luo Zheng. He couldn't have gone all out to attack Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After the Soul Sea was created by martial artists, they created a world within their body in order to make it easier for them to cultivate their souls.</p>

  <p>The resources of the Lower World were scarce. It was completely incomparable to what the Upper World had. In the Lower World, the means for martial artists to cultivate their souls weren't that many.</p>

  <p>In the Upper World, many talented martial artists could cultivate their souls and make their souls enter the Fighting Soul Realm while they were at the Virtual Tribulation Realm or Life and Death Realm. In the Lower World, however, many martial artists could only cultivate their souls and make their souls reach the Fighting Soul Realm after they had created the Soul Sea and had reached the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was a shining exception to this.</p>

  <p>From a certain point of view, however, this was not totally unexpected.</p>

  <p>First of all, Luo Luo Zheng did not cultivate his soul in the Lower World. He had actually relied on the Dragon Soar Arena to ascend to the Genuine Dragon World. It was in that place that he had gone through the Owl Beast devil spirit's test, and that made it possible for his soul to improve rapidly. Moreover, he was able to absorb a significant amount of soul force and that helped his soul to reach the Fighting Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>In the Lower World, the most powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm would easily suppress all the Life and Death Realm warriors. The gap between their level of soul was vastly enormous.</p>

  <p>Only after reaching the Fighting Soul Realm could one's soul be transformed into a powerful weapon.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York stared at Luo Luo Zheng in utter confusion. He could feel Luo Zheng's powerful soul which was in no way weaker than his own. In fact, it seemed like it was even stronger!</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng staged a counterattack, War Emperor York would inevitably suffer. At the very least, the wisp of his soul that he used to attack Luo Luo Zheng with would likely be exterminated.</p>

  <p>Moments passed and it became clear that Luo Luo Zheng would not counterattack.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York thought that he was probably wary of his overall strength.</p>

  <p>War Emperor York stared at Luo Luo Zheng blankly for a while before saying,</p>

  <p>"Good, good, good job! At such a young age and with such a low cultivation level, you actually possess a soul close to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm! Such a young hero, you are!"</p>

  <p>The moment the people around heard what War Emperor York said, their faces became contorted with expressions of utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>They all originally thought that War Emperor York had held back his strength, but with his pronouncement, he had indirectly confirmed that wasn't the case -- it was just that Luo Zheng's soul had almost reached the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm!</p>

  <p>Even for warriors at Soul Sea Realm, it would be extremely difficult for their soul to enter the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm. It was all the more impossible for such thing to happen in the Lower World!</p>

  <p>In the Lower World, the available number of refinement techniques and pills used to cultivate one's soul was simply too small. Then, even if someone got a hold of them, their effects were usually very poor.</p>

  <p>Another thing was, since the ancient times, there had never been a Life and Death Realm warrior that had cultivated his soul to reach the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm. Luo Luo Zheng was just a warrior at Virtual Tribulation Realm? how was he able to achieve that? Furthermore, he was only at the middle stage of the Virtual Tribulation Realm!</p>

  <p>These played inside everyone's head as their stares bounced off from War Emperor York to Luo Luo Zheng, their mouths wide open.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Marine, the Holy Maiden immediately said,</p>

  <p>"Yes! Master Wallace has mentioned before that the Spirit Container he arranged in the Sky Northern Region was destroyed by  Luo Luo Zheng Luo. This person's soul force is so strong. We don't need Elder Gong to come to have a look. You are definitely  Luo Luo Zheng Luo!"</p>

  <p>"No matter who this kid is, how did he cultivate his soul to such a level that even War Emperor York was helpless against him?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't this all too shocking? Furthermore, he came from a small place like the Sky Northern Region. It has been said since ancient times that if a Life and Death Realm warrior enters the Sky Northern Region, he can flatten the entire region and kill all the living beings there."</p>

  <p>"This is impossible! How could such a talent come from such a place like the Sky Northern Region?"</p>

  <p>The Virtual Tribulation Realm warriors who could stand beside the West Dragon River were basically the divine-level talents of the four divine kingdoms. Moreover, they were talents of the first tier and the second tier. There were rarely any third tier warriors among them.</p>

  <p>These divine-level talents even had a high possibility of stepping into the Soul Sea Realm in the future! But then, in the end, that was just a possibility. There still weren't many warriors who had been able to reach the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Despite this, nothing had stopped them from being conceited. After all, they were the best warriors in the four divine kingdoms!</p>

  <p>But at this moment, nothing could stop them from being shocked. Luo Zheng's glaringly formidable strength wasn't the main source of their surprise, however. After all, there were many ways to gauge a martial artist's strength: cultivation method, strength, speed, cultivation level, and soul?</p>

  <p>The soul was just one aspect.</p>

  <p>Just like what War Emperor York had said, Luo Zheng's soul was indeed strong, like it was close to the Jasper Fighting Soul Realm, incomparable to all of theirs. However, this did not mean that Luo Zheng's all other aspects were very strong. After all, he had not shown his real strength yet.</p>
