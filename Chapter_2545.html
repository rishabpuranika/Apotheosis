  <p>
</p>

  <p>"What? We can get as many Admission Tokens as we want?" Zheng asked in shock.</p>

  <p>He spent 5, 000 wild bones in order to get his Admission Token, but it seemed he could have as many as he wanted for free here!</p>

  <p>"The rule was revised last month though Admission Tokens were already very cheap before then," a woman with a ponytail informed him.</p>

  <p>The Immemorial Wilderness beneath the Sky South Bone Tower was very prosperous.</p>

  <p>Outlaws would willingly go inside, risking their necks just to collect wild bones. If they were able to come back alive, they were certain to have a great deal of wild bones with them.</p>

  <p>After handing over a certain amount to the Nine Li race, they would still have a lot left for themselves.</p>

  <p>Only with enough wild bones could one make rapid progress with their cultivation base.</p>

  <p>However, things changed ever since the violent fight that transpired between the Nine Li race and the Yellow Emperor race. The Immemorial Wilderness had gotten more dangerous. Bringing wild bones back had become a matter of life and death.</p>

  <p>The risk was high and the outlaws knew they had to prepare themselves for death once they got their Admission Tokens. Over time, fewer and fewer people entered the Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>Prices for Admission Tokens dropped and dropped until they were declared free-for-all.</p>

  <p>Opportunistic merchants took advantage of this. Warriors in remote cities were not necessarily aware of the Admission Tokens' loss in value and bought them from exploitative merchants at a high price.</p>

  <p>Sand Core City was one of these remote cities, and it was in an auction house that Zheng found and bought his Admission Token.</p>

  <p>It was only then that he realized how much he wasted to buy this worthless Admission Token.</p>

  <p>However, he shook this off.</p>

  <p>He had more important things to do than worry about 3, 000 wild bones.</p>

  <p>"With your cultivation base, the chances of you surviving are pretty slim.</p>

  <p>It's not too late to back out," the woman said.</p>

  <p>Not even the real outlaws dared to bet their lives in this Immemorial Wilderness.</p>

  <p>The only ones who entered that place were either indifferent to the value of their lives or extremely confident of their powers.</p>

  <p>A newbie like Zheng was extremely rare.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your thoughts," he told her. "I've chosen to go to the Immemorial Wilderness and am more than prepared for it mentally."</p>

  <p>Seeing the calm and determination on Zheng's face, the woman didn't say anything else.</p>

  <p>While they waited, a few Wild Gods had rushed in and appeared in front of the building.</p>

  <p>Some of these Wild Gods were surprised at Zheng's presence, but most of them looked indifferent. Zheng's cultivation base had nothing to do with them.</p>

  <p>An hour later, Zheng heard a muffled sound from the door.</p>

  <p>The door opened and a woman wearing an emerald robe emerged. She looked around with a cold look in her eyes. "Everyone, please take out your Admission Token for registration. Anyone who doesn't have one can receive it for free," she said.</p>

  <p>After speaking, she quickly turned back and went back to where she came.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods all stepped forward and entered the building.</p>

  <p>The pony-tailed woman also followed, but stayed back at the last second.</p>

  <p>She turned to look back and found Zheng staring at the doorway with a blank look on his face. She smiled, thinking he was having second thoughts and now wasn't willing to go in. "If you're not prepared, it's better to go back. This is no place for children."</p>

  <p>She knew he had just started cultivating the Wild God system and was most probably only fifty to sixty feet tall when he activated it. Zheng was a mere child in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Her words wounded Zheng's pride a little bit. "Is that woman wearing an emerald robe a member of the Nine Li race?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nine Li race?" His question stunned her momentarily. She quickly shook her head. "No, she's a mere steward of the Nine Li race's affiliated sect."</p>

  <p>The Nine Li race was considered one of the top forces in the world and there were numerous sects attached to it.</p>

  <p>No member of the Nine Li race should deal with such trivial matters as registration. That was what the stewards were for.</p>

  <p>"A steward of an affiliated sect?" Zheng murmured in disappointment.</p>

  <p>"After registering your name, the Nine Li people will take you into the Immemorial Wilderness," she told him before going into the building without a second backward glance.</p>

  <p>There was no ounce of hesitation in Zheng's body. He also followed suit and went into the building.</p>

  <p>Inside were hundreds of Wild Gods, gathered together for registration.</p>

  <p>"I know most of you here are already experienced, but I will still have to tell you the rules. No hiding the wild bones you've collected. You must give us half of your haul. Anyone who dares disobey will be killed!" the steward announced.</p>

  <p>'So I'll have to give up half the wild bones I collect, ' Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>After all, the Admission Tokens were not given to them really for free.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, what would the point be of this race occupying this part of the Immemorial Wilderness?</p>

  <p>"If you encounter anyone from the Yellow Emperor race, try your best to kill them!" she added.</p>

  <p>This part of the Immemorial Wilderness might be a place of adventure, but to these Wild Gods, it was a battleground.</p>

  <p>It was where the members of the Yellow Emperor race and the Nine Li race clashed and eliminated as many of their opponents as possible.</p>

  <p>The Wild Gods with noble blood lineage were much stronger than ordinary Wild Gods. It was much harder to kill them.</p>

  <p>From time to time, Wild Gods with noble blood lineage would be able to slaughter a group of ordinary Wild Gods.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why this place was so dangerous.</p>

  <p>The steward said a few more things before she began to group them.</p>

  <p>Four people were grouped, forming a temporary team that went in together.</p>

  <p>She called out the names one by one and those that were clustered together began evaluating the strength of their teammates.</p>

  <p>Everyone hoped for capable allies, and none of them wanted to carry a burden with them.</p>

  <p>"Amos, Hiram, Sarah and, Zheng, you four make a team," the woman announced.</p>

  <p>The scarred man, the pony-tailed woman, and another burly man stepped forward.</p>

  <p>The three of them looked around to find out the identity of their last teammate. It was then that Zheng finally walked out.</p>

  <p>The scarred man's expression changed. He didn't expect to be teamed up with the newbie.</p>

  <p>He turned to the steward. "I don't want to be teamed-up with this guy.</p>

  <p>Can I be reassigned?"</p>

  <p>The other Wild Gods thought the same thing and even cast a few pitiful looks at Zheng's teammates.</p>

  <p>The steward merely gave the scarred man a cold smile. "Amos, this isn't your first time here. Do you not know the rules? You can't change teammates, not even if they're good for nothing!"</p>
