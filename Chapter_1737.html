<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As world lords, Finch and the two elders behind him knew the rules and restraints better than Zheng.</p>

  <p>A Supreme Lord had become a True God?</p>

  <p>Such thing had never ever happened before.</p>

  <p>This was why it was hard for them to believe that it was possible.</p>

  <p>World lords could become True Gods. Though the chance was very small, there was a few possibilities.</p>

  <p>However, after a Supreme Lord bore the Heavenly Destiny, this possibility would be eliminated because they would never cross the current round of heavens.</p>

  <p>However, this time everyone in the universe had already seen how Shania crossed the restraints of the heavens easily.</p>

  <p>The rules and restraints might be rigid, but people were flexible.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was a talent from the Sword Manor, and he might be able to break these rules.</p>

  <p>Zheng himself could not figure it out.</p>

  <p>He knew that Sword Chen had become a True God only because he had seen Sword Chen have a position in the Corridor of Emperor.</p>

  <p>Maybe the key was in the Emotion Closing Godly Way cultivated by Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>"I wonder where you got the news from. Have you met Supreme Lord Sword before?" Finch asked.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded and said, "That's right. The reason I came to the Sword Manor is because I have talked to him once. And I want to continue to cultivate my sword intent here."</p>

  <p>Seeing the world lords still had some doubts, he raised his arm to prove the truth of his words.</p>

  <p>A bright-blue light emitted from a sword-shaped mark on the upper part of his arm.</p>

  <p>This sword-shaped mark was inscribed into Zheng's arm by Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>Finch did not speak. The two elders behind him suddenly cried,</p>

  <p>"Whispering Sword!"</p>

  <p>"How on earth did you get that?"</p>

  <p>Though these two elders had lived for many years, as world lords, they didn't have the demeanor that the world lords usually had.</p>

  <p>When Zheng stood up, Freya followed him. She found the world lords' shocked faces funny.</p>

  <p>The world lords were the ones who controlled one supreme world each.</p>

  <p>How could they be so uncool?</p>

  <p>It had not been too long since Freya ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>Moreover, she spent most of her time in the fairy palace, so naturally she didn't know that these three people who had taken charge of the Sword Manor were not ordinary people, especially Finch, the head of the Sword Manor. Not only was he considered to be very strong among the world lords, but he could also be compared to the grand world lords of the great forces.</p>

  <p>If he wasn't here, it would be hard for the Sword Manor to manage such a situation without Supreme Lord Sword. Freya was also wondering what the Whispering Sword was.</p>

  <p>Zheng was also puzzled. He looked at the three world lords, hoping that they would give him an answer.</p>

  <p>He originally thought that the sword-shaped mark was just a token of Supreme Lord Sword. Seeing the reaction of the three people around him, he realized that this definitely was not an ordinary mark. If that was the case, why did Sword Chen give him the mark?</p>

  <p>The two elders fell silent as they regarded Zheng with an odd look.</p>

  <p>Even Finch, the most poised one, frowned slightly as he looked Zheng up and down. Zheng felt nervous under his sharp gaze.</p>

  <p>"Whispering Sword? What's that?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>However, Finch did not reply, instead he just stared at him. After a long while, he sighed deeply and said, "Zheng, if you don't mind, please stay in my Sword Manor tonight. I can only answer this question tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Zheng was puzzled, but since Finch was the owner of the Sword Manor, and he was a guest, he had no option but to be patient and wait.</p>

  <p>After arranging the rooms for Zheng and Freya, Finch and the two elders went to the Sword Heart Pavilion in the Sword Manor. Finch took out a jade sword and tossed it upwards. The jade sword pierced through the ceiling of the Sword Heart Pavilion and flew high in the air. It turned into hundreds of green sword shadows and exploded all around.</p>

  <p>In the late hours of the night, the explosion looked like dazzling fireworks.</p>

  <p>After the sword shadows exploded, people in the Sword Manor flew toward the Sword Heart Pavilion on their swords.</p>

  <p>The people who ignored the no-fly ban of the Sword Manor enjoyed a high status in the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>"Sir!"</p>

  <p>"Master Bi!"</p>

  <p>"Why have you summoned us at this late hour?"</p>

  <p>The warriors who were summoned there were all sword cultivators and their cultivation ranged from the late stage of the Spirit Transformation Realm to the level that was a half-step away from a world lord. They were the elders in the Sword House of the Sword Manor. They were also the backbone of the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>Since Finch had suddenly sent for them in the middle of the night, the elders who had arrived there in haste thought that something important might have happened. They inquired reason anxiously, however, Finch just shook his head and didn't say a word.</p>

  <p>Once all twenty-seven elders in the Sword House arrived, Finch spoke,</p>

  <p>"I call upon you all at this hour because I have to discuss an important thing with you."</p>

  <p>A look of worry appeared on the elders' faces. Hearing Finch's serious voice, they couldn't help but wonder whether the crisis of the universe broke out earlier than they expected and if the spot was their very own Sword Manor? If so, that would be terrible news.</p>

  <p>"The Whispering Sword has appeared," Finch said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>The elders were stunned.</p>

  <p>"That's impossible!"</p>

  <p>"The Supreme Lord had died so many years ago. If he had left the Whispering Sword behind, it would have appeared long ago. How can it appear suddenly now?"</p>

  <p>"You're right. If someone had got their hands on the Whispering Sword, they would have showed up earlier! We won't allow anyone to control the Sword Manor just because the Whispering Sword is in their possession! Master Bi is our one and only leader!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was speaking excitedly and soon there was a din in the Sword Heart Pavilion.</p>

  <p>Finch waved his hand to them to signal for silence, and the commotion immediately died down in the Sword Heart Pavilion. He then announced the other news, "Supreme Lord Sword... is not dead."</p>

  <p>"We are aware that he is not dead and he is just missing, but we also know that this is just our official statement," someone said in confusion.</p>

  <p>They were all puzzled as to why Finch was announcing something that they already knew.</p>

  <p>Finch explained, "He is not dead nor is he missing. He has become a True God and has moved to the divine land."</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"How is that possible?"</p>

  <p>"Master Bi, are you feeling unwell?</p>

  <p>You must be very tired."</p>

  <p>The elders' reaction was much more exaggerated than that of Finch and the two elders. This news erased everything they knew about Supreme Lord Sword.</p>

  <p>Finch continued, "Actually, I haven't personally seen our old master. I found out about this from Zheng."</p>

  <p>"Zheng? The top warrior of the Illusion Battlefield?"</p>

  <p>"The one who won the chance to lead the world of chaos several days ago? What has he come to the Sword Manor for?"</p>

  <p>"I heard that he is trapped in the Middle Sky Region, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>It became noisy once again in the Sword Heart Pavilion. The elders were usually calm and composed, but this time, because of the shocking news, they became very agitated.</p>

  <p>Finch commanded them to calm down again, "Everyone, be quiet." He continued, "I don't know whether what Zheng said is true or not. After all, there is no evidence. But I am certain about one thing. I and the two elders did see Supreme Lord Sword's Whispering Sword on Zheng's arm."</p>

  <p>His words had the desired effect and everyone fell silent again. Nobody knew what to say anymore.</p>

  <p>The Whispering Sword was the most notable heritage of the Sword Manor.</p>

  <p>According to the rule established by Supreme Lord Sword back then, if he died, the next master of the Sword Manor must acquire the Whispering Sword to open the gate of the Killing Sword Mountain. Only in this way could one officially inherit the Sword Manor and become the new master.</p>

  <p>Finch didn't have the Whispering Sword. He was just the acting leader.</p>

  <p>The Whispering Sword hadn't appeared for so many years. Nobody worried about it and had gradually forgot about it. No one questioned Finch as their leader.</p>

  <p>After all Finch had made so many significant contributions to the development of the Sword Manor all these years.</p>

  <p>Now someone had suddenly showed up with the Whispering Sword.</p>

  <p>Everyone felt a rush of emotions at this scene.</p>

  <p>This was not the root of the problem.</p>

  <p>The biggest factor to consider was that the one who possessed the Whispering Sword was Zheng.</p>

  <p>If an unknown warrior had taken the Whispering Sword to the Sword Manor and expressed a desire to inherit the Sword Manor, the elders of the Sword House would have immediately chucked the warrior out, or even killed him.</p>

  <p>But this was no ordinary warrior; it was Zheng. So this was a different and slightly complex situation.</p>

  <p>The crisis of the world of chaos was approaching and no one could escape the imminent disaster.</p>

  <p>Warriors who had participated in the final battles at the Illusion Battlefield would take up the responsibility to help everyone go safely through this crisis of the universe.</p>

  <p>The crisis might come in ten years, or in a hundred years and for the warriors in the universe, there wasn't too much time to prepare for it.</p>

  <p>If the top warrior of the Illusion Battlefield became their new master, it would benefit them a lot. It was this conflict that had everyone tongue-tied.</p>
