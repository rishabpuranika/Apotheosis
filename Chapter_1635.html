<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Malachi, who had offered himself to the Saint Killing Spear, could be considered a puppet that only knew killings.</p>

  <p>As Zheng retreated, Malachi chased to kill him.</p>

  <p>But the city was protected by the rules of the heavens. Malachi, who was wielding the spear, was blocked outside the city walls, just like the small skulls.</p>

  <p>The only difference was that the skulls had been unable to pierce through the invisible barrier, while Malachi, who was controlled by the spear, could.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The blood-red light of the spear tore through the invisible barrier. He had actually drilled his way into the city.</p>

  <p>The strength of the body determined the power of the spear.</p>

  <p>For example, if Xun had sacrificed herself, she would have been able to display all of the spear's potential. The power she could unleash was breathtaking.</p>

  <p>Similarly, after Malachi had offered himself to the spear, his own strength had also soared.</p>

  <p>However, although he had broken through the invisible barrier, he was being held back by the rules of the heavens in the city.</p>

  <p>Zheng retreated rapidly just moments after he entered the city. The spear spun crazily, disobeying the rules of the heavens as it chased after Zheng.</p>

  <p>And right now, Zheng had no way to fight back since fighting was prohibited in the city.</p>

  <p>However, he had no intention of fighting with Malachi. Flying and fighting were prohibited within the city, so he could only retreat.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate for Zheng that under the suppression of the rules of the heavens, Malachi's speed wasn't great. Disobeying the rules required an extremely powerful force. Even though Malachi could resist the rules to a certain extent after being controlled by the spear, it became very difficult for him to move forward. And because of this, he wasn't that faster than Zheng.</p>

  <p>The other martial artists could only watch from the sidelines since they couldn't make a move anyway.</p>

  <p>On top of the city walls, Zheng was retreating all the way back, Malachi getting closer and closer to him. The spinning spear was less than a foot away from Zheng's nose.</p>

  <p>100 feet. 200 feet. 300 feet.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had run for 1, 000 feet, the spear point was less than two inches away from his face.</p>

  <p>But Malachi suddenly froze.</p>

  <p>Everyone watched the scene unfold before them in complete silence.</p>

  <p>They had never seen a fight in the city before.</p>

  <p>A whirring sound could be heard as a gentle breeze blew.</p>

  <p>Something akin to ash fell off Malachi's body.</p>

  <p>Soon, his entire body began to disintegrate and collapse into ash. The Saint Killing Spear fell to the ground with a clang.</p>

  <p>Malachi had previously relied on the spear to resist the rules to a certain degree.</p>

  <p>However, there was a time limit for the offering. The stronger one was, the longer the time limit would be.</p>

  <p>At his current cultivation level of the Soul Sea Realm, he could only be controlled by the spear for less than 150 seconds.</p>

  <p>When all of his vitality had been consumed by the spear and the spear began to wear away, the rules of the heavens formed an irresistible pressure that pressed down on his body, causing it to be crushed into fine powder.</p>

  <p>A red ray of light floated past Zheng.</p>

  <p>That was Malachi's soul. After his death, he returned to the city to be resurrected.</p>

  <p>Zheng's brow creased.</p>

  <p>"Why hasn't he left any Illusion Points?"</p>

  <p>Malachi was an ace talent. He had passed the Hall of Causality and had fought around this city for a long time. So the number of Illusion Points he had inside his body should have been astonishing. But no Illusion Points left his body, which puzzled Zheng.</p>

  <p>Malachi was ranked fourth in this supreme world and 88th in the Illusion Battlefield, which were higher than Zheng.</p>

  <p>But no Illusion Points emerged from his body after his death. Everyone looked around, confused.</p>

  <p>"What's going on? Why didn't the Illusion Points leave Malachi's body after his death?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't this cheating?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he has other methods that we don't know anything about."</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't the only one who was confused. The others couldn't figure out why either. Janet, Jeffrey, and some other warriors walked down from the city walls and surrounded Zheng.</p>

  <p>Hailey heaved a sigh of relief. Even though Zheng had to retreat in defeat, he had won in the end.</p>

  <p>It had been quite risky to fight against an ace talent, but the reward was incomparably generous. The winner would obtain a massive amount of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>A cold laugh rang out suddenly. Zheng looked around to find a martial artist walking up to him. "Since Malachi was willing to offer himself, he must have had a way out. You must feel it strange, right?"</p>

  <p>The speaker was one of Malachi's followers. When Zheng had killed five people with two sword strikes, the remaining three had retreated to the city. This man was one of them.</p>

  <p>As he walked, he glanced at the Saint Killing Spear on the ground.</p>

  <p>According to the rules, once a martial artist died in the Illusion Battlefield, his clothes, weapons, and space ring would reappear after he was resurrected.</p>

  <p>The strange thing was that the Saint Killing Spear didn't disappear. It just lay there on the ground.</p>

  <p>The martial artist obviously didn't want Zheng to have the spear. Since Zheng hadn't picked up the spear yet, he approached it as he spoke. And since fights were forbidden in the city, whoever took the spear first would be its owner.</p>

  <p>While Zheng was confused about why he didn't get any Illusion Points, he saw the martial artist walk over, so he blithely lifted the spear with his toes and tossed it into his space ring. Smiling faintly, he said to the martial artist, "I'm indeed confused. Can you tell me why?"</p>

  <p>The martial artist froze at Zheng's actions and cursed internally. He glared at Zheng before saying coldly, "Malachi has obtained three Exemption Medallions. And with these, he won't lose any Illusion Points at his death. Surprised? You have killed him once. You still won't get anything even if you kill him twice more. You'd better give me his weapon, or he will definitely not let you off!"</p>

  <p>The spectators came to a realization as they heard his explanation and turned green with envy.</p>

  <p>Malachi actually had three Exemption Medallions! This was too much!</p>

  <p>Zheng was relieved as he finally knew why, but he was still curious. He himself had obtained a Teleportation Token, so it would not be strange for Malachi to receive three Exemption Medallions. Malachi's follower tried to threaten Zheng, but Zheng just smiled and said, "Oh? He's not going to let me off? Can he defeat me without the Saint Killing Spear?"</p>

  <p>Regardless of what Malachi was capable of, he had already become cowardly and had lost heart before Zheng. Now that Zheng had taken his spear away, he didn't have the courage to confront Zheng head on.</p>

  <p>Malachi was soon revived at the main city and rushed over to Zheng. The moment he saw Zheng, his face darkened as he asked, "Where is my weapon?"</p>

  <p>After he had offered himself, his consciousness had been sealed, so he didn't know what had happened until the moment of his death. Now that he saw Zheng standing there unscathed, his spear missing, he flew into a rage.</p>

  <p>"He has taken away your weapon!" the martial artist said to Malachi.</p>

  <p>Malachi's eyes flashed with anger. "Give it back to me!" he shouted, stretching out a hand.</p>

  <p>"The Saint Killing Spear isn't your weapon in the first place. Why should I give it back to you?" Zheng said, smiling.</p>

  <p>Now that he had the Saint Killing Spear, Zheng had already made plans.</p>

  <p>Should he spend five million Illusion Points making a trip through the Hall of Causality?</p>

  <p>If he had enough time, he really wanted to give Xun a surprise.</p>

  <p>Malachi stared at Zheng for a moment before saying, "I didn't expect  Zheng Luo, whose name is renowned throughout the universe, to be such a coward. You didn't dare to fight me head on and even fled to the main city with your tail between your legs. I almost killed you even though you were protected by the laws of the heavens."</p>

  <p>Since they were not allowed to fight in the city, Malachi could only try to provoke Zheng with words.</p>

  <p>"We can fight after we leave the city," Zheng said calmly.</p>

  <p>"Give me back the spear, and we'll fight again," Malachi said.</p>

  <p>Zheng smiled mockingly at Malachi. "I won't return the spear," he said.</p>

  <p>"Then forget it. There's nothing you can do about me in the main city!"</p>

  <p>Malachi said coldly.</p>

  <p>His battle with Zheng might not have been that big of a deal. Although Zheng had taken away his spear, he should still be able to safely move on to the next stage now that he was ranked fourth in this supreme world.</p>

  <p>The Saint Killing Spear was just a projection. It didn't matter if he lost it, but he would have to use his own weapon in the next stage.</p>

  <p>His gaze swept around and landed on Hailey, "You bitch! Come here!"</p>
