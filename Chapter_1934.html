<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Despite being omniscient in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Holy Jay could not do anything to help the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>While he was a good friend of Mike, he was incapable of fighting those from the Hall of Holy Beings. Besides, he couldn't help Mike directly because he couldn't disobey the rules of the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Thus, he could only partake in the nurturing of the ten Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was one of the most important ones among them, so Holy Jay generously shared his strength source with him.</p>

  <p>However, such a thing was unimaginable for other Holy Beings. They wouldn't go so far as to share their own strength source with others.</p>

  <p id="top_3">When one had reached the Holy Realm, strength wasn't the only factor that determined the champion. Still, there were still many specific situations where strength played an important role.</p>

  <p>Under such circumstances, it was pertinent that Holy Jay wisely made use of their limited time.</p>

  <p>He was responsible for the training of all those ten Godly Geniuses, not just Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>All the other Godly Geniuses including Mu Ning, Lucille, and Karl had their own missions. However, the resources allotted for them were naturally not as many as Luo Zheng's and Tianming's.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay had never been to the Evolutionary Universe before, so he didn't really understand what exactly was going on there. Right now, all he knew was that Murphy had made his move, and made the creatures within his inner world begin to take over the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Being the ever perceptive person that Luo Luo Zheng was, he asked Holy Jay why he didn't try to deduce the fate of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay said that he was unable to calculate it himself.</p>

  <p>Actually, the methods of divining destiny only existed in the universes.</p>

  <p>Thus, even a Holy Being wouldn't be able to predict the fate of others in the divine land.</p>

  <p>A thoughtful look filled Luo Zheng's eyes. He remembered that more than a year ago, Tianming had told him that the so-called destiny was fake. His exact words had implied something similar.</p>

  <p>The so-called destiny was merely a path that had been laid out in the heavens for quite a long time. In fact, the divination techniques that were used in the universe were produced by those who thought they had seen through the heavens.</p>

  <p>It was because the master of a universe had the ability to arrange everything. They could make any living being in the universe and even any piece of matter move according to their will.</p>

  <p>For example, every step that Luo Luo Zheng took was arranged by Mike.</p>

  <p>However, the divine land was different. Things like a controller or even the heavens did not exist there. It was a world that was freely constructed, and everything within the said world was in a random state.</p>

  <p>Legends said that a great divination technique existed in some lost Divine Dao. Not only could it tamper with one's fate, it could also predict the fates of all the living beings in the divine land. Yet up until now, no one had ever comprehended this kind of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Although Holy Jay couldn't deduce the fate of the universe, he estimated they had three years to get prepared, after he heard the information given by Luo Luo Zheng and Tianming and measured the power of the fake Sacred race created in Murphy Universe.</p>

  <p>He even measured the power of the Demon Night. After all, Holy Jay knew about the intentions of the Demon Night from Xun, Luo Zheng's sword spirit.</p>

  <p>"Three years is indeed short, but I will occasionally compress the time, to make it enough for you to cultivate," Holy Jay said with a grim smile on his worried face. It was hard to imagine that the supreme existence of the divine land would ever look like that. "Next, you will have to bring the two girls from Han Clan to Soul Suppressing Cliff. You must seize the opportunity to develop the relationship with them," he added.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng could only mentally roll his eyes--he believed that this Holy Jay had led a dissolute life in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't try to woo Han Liusu, as it wasn't in accordance with his nature. In other words, he couldn't do such a thing due to his character, but he still did as Holy Jay said. After all, he had obtained a black trial tally so he could cultivate at the Soul Suppressing Cliff.</p>

  <p>Foreign warriors and divine land warriors alike viewed the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land as a place where both opportunities and dangers coexisted.</p>

  <p>However, the ten Godly Geniuses of the Celestial Position suddenly found that the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land seemed to be kinder after a year of training. Their every move went unusually smooth, and they felt a strangeness which caused everyone to be on guard.</p>

  <p>Only three out of the ten Godly Geniuses knew about Holy Jay's existence. They were Luo Luo Zheng, Tianming, and Xenia. The rest of them remained oblivious to it.</p>

  <p>Apparently Holy Jay had arranged for everything. In fact, moderate training was more beneficial to these people, because there was a huge and immense difference between the strengths of warriors who were forcefully trained and those who had a lot of experience. However, everything was because of one reason? there wasn't much time left.</p>

  <p>Han Liusu and her companions were trapped by Holy Jay in the cave and had some thoughts about it. However, Luo Luo Zheng did not give a positive answer.</p>

  <p>After all, Holy Jay did not want the news of him interfering to be spread to the divine land, so he naturally left the matter at that.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had arrived at the Soul Suppressing Cliff, he realized that Holy Jay had sealed his supreme comprehension of some Divine Dao in the place. So far, only a few people had been there.</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Luo Luo Zheng didn't find any records about the Emotion Closing Divine Dao. After some thoughtful consideration, he finally chose the most mature Wishing Spell.</p>

  <p>However, Han Liusu disapproved of Luo Zheng's decision. In her opinion, the great Wishing Spell wasn't a rare Divine Dao in the divine land. Almost everyone knew how to do it.</p>

  <p>In reality, she was so obsessed with the Soul Suppressing Cliff because she knew that the internal momentum of "Soul Suppressing Technique" that Holy Jay had cultivated was hidden within the cliff.</p>

  <p>As its name implied, the Soul Suppressing Technique was a token to suppress one's soul. One would be able to suppress the souls of many experts after comprehending it. But of course, it would be extremely overbearing, and there were only a handful of True Gods in the divine land who had mastered the Soul Suppressing Technique to top level.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, only Holy Jay had mastered it to the Holy Realm.</p>

  <p>Therefore, observing the internal momentum of Holy Jay's Soul Suppressing Technique naturally benefitted a lot. But Luo Luo Zheng only practiced the great Wishing Spell when he had delved into the cliff, she couldn't help but feel a little pity.</p>

  <p>Still, Luo Luo Zheng didn't feel himself foolish. He had always thought that what suited him was the most important thing. Yet, there was a price to pay for the usage of the great Wishing Spell. If one was unable to make their wish come true, it would result to a handicap or even an injury.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had understood that he would be faced with more serious problems in the future. First, he would have to face the crisis of the Evolutionary Universe. Even after the said crisis had been resolved, he would still have to go to the divine land. Then, he would have to face more powerful existences, and even deal with Holy Beings there.</p>

  <p>With his current strength, Luo Luo Zheng wouldn't be able to fight against a True God, let alone a Holy Being. So if he wanted to win by even a small margin, he had to take the risk.</p>

  <p>While Han Liusu berated Luo Luo Zheng of wasting the opportunity, Aleyna was quite impressed by all his actions. It was simply because she was younger, and the way she thought about things was quite different from her sister.</p>

  <p>Those who had entered the Soul Suppressing Cliff included Luo Luo Zheng, Han Liusu, and also Aleyna, who was apparently also qualified to enter.</p>

  <p>Holy Jay put his heart and efforts into creating opportunity for Luo Luo Zheng to get along with two sisters from Han Clan. Although Luo Luo Zheng was aware of it, he still failed to live up to Holy Jay's intentions. Luo Luo Zheng couldn't simply disobey his heart to play up to the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Kennan and the other guards waited outside the Soul Suppressing Cliff. He and the rest first thought that they knew a lot about the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. While their own princess did say that Luo Luo Zheng would be able to bring her to the Soul Suppressing Cliff, they didn't believe so. It was beyond their imagination that Luo Luo Zheng did bring both sisters there so easily. Unfortunately for them, they could only wait outside in envy as Holy Jay wasn't so generous to allow them into the Soul Suppressing Cliff too.</p>

  <p>Half a year later when they had left the Soul Suppressing Cliff, the Han sisters did their best to invite Luo Luo Zheng to the divine land.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Luo Zheng quickly refused the two sisters' invitation almost without hesitation. After all, he was a secondary creature created by Mike. He couldn't enter the divine land at all with his current status. Besides, he would restore into a mass of life vitality if he forced his way in.</p>

  <p>What he didn't expect was for Aleyna to say that she could think of a solution, and for Han Liusu to show the same intention.</p>

  <p>A secondary creature was restored to life vitality upon entry in the divine land. It was the law and breaking the law had dire consequences, but there were still some who had broken it after countless divine eras had passed.</p>

  <p>Aleyna expressed that for such an outstanding person like Luo Luo Zheng, her royal father should be willing to help.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still firmly refused their invitation. He indeed would go to the divine land, but now was definitely not the time. After all, he couldn't waste any more time because the Evolutionary Universe was still in danger.</p>

  <p>Time simply flew by amidst the meticulous but boring cultivation sessions.</p>

  <p>Each Godly Genius had made great progress during that time. Finally, almost everyone had gathered in the Dragon Flyer race's "Valley of Time" in the last year and chose to go into seclusion. The place contained Holy Jay's perception of time, and the time there was compressed to a certain degree. Therefore, it was the most suitable place among the six great cultivation sacred places to go into seclusion.</p>
