<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2633 Weakened </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the watchers of this world, it was safe to say that the Warden race's strength wasn't the highest.</p>

  <p>Their only duty was to maintain the world's operation. Most of the time, they didn't even need to show up in person.</p>

  <p>The space Herbert had opened for them was enough to ensure their safety, and they only needed to cast their shadows when they patrolled the world. No matter how strong the exiles were, they couldn't do anything to them.</p>

  <p>If it weren't for the conflicts between the Warden race's conservative faction and the free faction, neither the Snake Goddess nor the Nine Li race could have found this place.</p>

  <p>As the disk slowly rotated, a light blue texture suddenly appeared on its surface and gradually spread until it was completely covered.</p>

  <p>"I had always thought that when the Light of Adjudication came, all the survivors of the free faction would have been dead. I never figured trouble would arise at the last moment. This is our Warden race's fate..." the old man said before letting out a hefty sigh.</p>

  <p>"The free faction disobeyed our master's will and we firmly believe that they will fail," the woman under the cloak said once again.</p>

  <p>"The meaning of our Warden race's existence is to maintain the world's operation. We can't fail..." another voice spoke out.</p>

  <p>Many conflicts in the world were caused by situations that weren't necessarily black or white.</p>

  <p>The free faction wanted nothing more than to pursue their goal, while the conservative faction followed Herbert's orders. The exiles wanted to escape this world, and Luo Zheng wanted to return to the divine land.</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>Once the disk had spun to a certain extent, a crisp sound suddenly rang out.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, the light blue texture was now covering the entire disk. If one was to look down from the sky above, they'd see that this texture formed the exact shape of a three-eyed monkey!</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As this faint blue light continued floating, it gradually rose from the disk.</p>

  <p>It turned into a light blue shadow in the image of a three-eyes monkey.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, Master!"</p>

  <p>All of the Warden race's members standing on the disk suddenly knelt to the ground.</p>

  <p>The old man looked solemn and devout. Although the other people were covered beneath their black robes, one could easily assume that they were wearing the same expression as the old man.</p>

  <p>They knew that Herbert wasn't actually in this world. The master had left a long time ago and no one knew when he'd be back, but in their hearts, the master was still a sacred being.</p>

  <p>Creak!</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the three-eyed monkey opened its big mouth and let out a shrill scream. The overwhelming howl spread for miles.</p>

  <p>Along with the howl, countless spots of light spurted out from the three-eyed monkey's open mouth. The light spots spread in all directions.</p>

  <p>As these light spots swept past the warriors on the disk, they shot into their bodies.</p>

  <p>Even the old man, standing directly in the middle of the disk, was unable to avoid them completely.</p>

  <p>Out of nowhere, he was hit by a blue light dot and his body trembled violently. He quickly reached out and clenched his fists, smiling helplessly. "My strength has weakened so much..."</p>

  <p>The young man with purple hair also stretched his body and said, "I feel unprecedentedly powerless, like a useless mortal and no less..."</p>

  <p>"I feel it too, and I definitely don't like it," said a woman under a cloak.</p>

  <p>The old man smiled faintly. "Who, in their right mind, would like this? If we fight Emily and the others head on, we will definitely lose. At least now, we're all at the same level, and we have the weapons provided by our master."</p>

  <p>The peculiar light dots started spreading out from the disk, and then circled around, moving far and wide.</p>

  <p>It wasn't before long that the light spots began to spread to where Spark was. They hit him as well as the other exiles.</p>

  <p>Spark's body suddenly trembled, and his eyes opened wide with incredible emotion.</p>

  <p>He felt his soul, strength, and body begin to weaken rapidly. He could no longer feel the Other Shore, and even the connection with his inner world had been broken! He had no idea what was going on.</p>

  <p>"This, this is..." Spark stuttered in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>The other exiles were in the exact same state as Spark. Each and every one of their faces displayed a trace of trembling fear.</p>

  <p>After all, they had nearly lost every ounce of strength and power they had!</p>

  <p>The Warden race had once told Spark that if his joint attack with the exiles of small races failed, then the Warden race would be forced to take action. The fact that the Warden race would even dare use such a method had never crossed his mind.</p>

  <p>"What kind of token is it, anyway? What's their purpose in suppressing our power to such an extent?" an exile from a small race asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>An exile from the Yellow Emperor race thought for a moment, and a smile appeared on his face before he offered a response. "Our strength has been suppressed..." he began. "So Emily and the others with her would suffer the same as us!"</p>

  <p>Spark's and other exiles' eyes suddenly lit up with excitement when they heard this. They immediately realized the Warden race's intention of doing so.</p>

  <p>The blue light dots were still spreading. The energy seemed very soft, even harmless, but in fact, it was irresistible.</p>

  <p>Beneath the high platforms, Emily still walked in front, followed by the others behind her.</p>

  <p>It was then that a piercing roar suddenly pierced everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>"Look! Over there! What's that?"</p>

  <p>Someone in the crowd had noticed the blue dots before anyone else.</p>

  <p>Emily's gaze swept across the blue light spots. She raised her eyebrows, tapped her toes on the ground, and her body quickly retreated backwards.</p>

  <p>However, these light dots spread at an extremely fast speed. Even Emily wasn't capable of dodging them without using spatial transference.</p>

  <p>As soon as the light spots penetrated her body, she let out a muffled groan and her legs went weak. She nearly fell to her knees.</p>

  <p>Everyone around her was experiencing the same thing she was.</p>

  <p>As the light spots continued touching them, they could feel their strength escaping them vigorously. The degree at which their power weakened was far beyond their imagination.</p>

  <p>"What the hell is going on here?"</p>

  <p>"I've never felt so weak in all my life before!"</p>

  <p>"??"</p>

  <p>Timotheus's, Leopold's, Ramzi's and the many other exiles' faces darkened at once. They didn't understand what was going on and felt furious.</p>

  <p>"Is... is this the Strength Equalizing token that you've mentioned before?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood still and asked No. 9527 after he felt the change occurring in his body.</p>

  <p>As the light dots entered his body, he immediately felt like he had lost everything.</p>

  <p>His previously indestructible body now became extremely fragile, no different from that of a basic mortal.</p>

  <p>As No. 9527 had mentioned something about the Strength Equalizing token to him before, Luo Zheng thus wasn't surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes, when this specific truth token is activated, all the creatures in the space are weakened to the same level. Look at Emily, her strength is at the same level as yours now..." No. 9527 replied.</p>

  <p>As he heard this response, Luo Zheng smiled bitterly. "This isn't good news."</p>

  <p>The exiles of the large races were the most important figures and more so, everyone relied on them. If Emily, Timotheus and the other powerful warriors' strength had suddenly plummeted, then it was safe to say that this was a disaster.</p>
