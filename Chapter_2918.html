<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Occupying a holy spring was not an easy task.</p>

  <p>In fact, it would not be easy for Sword Chen to rush into the spring even if there was nothing to interfere with him.</p>

  <p>The stronger one was, the fiercer the holy spring's counterattack would be.</p>

  <p>After four hours, he took a quick break and then resumed to attack the holy spring again.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was fortunate enough that no one dared to fight with him to compete for the holy spring, making him feel more relaxed.</p>

  <p>Finally, after half a day of fighting, he passed the test of the holy spring.</p>

  <p>All the fighting had hurt him badly, but after passing the test, he didn't mind the wounds at all.</p>

  <p>To him, if he could make it and become a Holy Being, then all his efforts would not be in vain.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, cupping his hands joyfully at Zheng, he walked towards the holy spring.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the silver holy spring water suddenly poured out of the spring and started to wash his body.</p>

  <p>While bathing in the holy spring, Zheng noticed that the spring water couldn't penetrate his body, let alone enter his inner world.</p>

  <p>However, this was a different case for Sword Chen as the silver water continuously merged into his body, flowing along his meridians and reuniting in his elixir field.</p>

  <p>Not long after, he was transformed into a shiny "silver man."</p>

  <p>Sword Chen shining with utmost luster attracted a lot of people's attention.</p>

  <p>The holy spring water continued to gather, and a stream of silver water suddenly appeared on Sword Chen's head.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Immediately, the silver water soared into the sky, which then vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a strong and sudden space fluctuation came from the divine land. Soon after, a thunder-like roar spread throughout the divine land.</p>

  <p>This sound of thunder, however, resembled that of a collapsing universe.</p>

  <p>But the people from the divine land had also made it clear that ever since the Mountain of Holy Beings had appeared, the sound could also mean that some Holy Being was creating their universe.</p>

  <p>"Another warrior has become a Holy Being!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder who it is this time."</p>

  <p>"It's so fast that someone has become a Holy Being, much faster than the previous times. The Mountain of Holy Beings has not even been opened for one day, and yet that Holy Being's universe has already been built!"</p>

  <p>Having felt the movement from their feet, the disciples in the Floating Islands were filled with envy. From that day forward, there would be another powerful clan that would rise above the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, somewhere in the divine land, Estelle raised her head and looked at the vast sky. Blinking her light brown eyes, she asked, "Who do you think has become a Holy Being?"</p>

  <p>Thinking for a while, Holy Jay replied, "Zheng, maybe."</p>

  <p>Nodding, Estelle responded, "I hope that all of them can make it."</p>

  <p>It would take a long time to construct a universe.</p>

  <p>Crossing his legs, Sword Chen sat in the holy spring. The water continuously went into his elixir field, merging with his inner world and occasionally shooting from his head and into the sky.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, in a certain sky of the divine land, a ball of silver light was rapidly expanding.</p>

  <p>And this silver light was the core of the universe.</p>

  <p>It took a long time for the core of the universe to mature, and that would take place after a Holy Being left the Mountain of Holy Beings. It usually took several thousand years for a Holy Being to consolidate their own cultivation.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the other side, Leland's test was also about to come to an end.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen's big noise in becoming a Holy Being did not bother him at all, for it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and he should not screw it up.</p>

  <p>With that, the fight for the remaining three holy springs also became very fiery.</p>

  <p>Most of the weaker Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods had already withdrawn from the competition for the remaining three holy springs, but this didn't mean that they had really given up. If they had the chance, they would naturally seize the opportunity.</p>

  <p>All the people who were left to contend for the three holy springs were elites among the Demi-holy Beings.</p>

  <p>They not only had to be on guard against each other's sneak attack, but also had to face the test from the holy springs. With their progress naturally being very slow, it appeared that no one could make it in a short time.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Leland finally passed the test of the holy spring and began to bathe in it.</p>

  <p>Blinking his eyes, Zheng looked towards the end of the plain. Lightly tapping his toes, he flew up, leaving the holy springs behind.</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng left the place, some of the people in the area noticed what he was doing and cast a cunning and pitiful look at him.</p>

  <p>"Aww, how could that be? Zheng is so powerful and yet the holy spring doesn't approve him."</p>

  <p>"What a pity that such a good opportunity is wasted!"</p>

  <p>"He looks calm and indifferent. But I can tell that he must be pretending.</p>

  <p>Poor Zheng. Deep inside, he must be crying."</p>

  <p>Disappointed, Zheng could not deny the sadness on his face that he was unable to become a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>But after all, compared with the people from the divine land, he was a man of a broader outlook. And besides, No. 9527 didn't take this place seriously.</p>

  <p>So Zheng wasn't that sad like the other people had assumed.</p>

  <p>Ever since he entered the Mountain of Holy Beings, the Infinity Ruler in his mind kept on pointing to the end of the plain.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know how big this place was, so he flew in the direction that the Infinity Ruler directed him to. About an hour later, he finally saw silver mountains at the end of the plain.</p>

  <p>Just like the entrance, there was also a valley at the end of the plain.</p>

  <p>After entering the valley, Zheng continued to go forward, but soon found that the valley was a dead end, and the entrance of a maze he imagined did not appear.</p>

  <p>"How could this be? The Infinity Ruler led me to this place." Zheng's brows creased slightly in confusion.</p>

  <p>He moved a few steps, and the Infinity Ruler rolled lightly in his mind again. Afterwards, he looked at a silver mountain wall not far away.</p>

  <p>The flickering light on the mountain wall was brighter than that on the surrounding walls. It was difficult to notice it without looking carefully.</p>

  <p>"Is it here?"</p>

  <p>Zheng rushed towards the mountain wall without hesitation.</p>

  <p>As soon as he came into contact with the mountain wall, silver light flashed in front of him and he was inside the mountain.</p>

  <p>In front of him was a long and dark corridor.</p>

  <p>"Wow, it is indeed the entrance of the maze." A helpless smile appeared on Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The entrance to the maze had always been located in the Mountain of Holy Beings, and for so many divine eras, countless consummate True Gods and Demi-holy Beings had come into the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>There must have been someone exploring the internal space of the Mountain of Holy Beings in curiosity, and someone must have found the valley that existed at the other end of the plain.</p>

  <p>However, only Bromley had found the entrance to the maze. He must have entered the maze accidentally.</p>

  <p>Observing the place for a short while, Zheng continued to walk forward along the passageway of the maze.</p>

  <p>After he turned two corners along the passageway, a familiar feeling came into being.</p>

  <p>When he was at the end of the True Path, he passed through a similar maze which was created by Bromley. That maze was a copy of this one.</p>

  <p>Back then, Bromley had walked through the maze for quite a while, but he found that he couldn't pass the maze, so he had no choice but to leave.</p>

  <p>Zheng, on the other hand, was different. Every time he took a turn in the maze, the Infinity Ruler in his mind would show him the right path. And if he faced two or three crossings, he could still make the right choice with the help of the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>After a couple of turns, Zheng moved smoothly through the maze with the help of the Infinity Ruler.</p>
