<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4062 The Mist City </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The white mist gradually spread throughout the Mist City on the main Pure Sky Platform, striking terror in the hearts of those who were there.</p>

  <p>A few of the more powerful beings took away a small part of the white mist through their own methods.</p>

  <p>More white mist turned into the streets, towers, walls, and grounds in this city.</p>

  <p>From the outside, nothing looked out of the ordinary. However, the streets, towers, walls, and even the grounds would turn into monsters that would devour the creatures at any time.</p>

  <p>On one of the broad streets within the city, a snow-white snake wriggled his body, slithering at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>From the other side of the street, three birds spread their wings and launched themselves into the air.</p>

  <p>"Friends..."</p>

  <p>The snake sang wistfully.</p>

  <p>The song sounded like a cry of grief, a call to his companions.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The snake's singing caught the attention of the three birds, who then swerved in the air to fly towards the little white snake.</p>

  <p>Their beady eyes dilated in a craze as they ferociously pecked at the body of the white snake.</p>

  <p>As they attacked him, they released more and more intense energy, until their bodies turned red.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The three birds had worked themselves up into such a frenzy that they exploded violently, one after the other. The explosion caused a terrible shock wave that rippled across the city.</p>

  <p>Everything in this city was made of white mist.</p>

  <p>As the shock wave shook everything, the structures momentarily lost their forms and turned into white mist.</p>

  <p>However, the hapless structures only lasted a while. After a few moments, they returned to their original shapes.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the white snake's body was left in pieces by the explosion. As a Treacherous Being, he could have turned into various shapes, but the three birds released a considerable amount of Light of Annihilation when they exploded.</p>

  <p>The Light of Annihilation was fatal to the hostility-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>As for the resentment-level and hatred-level Treacherous Beings, their bodies would change dramatically if they were hit by the Light of Annihilation.</p>

  <p>The resentment-level Treacherous Beings would permanently lose the ability to change into different forms. As a result, their bodies would also become very fragile, making them easy targets.</p>

  <p>The white snake, with only half of his body left, could not return to his original shape. Coughing painfully, he leaned against a corner of the wall weakly.</p>

  <p>In the Mist City, one's only hope to survive was by constantly walking.</p>

  <p>The white snake could no longer move. He could only sit back and watch as the wall behind him softened and slowly turned into white mist.</p>

  <p>However, he was not too scared.</p>

  <p>In the secondary world, Treacherous Beings were immortal.</p>

  <p>If he were to be devoured by the white mist here and now, he was bound to be revived somewhere in the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>At this point, Treacherous Beings in the Jade Pure Realm could no longer remember how many times they had been killed and revived.</p>

  <p>Almost every one of the Treacherous Beings that had awakened had experienced over a thousand cycles of reincarnation and death.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, they found this very exciting.</p>

  <p>However, as time went by, they grew bored as the cycle began to feel repetitive.</p>

  <p>For example, they had captured the Mist City hundreds of times.</p>

  <p>In order to consolidate the city, they set their revival coordinates here right after capturing it, but in the end, they were all killed, and even their coordinates were removed.</p>

  <p>However, this didn't stop them from capturing the Mist City repeatedly over time.</p>

  <p>This kind of behavior became extremely ridiculous and boring as it was an endless cycle.</p>

  <p>Wasn't it just a city that contained the Void Dust?</p>

  <p>What if they obtained a portion of the Void Dust that could be controlled?</p>

  <p>Could it determine the victory of this war?</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, although these awakened Treacherous Beings had their own self consciousness, they worked for the Four Spirits Sect. They could only follow the orders of the senior leaders of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>Complaining would solve nothing.</p>

  <p>The same thing happened in other areas in the Mist City.</p>

  <p>At first, the white snakes could only hide in the north of the Mist City. If they attempted to cross the center line of the city, the birds would instantly eliminate them.</p>

  <p>Now, as more and more snakes were swarming into the Mist City, the snakes felt emboldened. They began to spread to other areas in the city.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, several black eagles stood perched on a gate tower in the south of the Mist City.</p>

  <p>The gate tower was also made of white mist.</p>

  <p>As aforementioned, all creatures that came into contact with the white mist were doomed to be devoured. Those black eagles were no exception.</p>

  <p>However, every time the gate tower began to twist and deform into white mist, the black eagles would flap their wings and hover above the gate tower.</p>

  <p>Then, when the gate tower returned to its original shape, the eagles would land on it once more.</p>

  <p>"The battle is coming to an end," the black eagle at the far right commented.</p>

  <p>The Bird Spirit Sect once had four branches. These black eagles came from one of them.</p>

  <p>"It's not a big deal if we lose the Mist City," the black eagle in the lead said coldly. "We can always take it back later."</p>

  <p>The black eagle that had just spoken had three purple luminescent feathers on his head that shone beautifully. He was the leader of this branch.</p>

  <p>"But if we give up the Mist City, we will also have to give up all the spoils we got in the battle of the Wine Basin," a black figure pointed out.</p>

  <p>The leader's eyes dimmed gloomily. "They have lost once in the battle of the Wine Basin. Even if they make a comeback now, they will still be defeated in the end. Don't worry."</p>

  <p>Just as the leader was speaking, a bird flew over.</p>

  <p>The bird whispered something to them, while they listened attentively.</p>

  <p>After a short while, their originally gloomy eyes lit up with excitement.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"They have retreated?"</p>

  <p>"They have left the Mist City?"</p>

  <p>The black eagles couldn't believe their ears!</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters were so close to capturing the Mist City. The eagles led their team to fight them off, but they were just beginning to feel like it was futile.</p>

  <p>Now, they received news that the Snake Masters were retreating. Such good luck!</p>

  <p>"Is it a trap?" the leader asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"The Mist City can devour everything left behind. It's impossible for them to set up traps in the city. Once they leave, it's back to square one for them," a black eagle answered reassuringly with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>"You're right. Even if they try to play tricks, it wouldn't work. They've given up the Mist City!" another black eagle agreed.</p>

  <p>"Let the birds inspect the entire Mist City," the leader ordered.</p>

  <p>Soon, thousands of birds spread their wings and flew across the Mist City, carefully inspecting each street.</p>

  <p>But they didn't find anything suspicious.</p>

  <p>After they reported what they saw, the leader heaved a sigh of relief. By now, he was sure the Snake Masters had retreated.</p>

  <p>The other black eagles scratched their heads, confused as to why the Snake Masters had given up even though they were so close to victory. Sheepishly, they all turned to their leader, who stood perched in the center.</p>

  <p>The leader's eyes still couldn't shake off the feeling of suspicion. Uneasy, he helplessly returned the gazes of his constituents. It was just too strange!</p>

  <p>If the Snake Masters ended up taking the Mist City, the leader would've felt less unsettled.</p>

  <p>But they had given up. This could only mean one thing: there was something more important to them than the Mist City.</p>

  <p>The leader frowned deeply as he pondered over this. If the Snake Masters captured the Mist City, they could take back the Wine Basin. What could possibly be more important than that?</p>

  <p>"I'm going to visit someone. I should be able to get an answer there."</p>

  <p>After saying that, the leader flapped his wings and flew away.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the Source World, several black ships were floating in a clear lake in the Roaring Lake Province.</p>

  <p>The water of the lake was so clear that it was almost mirror-like.</p>

  <p>During the battle against the Pear Hill, the Black Ship suffered great losses, but not as heavy as those of the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race.</p>

  <p>Most of their crew survived.</p>

  <p>But when the Evil God was appointed as the new captain, the crew was enraged.</p>

  <p>Since then, they made all kinds of excuses to try to escape from the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>According to the rules of the Black Ship, those who escaped would be regarded as traitors and would be chased down by the Black Ship.</p>

  <p>But the former captain had never treated them like this. The former captain let them leave if they wanted to. Now, the Black Ship didn't carry any of the old traditions, just their name.</p>
