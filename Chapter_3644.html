  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pearce, Auden and the leaders of the seven mountains all had very sharp insights.</p>

  <p>Because of this, ordinary hiding skills could never deceive them.</p>

  <p>However, the method the Jin Wu used was one they had never seen coming.</p>

  <p>It was for this reason that they failed to see through the Jin Wu, even if they did everything in their power. This was also why Pearce didn't dare to act rashly.</p>

  <p>Just then, a cocky voice rang through space. It was no other than Springer.</p>

  <p>"Humph, are you blaming me? What a damn shame! Over a hundred Corpse Spirit Jin Wu were gifted to your Divine Lair, but they were all taken away while the Sky Net is still there intact. What a joke," Springer said sarcastically.</p>

  <p>Even if he was rude, he was right. And as a super force, the Jin Wu had several branches to use for their advantage.</p>

  <p>Found in these branches and the Divine Lair, were the royal guards of Emperor Di Jun. Among these guards was Springer, who was given a status and strength that was on a par with Phoenix's.</p>

  <p>Any race would know that a hundred Corpse Spirit Jin Wu would be a great advantage and weapon of destruction. The Jin Wu could not tolerate such a loss. While it was Springer who came up with the plan, he'd want to put the blame on Phoenix.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Phoenix, your Divine Lair is too lame," another voice spoke out.</p>

  <p>"Over a hundred Corpse Spirit Jin Wu are more than enough to annihilate an ordinary great force!"</p>

  <p>Phoenix pursed her lips. "If it were you, what would you have done? You saw how Luo Zheng stole the Jin Wu away. Who could have stopped him?"</p>

  <p>Springer suddenly said, "I will kill him before he gets close."</p>

  <p>However, not many agreed with this. One voice expressed this very clearly,</p>

  <p>"I don't agree with you on this, Springer. It is easy to be wise after the event. Could you foresee he was able to take away the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu just like that?" The voice was shrill, almost anxious and angry at the same time.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be many powerful people gathered in the space.</p>

  <p>"You're right. It's not Phoenix's fault! The human boy is to blame," another voice cried out. "I'm still puzzled by him and how he'd managed to take away the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu."</p>

  <p>As they continued to argue, it came to a common conclusion. What happened was so strange, that it could have only been possible if Emperor Di Jun had intervened.</p>

  <p>Phoenix's eyes narrowed slightly as she spotted Luo Zheng from a distance.</p>

  <p>"There's no point arguing about this. We have already lost the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu, and the Sky Net can't be broken in a short amount of time," she said hurriedly. "What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Springer rose up in the space. He resembled a human being, but had a pair of black, powerful wings behind him. These wings clattered with every flap as if they were made of metal.</p>

  <p>"Pearce is as smart as a fox," Springer pointed out. "Now that the Corpse Spirit Jin Wu have been taken away, he would keep on defending at all costs."</p>

  <p>"True. The Six-flame Array has been set up, and it would be difficult to change plans now..." another person said.</p>

  <p>Similar to the Sky Net, the Six-flame Array was found to be a very powerful array.</p>

  <p>The main difference between the two were their uses: the Sky Net was used for defense while the Six-flame Array was used for attacks.</p>

  <p>"Then we must wait. Maybe Emperor Di Jun will come," Phoenix said calmly.</p>

  <p>Despite all their efforts, the Jin Wu still had the upper hand. It was only a matter of time until they broke through the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>"Indeed! I think a stalemate would be the best decision for now."</p>

  <p>"Just let them live a few more days!"</p>

  <p>"We are not in a hurry, anyway."</p>

  <p>One by one, the people in the space expressed their agreement.</p>

  <p>Though the Jin Wu would be willing to enter a stalemate, this was not what the Taiyi Heaven Palace thought.</p>

  <p>Back then, when Pearce followed Eastern Emperor Taiyi, he was not only powerful in strength, but also resourceful.</p>

  <p>It was because of this that he could see through every move of the Jin Wu. However, due to the insufficient strength of the Taiyi Heaven Palace and his low prestige, he couldn't command or ask help from the powerful masters of other six mountains. Thus, he was put in a passive situation.</p>

  <p>In this case, the Sky Net would collapse sooner or later, which could cause chaos.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng accidentally stole the Jin Wu which allowed for the situation to be reversed.</p>

  <p>This brought Pearce on his toes, and his eyes flashed with a dazzling light.</p>

  <p>The communication rune in his hand lit up once again as he ordered, "Flip the Sky Net!"</p>

  <p>"Wait? Flip the Sky Net?" As Goran heard Pearce's order, his heart skipped a beat.</p>

  <p>Even Auden, who was usually stoic, revealed a trace of surprise.</p>

  <p>The Sky Net was used for defense, but flipping it around could make it become a fierce weapon of attack.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this decision too hasty? After all, Eastern Emperor Taiyi is not here yet... " Auden asked, hesitating to proceed.</p>

  <p>However, Pearce's face was painted with determination. "This is not a rash move. There is only one chance for us," he said firmly. "Since Luo Zheng has made them suffer a great loss, we'd have to seize this opportunity or else he would have done it for absolutely nothing."</p>

  <p>"Flip the Sky Net! The Golden Array and the Ivory Array, move south. The Curved Spirit Pass, the Battle Rage Pass, head north. The Bright Array..."</p>

  <p>Pearce ordered.</p>

  <p>Aside from the Mountain Sea Pass and the Vastness Array, the remaining arrays and passes all turned around towards different directions.</p>

  <p>Originally, the Sky Net closed in on the Jin Wu from both sides.</p>

  <p>According to Pearce's orders, the two sides of the Sky Net advanced forward. In this way, the Golden Array and the Bright Array which were on the ends of the two sides would meet, forming a circle, enveloping the entire Jin Wu right at the center of the Sky Net!</p>

  <p>Before, no warrior of the seven mountains wanted to be the first to fight.</p>

  <p>However, through cooperation with each other, their plan moved so smoothly.</p>

  <p>Just like that, the six arrays of the mountains and eleven passes all moved in sync with the Sky Net!</p>

  <p>When it all started happening, the Jin Wu didn't notice. They were complacent in the fact that their strong warriors and Phoenix were hiding not too far away in front of the Mountain Sea Pass. The only ones left at the back were the Jin Wu of lower intelligence.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Phoenix concentrated on deploying the forces as she planned to summon more Jin Wu from the North Unicorn Province.</p>

  <p>An hour had passed and she found a large group of Jin Wu that remained in a place eight hundred miles behind her. Puzzled by what she saw, she released her spiritual sense and her face changed slightly. "The Sky Net..." she said, "is trapping us in it!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Phoenix finished speaking, the surface of the once translucent net emitted a bright red glow. Just then, the surging killing intent spread along with the glow, as if it could kill anything that approached it. The Sky Net was now one big killing machine.</p>

  <p>At this time, the voice of Pearce rang out.</p>

  <p>"Shrink!"</p>

  <p>The Sky Net which had turned into a huge circle began to shrink inch by inch!</p>

  <p>As the Sky Net shrank, the distance between the seven mountains and the twelve passes grew closer. Eventually, it would trap the Jin Wu, and seven mountains would also attack together. With the Jin Wu trapped in the center, they would all have great advantages to win.</p>

  <p>"What a smart move!"</p>

  <p>Gethin praised from the Vastness Array.</p>

  <p>"And throughout the execution, not once was the Vastness Mountain needed. I have underestimated that Pearce!" Natasha said coldly.</p>

  <p>The entire Sky Net began to fold right from the Vastness Array and the Mountain Sea Pass. This also meant that there was no need for the Vastness Mountain to move. Since the Vastness Mountain already had plans of rebelling, this move fueled their suspicion that they might have been exposed.</p>
