</p>

  <p>As Li Luoshui spoke about the grudges from the last generation, all sorts of feelings welled up in Luo Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>If only the Holy Beings could work together and kill the Yellow Emperor Guards, then perhaps everything would be just fine.</p>

  <p>No one could have expected Li Luoshui to make an already bad situation worse, though.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder people always attributed the fall of a country to Helen of Troy.</p>

  <p>That said, it wasn't Li Luoshui's fault.</p>

  <p>After all, Nicholas' ambition wasn't only to target Li Luoshui. What was more, he had no desire of being trapped in the divine land.</p>

  <p>"Where is the Yellow Emperor Guard released by Nicholas?" Luo Zheng asked again, more adamantly this time.</p>

  <p>Either a Nine Li Guard or a Yellow Emperor Guard should be an Other Shore Realm warrior and more so, they had to be of Harper's rank.</p>

  <p>It just didn't make sense that such a powerful warrior had never appeared in the divine land before.</p>

  <p>With Nicholas' personality and such a powerful support, he might have already destroyed the Sword Clan and the Moon Clan, and unified the divine land. How could he even tolerate the existence of these independent wealthy clans?</p>

  <p>"He's hiding in the dark," said Li Luoshui, her eyes revealing a sudden, deep light. "I hid in the depths of the ground to avoid being chased by the Yellow Emperor Guard. That time, he also sneaked into the ground to hunt me down. However, I beat him back instead."</p>

  <p>"Mother, is your strength really equivalent to that of the Yellow Emperor Guard?" A strange expression could now be seen on Luo Zheng's face.</p>

  <p>The strength that Li Luoshui displayed was extremely powerful. So much so, that it could kill a fiend like Edmond? that wasn't to be denied.</p>

  <p>That said however, there should still be a considerable gap in strength between her and the Yellow Emperor Guard.</p>

  <p>"I defeated him with the help of the Spiritual Darknesses and the Malicious Monsters around me. Moreover, among all the Yellow Emperor Guards, a few of them were very powerful, but certain others were considerably weak. The guard released by Nicholas was the weakest one among them, actually," she explained.</p>

  <p>"So, that's how it is, huh?" Luo Zheng finally understood what was going on.</p>

  <p>The monsters hiding in the stones under the ground were indeed very powerful, enough to protect his mother.</p>

  <p>"The Yellow Emperor Guard might have no way of dealing with you, but he can kill other Holy Beings aside from Nicholas. Wouldn't it be better to only leave the Dongfang Clan behind? After all, Nicholas is his ally.</p>

  <p>Or he could have completely controlled the forbidden areas with his own ability," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"Although our Nine Li race was destroyed, not everyone is dead. We still have a chance of fighting against them!" she said. "Besides, your father told me before he left that he had arranged everything. He even asked me to wait for him until he came back!"</p>

  <p>At the mention of Luo Xiao, a gleam of light flashed in her eyes. Luo Zheng saw it right away.</p>

  <p>As he looked at his mother's expression, Luo Zheng sighed silently to himself and his heart sank a little. Although his mother was dissatisfied with his father's arrangement, she still trusted him.</p>

  <p>"But it wasn't until today when I saw you that I realized your father's real ambition wasn't just to solve the crisis in the divine land," she said.</p>

  <p>Finally, the conversation was coming full circle and making its way back to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand." Luo Zheng blinked a few times, his expression blank.</p>

  <p>She smiled and said, "When I was born, the Nine Li race had already fallen into depression. However, it was still one of the most powerful races in the Source World. Not many people, of all the tens of thousands of civilians, were capable of creating the Sanskrit land before reaching the Other Shore Realm. Even if there were, they could only create the Ten Sanskrit Land or Hundred Sanskrit Land. In fact, only a mere ten people could create a Thousand Sanskrit Land."</p>

  <p>"Only ten people in all?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't exactly sure what that meant.</p>

  <p>His mother smiled, "Yes, the top warrior among these ten people is Chiyou, the leader of our Nine Li race. As for the other nine, they are the heads of the nine tribes of our Nine Li race."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyebrows shot upwards as he heard this.</p>

  <p>Chiyou was the man who had passed the Beginning Swordsmanship to Tianming, and was also the phantom that Luo Zheng had seen in the Divine Time Temple. He was the supreme master who created the divine land as well as the one who built this giant ship.</p>

  <p>"I even think your father himself didn't actually expect you to create the Thousand Sanskrit Land. Even with Gu Bei's Primal Chaos Technique, no matter how talented you were, you could only create a small divine land. However, creating a Thousand Sanskrit Land was utterly impossible," she said.</p>

  <p>The Primal Chaos Technique had its merits, of course. Its user cultivated the chaotic energy, and even the user's inner world was in total chaos.</p>

  <p>The Sanskrit words in Luo Zheng's inner world couldn't have come out of nowhere, either.</p>

  <p>Back in the universe, Luo Zheng had invited Luo Xiao's energy soul into his inner world. When Luo Xiao observed the a thousand and eighty Sanskrit words, he was greatly shocked, too. He couldn't figure out where the Sanskrit words had even come from.</p>

  <p>"Think about it. Your grandfather's blood hasn't completely shown on me. It should be completely inherited by you," said she, now staring at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"My grandfather?" Luo Zheng was stunned once more. "Who's my grandfather?</p>

  <p>I've never heard of him before."</p>

  <p>She smiled, "What a silly boy! I am Chiyou's daughter, and you are my son. Now tell me, who is your grandpa?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heard, but he looked as though he was deaf.</p>

  <p>He was completely lost for words.</p>

  <p>He had never imagined that his life story would be so complicated!</p>

  <p>Every time he thought that he had discovered the truth and figured everything out, he was surprised out of his mind time and time again when new information was revealed.</p>

  <p>While in the universe, he randomly discovered that his father had actually created that place.</p>

  <p>And after he'd arrived at the divine land, he found out that it was in fact built by his grandfather.</p>

  <p>All this, everything he was learning, was all unbelievable!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng kept silent for a long time. Before he could utter a single word, she walked up to him quickly and held his face in her hands. "Although my father told me that the hopes of the Nine Li race were in this ship before we fled from the Source World, I knew very well that we didn't have any way out without the support of the Source World.</p>

  <p>And that's what I've always thought before meeting you, Luo Zheng. Now, the only hope that could support my life is to see your father again!</p>

  <p>Also, I finally understand what my father meant.</p>

  <p>He was right. I did see hope.</p>

  <p>And that hope was you, Luo Zheng! It is you!"</p>

  <p>His mother was talking loudly, in a trembling voice. Obviously, she was very excited.</p>

  <p>It was in that exact moment that things began to change.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's mood also took a subtle turn.</p>

  <p>A blazing flame suddenly ignited in his heart, burning all the pressure out.</p>

  <p>For this woman, for his mother, he was more willing than ever to move forward.</p>

  <p>Staring at her with his firm eyes, Luo Zheng replied, "Mother, trust me, I won't let you down."</p>

  <p>She nodded confidently, with a serene smile plastered on her face.</p>

  <p>It was then that a voice rang out expectantly. "Mother, I won't let you down either!"</p>

  <p>Yan had come to herself, out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>"Yan, were you eavesdropping this entire time?" Luo Zheng pursed his lips helplessly as he waited an answer.</p>

  <p>Their mother smiled, "I knew she'd woken up."</p>

  <p>Yan made a silly face and turned around in order to hold her mother in her arms tightly.</p>

  <p>The two of them didn't look like mother and daughter at all. They looked so much alike, in fact, that they could be mistaken for twins, only with opposite temperaments.</p>
