  <p>
</p>

  <p>Brylee was furious. Her eyes were burning with anger and humiliation at her mistake.</p>

  <p>A spurt of killing intent gushed out from her body. She was about to rush to Sally when the golden flame behind her exploded with a deafening bang.</p>

  <p>She quickly turned around. Panic appeared on her face, Lesly was sent flying onto the wall of the cave. Zheng floated in the air, surrounded by the divine flames of the Sun Crow race. The fire that burned around him left him completely unharmed.</p>

  <p>"He's very powerful," Brylee murmured to herself.</p>

  <p>She and Lesly would not make the mistake of underestimating Zheng.</p>

  <p>After the two of them had broken into the cave, Lesly went to attack Zheng while Brylee fought the others.</p>

  <p>They had thought that after Brylee killed Sally and Chaim, they would surely be able to defeat Zheng.</p>

  <p>But their plan fell apart immediately, because Lesly couldn't withstand even a single blow from Zheng.</p>

  <p>Lesly was stuck in a big rock, and her eyes, usually so bright and charming, were now dark with fear and anger. Under the burning of her wings, the rock slowly melted into scorching lava.</p>

  <p>"I don't care if you attack me, but you will pay if you try to kill my friends,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said coldly, glaring at the two demon women.</p>

  <p>He had wanted to get a sense of their intentions before hitting them with any strong attacks, but one of them had gone directly for Sally and Chaim.</p>

  <p>As a result, Zheng was forced to immediately deal a heavy blow against Lesly.</p>

  <p>Zheng moved forward. The rock beneath his feet cracked as he rushed at Brylee with lightning speed.</p>

  <p>Lesly shouted out a warning, "Brylee! Run! He is not afraid of fire!" Lesly had just suffered a crippling loss and she feared Brylee was about to meet the same fate.</p>

  <p>Brylee's divine flames were quite fierce, and far strong than those of the other demon women of the Sun Crow race. At Lesly's words, she withdrew the divine flames she had been about to blast at Zheng. Instead, she spread her wings and flew upwards.</p>

  <p>By then, Lesly had freed herself from the rock. She had not been seriously hurt by Zheng's punch, and she unfurled her wings and rose in the air. She called to Brylee, "Let's go! We must retreat for now!"</p>

  <p>The divine flame was the most powerful weapon of the Sun Crow race, and they had expected to use it to defeat Zheng. But since Zheng was not at all threatened by the flames, they had no chance of winning this battle, so they had to retreat and figure out a different plan.</p>

  <p>"You're already here! Why don't you stay a bit longer?" Zheng taunted.</p>

  <p>He accelerated as he flew into the air, chasing Brylee.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't have the flexibility and agility of the Sun Crow race in flight, but he was able to gain enough momentum to outpace Brylee's speed. Even though she was flying away as rapidly as she could, Zheng drew closer and closer to her.</p>

  <p>"Get down!"</p>

  <p>Lesly, in flight behind Zheng, raised her eyebrows and took out an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"Go!"</p>

  <p>She waved two fingers in the air. Shining awls appeared midair and flew towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>She didn't expect to kill Zheng, but she needed to force him to slow down before he could catch Brylee.</p>

  <p>The shining awls had a very strong penetrating power. If Zheng failed to dodge them, they would pierce his skin and leave bleeding injuries on his body.</p>

  <p>Zheng snorted.</p>

  <p>He summoned the Shade Stone liquid to protect his back.</p>

  <p>There was a series of clanging sounds as the awls hit Zheng one after another.</p>

  <p>The shining awls could penetrate almost everything, but they couldn't penetrate Zheng's back. Lesly's mouth dropped open in shock. Brylee, glancing behind her, saw what happened and was also stunned.</p>

  <p>Brylee gritted her teeth. She spread her wings and pushed forward with all her strength, trying to fly faster. But her struggle was in vain. Since Lesly's attack had not slowed him down even a little, Zheng flew closer to Brylee. He was an arm's length from catching her.</p>

  <p>At that moment, however, the black smog of the Chaotic Source World started to surge around them again.</p>

  <p>The arrival of the black smog was an enormous advantage for Brylee and Lesly. As members of the Sun Crow race, they had a much better sense of wind than most other creatures. As soon as they sensed a hurricane coming, they realized with excitement that there was a way to escape Zheng.</p>

  <p>The winds swirled and surged more and more strongly around them.</p>

  <p>Zheng was just about to grasp Brylee when an irresistible force swept over them.</p>

  <p>The hurricane separated Zheng from Brylee. Zheng tried to stick to his course, but he soon lost his sense of direction in the black smog.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Zheng is getting blown away!"</p>

  <p>Sally and Chaim, still at the bottom of the cave, crouched down as the hurricane burst into the hole. The pit protected them. The hurricane couldn't sweep them away.</p>

  <p>Zheng was unable to resist the hurricane, but the two demon women remained steady.</p>

  <p>Brylee and Lesly spread their wings and rode the hurricane, quickly putting some distance between themselves and Zheng. He couldn't chase after them anymore.</p>

  <p>"The hurricane came at just the right time," said Lesly, sounding relieved.</p>

  <p>"What should we do now?" Brylee asked, in a more subdued tone. She was also happy at their escape but still felt a lingering tension at how close she had come to being captured by Zheng.</p>

  <p>"He is trapped in the strong wind. Let the hurricane take his life!"</p>

  <p>The two women angled their wings, turning in midair to follow Zheng as he was tossed and turned by the hurricane. They made sure to stay a safe distance away from him.</p>

  <p>A huge transparent crystal appeared above Lesly's head. In an instant, long spears made of heavenly crystals materialized from it.</p>

  <p>They had no trouble resisting the hurricane.</p>

  <p>Indeed, their power was multiplied by the hurricane as the pointed tips shot straight towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>As the two women had observed, Zheng was finding it difficult to adjust his position in the hurricane. Even if he could, his range of movement was limited. He grimaced and watched the spears shooting towards him.</p>

  <p>A clanging sound could be heard over the sound of the wind, as the spears hit Zheng's body and cracked into pieces upon impact. He used the Shade Stone liquid to protect himself, as he had no choice but to take the full force of the attack.</p>

  <p>A vicious smile appeared on Lesly's face. "I wonder how long you can hold on!" she called out to him.</p>

  <p>She believed that Zheng wouldn't be able to resist her heavenly crystal bombardment for too long.</p>

  <p>After all, he hadn't even reached the Chaotic Source Realm. And indeed, even if he had, he should have a limit. Beyond this limit, he would run out of strength to keep resisting the attack. Not even Zheng could withstand the power of the heavenly crystals forever!</p>

  <p>However, unbeknownst to Lesly and Brylee, Zheng had the Shade Stone liquid that was different from the Chaotic Source Spirit.</p>

  <p>Unlike the Chaotic Source Spirit, the Shade Stone couldn't absorb power, and it wouldn't get tired.</p>

  <p>As long as the Shade Stone liquid was on Zheng's back, it didn't matter how many times he was hit by the heavenly crystal spears. They wouldn't be able to pierce through his body.</p>

  <p>However, each time a heavenly crystal spear shattered into pieces on Zheng's back, he felt the force of the blow, like a powerful punch. It made his body tremble, and his vital energy quivered violently.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Zheng didn't have enough Shade Stone liquid to protect any other part of his body except his back. He was managing to angle himself so that the spears always hit his back, but eventually he would get tired and a heavenly crystal spear might pierce through his limb, or through the front of his torso. He had to figure out a way to counterattack.</p>

  <p>Brylee, also flying nearby, waved her hand and brought out an Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>She held a long, graceful bow that shone with a soft blue light. She raised the weapon and plucked at the bowstring, and a watery blue arrow appeared.</p>

  <p>"Heavenly South Bow!"</p>

  <p>This long bow was a sixth-grade Other Shore Token. It was the sacred item of a ruling civilization. The bow was the only one of its kind.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly South Bow was well-known on the Other Shore. It had been used by the last head of the Divine Lair and cherished by its people for a long time. When Brylee came along, the last head of the Divine Lair gave her the bow. Many had coveted the Heavenly South Bow, but she was the one chosen to wield this Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>"To the south!"</p>

  <p>Brylee released the bowstring. A sharp, penetrating blue light shot out from the Heavenly South Bow.</p>

  <p>As soon as the blue light burst out, Zheng felt its sharpness. His face darkened.</p>
