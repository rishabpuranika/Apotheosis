<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1022 Challenging Luo Zheng </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The entire Oracle City was preparing for this decisive battle.</p>

  <p>Every day hundreds of runes were sent from the Runic Tower and placed all over the city.</p>

  <p>Every single warrior had stopped cultivating. As the time of battle approached, the air grew thicker. Cultivating would not change much, and they needed their focus on the right place.</p>

  <p>Every day there were over a hundred spies from the World Commercial Alliance returning from the front line. The Heavenly Evil Sect had chosen to attack Oracle City. This was not a surprise attack as they openly marched towards it. Eddie felt very confident in this battle and how easy it would be to destroy the entire Oracle City.</p>

  <p>The warriors of Cloud Hall were also in Oracle City. If Ning Yudie and Luo Zheng chose to stay in the Cloud Hall, it would be a headache for Eddie because he was unable to break the sect-protecting array. Eddie was glad that the Cloud Hall had chosen to join hands with the World Commercial Alliance, and he swore to himself that he would wipe out both sects in Oracle City.</p>

  <p>If Eddie defeated the World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall, there was no force in the entire Central Region that could stop him. All the other fourth-grade sects like the Mysterious Luna Hall, Black Mountain Sect, and Bloodwood Cliff, would have no other choice other than to surrender. Eddie had already planned to slaughter all of them.</p>

  <p>"Report! The army of the Heavenly Evil Sect appears 1800 miles to the south of Oracle City!"</p>

  <p>"Report!</p>

  <p>The army of the Heavenly Evil Sect appears 1, 000 miles away from the Oracle City!"</p>

  <p>"Report! 600 miles away!"</p>

  <p>"Report!"</p>

  <p>The army of the Heavenly Evil Sect was slowly advancing and approaching Oracle City. With each closer mile, pressure grew within the World Commercial Alliance and the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>In the past few days, Ning Yudie had calmed down and recovered.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Ning Yudie were deeply entangled and felt more in love than ever. He told her that his greatest wishes were to save his sister and marry Ning Yudie in a grand ceremony. That was what he would do if he survived the battle ahead.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie protested coquettishly, "I'm the leader of Cloud Hall and you are a mere disciple. People will laugh at us."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng never cared about what other people thought and he would marry Ning Yudie despite him still being a disciple of Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>After returning to Oracle City, Ning Yudie and Luo Zheng rarely saw each other as they were both busy. The elders of Cloud Hall felt relieved seeing Ning Yudie alive and well. They needed her more than ever now that the battle was imminent. Their alliance was not as strong as the Heavenly Evil Sect. They needed their leader now more than ever.</p>

  <p>A day later Luo Zheng left the courtyard. The Heavenly Evil Sect was closely approaching the city gates. Soon it would be the time to fight.</p>

  <p>In a plain dress, Mu Ning looked calmly at Luo Zheng with a slight hint of worry on her face. She was like an ordinary wife helping her husband get dressed and straighten his clothes. "Be careful," she said in a worried and trembling voice.</p>

  <p>"I will," Luo Zheng said as he nodded his head and quickly rushed towards the meeting room in Oracle City.</p>

  <p>She waited until Luo Zheng left. Blinking her eyes, she vaguely looked in his direction and as if still speaking to him, she said, "Don't worry. I won't let you die."</p>

  <p>Her soft and gentle eyes suddenly became cold and full of grievance. She reached for her space ring and quickly took out a black Taoist robe.</p>

  <p>This was the uniform of the disciples of Ethereal Spirit Sect. She was not one of them, but when she was fourteen, she made her father give her one.</p>

  <p>A few years had passed since she last wore it, and she had grown into a fine woman. She grew a few inches taller and her body was now a woman's body. The robe didn't fit her well, but she still wore it.</p>

  <p>She would fight today wearing that robe.</p>

  <p>She would fight against Eddie for Luo Zheng, for the Xi Clan, and for the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>She was ready to face the battle. As she assured herself, Mu Ning quietly rushed out of the door.</p>

  <p>The warriors in Oracle City could see the army of the Heavenly Evil Sect now. A large number of independent warriors had joined the Heavenly Evil Sect and were orderly lined up. Warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm floated in the sky as if protecting the army from any danger coming from above. Among them were two warriors at the Life and Death Realm— Eddie and Simon.</p>

  <p>This great army was quietly standing just ten miles away from the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>There were some very strange things amidst the warriors. One of them was a huge lamp that was being held by over a hundred warriors at the Internal Elixir Realm. In the middle of the lamp was a huge unlighted black wick.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the lamp were two huge coffins. One was black and the other white. Everyone was secretly wondering what was inside those coffins.</p>

  <p>In Oracle City, Dillon, Hobbes, and Haber were ceremoniously standing at the top of the city wall silently observing the army pressing closer and closer. The Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance sat in his chair with his eyes shut in meditation.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie and the warriors of Cloud Hall were standing there as well looking at the Heavenly Evil Sect indifferently.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a flash of light floated over them, revealing Zheng's arrival.</p>

  <p>As he landed, he warmly glanced at Ning Yudie who returned the look. There was so much affection in their eyes. Luo Zheng shifted his gaze and stared at Eddie standing in the distance. Even though they were separated by ten miles, they could see each other.</p>

  <p>Eddie suddenly moved towards Oracle City while laughing crazily at the warriors standing on top of the city wall. "Our Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom will definitely control the Central Region. This is simply inevitable. As the saying goes, 'those who submit will prosper, those who resist shall perish.' The Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom represents the heavens. If you are willing to surrender, I will not refuse you and will welcome you with my arms wide open. But if you try to resist me, you are doomed."</p>

  <p>Eddie's life vitality amplified his voice and spread it so that it could be heard all across the city. His voice was loud and clear like thunder. All the warriors and mortals in Oracle City felt their ears hurt from the shock.</p>

  <p>All of the warriors in Oracle City were silent and not a single one of them moved. Eddie surely did not expect his speech to have any effect other than to raise his army's morale and lower his enemy's spirit.</p>

  <p>"Uha!"</p>

  <p>"Uha!"</p>

  <p>"Uha!"</p>

  <p>His army roared as Eddie finished speaking.</p>

  <p>Dillon was about to speak and as he opened his mouth, Luo Zheng shouted</p>

  <p>"Bullshit!" using his life vitality so that he could also be heard by everyone.</p>

  <p>His voice sounded like a clap of thunder, just as rough and assured as Eddie's. He couldn't help but to speak his mind even if it sounded vulgar. It was a simple and powerful word completely disregarding the Heavenly Evil Divine Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Eddie's face flashed with anger and quickly changed to greed. To Eddie, Luo Zheng was like a moving treasure trove.</p>

  <p>It had only been a few years, but this little brat had already gained so much power. If Eddie could kill him, he would obtain whatever power that belonged to him. That was all he wished— to destroy Luo Zheng and become invincible.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng! Do you dare to fight me now? I recall last time you ran away half across the Central Region for your life because you were too scared. Are you going to act like a coward this time too?" Eddie sneered at Luo Zheng. His body was covered in black Mu Ning.</p>

  <p>It was quite common for the leaders of both armies to challenge each other before a battle began.</p>

  <p>Even during a war among mortals, they would challenge each other. The leaders of both sides would fight and the morals of the victorious side would naturally rise, while the defeated side would have their morale plummet.</p>

  <p>Eddie was now challenging Luo Zheng to fight.</p>

  <p>After all, he was a warrior at the Life and Death Realm and he was considered the strongest in the Central Region. If he had to challenge someone, it should be Ning Yudie or the Ancient Tycoon of the World Commercial Alliance that held a higher status.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng was the one he wanted to challenge, fight and destroy.</p>

  <p>The Ancient Tycoon opened his eyes and gently floated up from his chair.</p>

  <p>He then shouted to Eddie in an extremely hoarse voice, "The great number one warrior of the Central Region is actually challenging a junior. You are crossing the line. How about I play with you for a bit?"</p>

  <p>Just like Luo Zheng and Eddie, the Ancient Tycoon's voice could be clearly heard by everyone across the Oracle City.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie also floated up and smiled at Eddie. "Eddie, I am the leader of Cloud Hall, yet you are challenging a mere disciple. Aren't you afraid of losing your face?"</p>

  <p>Eddie let out a cold snort. His eyes were like daggers as he glared at Luo Zheng and he asked, "Luo Zheng, do you dare?"</p>
