  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood not far away, holding his light green sword with an expressionless look on his face. He panted, staring at Edmond.</p>

  <p>The long sword he held was just an ordinary supreme primordial weapon and could not bear the energy of the Ways-blending Strike.</p>

  <p>As soon as he brandished the sword light, the entire blade became riddled with holes.</p>

  <p>When Yan and the Sword Clan's disciples attacked Edmond, the lightning cage that trapped Luo Zheng disappeared.</p>

  <p>However, he couldn't use the Ways-blending Strike continuously.</p>

  <p>He had already launched two strikes in a row against Atlas earlier, in order to save Yan.</p>

  <p>Both his body and Godly Tile had been pushed to the limit.</p>

  <p>The few hours of rest he got was far from enough for him to recover.</p>

  <p>His legs trembled in exhaustion.</p>

  <p>He was very much like the damaged sword he wielded.</p>

  <p>The energy he exerted after merging the Divine Dao was too powerful and could destroy all his meridians even if he merged it with the Truth of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"It's this strike. It's this strike..."</p>

  <p>Atlas hid far away and only looked at him from a distance.</p>

  <p>He had already learned his lesson from Luo Zheng's strike.</p>

  <p>Before, Atlas did not offer Edmond a hand because this strike had great influence on him. Moreover, he yielded to Edmond because he wasn't powerful enough.</p>

  <p>If this group of top-rank True Gods managed to miraculously kill Edmond then Atlas was willing to sit on the sidelines and wait for a chance to benefit from it.</p>

  <p>As a result, he tried his best to stay away.</p>

  <p>"This strike..."</p>

  <p>Duke had a stunned expression on his face.</p>

  <p>As the anonymous man, Luo Zheng's achievements in the Arena of Legends were truly amazing.</p>

  <p>His record of consecutive wins earned him quite the stellar reputation.</p>

  <p>A talent like him was rare even in the wealthy clans on the Floating Islands. Nobody could compare to Luo Zheng when it came to his achievement, not even the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>However, it was still going to be impossible for him to unleash such a terrifying sword strike.</p>

  <p>It wasn't reasonable.</p>

  <p>The strike just now was powerful enough to kill a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>They were also witnesses to how Yan directly attacked Edmond after forming a shadow.</p>

  <p>'What kind of powerful figures are these Luo siblings?' Duke couldn't help but wonder in his heart.</p>

  <p>No wonder both Troy and Rachelle were relentless in reminding him that Luo Zheng must never be underestimated.</p>

  <p>Duke had been initially indifferent. It was only now that he realized what they meant.</p>

  <p>Reinhard's face was red with excitement.</p>

  <p>"You should've seen this, Master Marsh," he murmured to himself.</p>

  <p>However, the ones most shocked about this turn of events were the two people that were on the top of the Sunrest Tree, the Holy Beings of the Sword Clan.</p>

  <p>The Sword Clan's greatest pursuit was the ultimate swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>In the entire divine land, it was the four Holy Beings of the Sword Clan that were considered the best in swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Gibson and Marsh were two of the four Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"That is... Emotion Closing Divine Dao?"</p>

  <p>Gibson's eyes flashed with a strong light.</p>

  <p>Witnessing the sword strike made them curious.</p>

  <p>"The Emotion Closing Divine Dao is extraordinary, but... it's impossible for it to be so powerful," Marsh murmured.</p>

  <p>There were many methods that affected the power of Luo Zheng's strike.</p>

  <p>In terms of cultivation base, he was only a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>His weapon was also only an ordinary supreme primordial weapon.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>The Emotion Closing Divine Dao was also powerful, but not to the extent they had just witnessed.</p>

  <p>The two old men could only look at Harold in shock.</p>

  <p>To their surprise, there was not much change in Harold's face.</p>

  <p>He already knew that the power of the Divine Dao could be integrated and also the fact that his master's Infinity Ruler was in Luo Zheng's possession.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had already been in the divine land for quite a significant amount of time and he believed it wouldn't be too difficult for him to learn how to wield the Infinity Ruler. But to Harold, Luo Zheng just should not have been able to merge the Divine Dao for the time being.</p>

  <p>The young man's performance surprised Harold immensely, however, he was more concerned about how the siblings could get past their current predicament.</p>

  <p>"That's the merging energy of the Divine Dao. It's literally hundreds of Divine Dao merged into one," Harold explained lightly.</p>

  <p>There was nothing else to hide. Besides, if they really got the inheritance, then the Sword Clan would completely side with the Luo Clan.</p>

  <p>"Hundreds of Divine Dao? He's comprehended so many?" Marsh asked, his eyes flashing with a strange luster.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng used different types of Divine Dao in the Time Sea Forbidden Land. It was extremely puzzling to me back then. I never expected him to actually be able to use hundreds of different types. Merging them must've been quite a task too," Gibson sighed.</p>

  <p>The divine land was always filled with extraordinary talents who cultivated two or three types of Divine Dao, however, merging them wasn't easy.</p>

  <p>In fact, only a few ever succeeded.</p>

  <p>They even had comprehended the theurgies beyond ways after merging the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>However, only a few True Gods had the qualifications to practice the merging of the Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>Both Gibson and Marsh knew this.</p>

  <p>Yet here was Luo Zheng who apparently merged hundreds of different kinds of Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Harold remarked. "I'm more concerned about whether they can leave the debate venue alive."</p>

  <p>He wasn't in the mood to discuss the complexities of merging Divine Dao. He simply widened his eyes and used his perception to watch everything in the debate venue. Energy continuously flowed in one of his hands as he calculated the possibilities.</p>

  <p>Edmond was suffering and was also one arm less because of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yan also showed great strength and the eleven disciples of Sword Clan could still be considered strong, however, the chance of winning against the enemy remained at zero.</p>

  <p>With his arm cut off, Edmond became silent.</p>

  <p>He grabbed his arm and docked it back to his shoulder. Countless flesh burst out from the wound and regenerated around the site.</p>

  <p>Countless red lightning also poured out from his body and wrapped around him.</p>

  <p>Edmond had a really bad temper but he had no energy to rage right now.</p>

  <p>He was silent and calm.</p>

  <p>There was no way he could regard this group as mere ants. It was time he treated them as serious opponents.</p>

  <p>Fizz! Fizz!</p>

  <p>Countless red lightning leaked out from his skin.</p>

  <p>He then took a step forward.</p>

  <p>The next second, he suddenly vanished.</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>Before he had a chance to react, Edmond already appeared above Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The fiend was wrapped in infinite red lightning and Luo Zheng felt as if the area around him was enveloped by an unattainable mountain.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>Edmond's eyes exuded a surging killing intent.</p>

  <p>He should've ended this boring game earlier.</p>
