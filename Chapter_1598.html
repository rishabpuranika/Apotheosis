<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1598 A Mysterious Sword (Part Two) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>When the Illusion Battlefield opened, the sword told Lone that the competition was crucial.</p>

  <p>In the Illusion Battlefield, Lone had encountered no resistance so far.</p>

  <p>The number of people in the entire universe who were truly capable of challenging him as an opponent was not high.</p>

  <p>After considering this, the young man before Lone seemed to be far cleverer, but he was still not powerful enough to contend Lone.</p>

  <p>However... the moment Luo Zheng regained his freedom in the darkness, three powerful round flames shot out from behind him.</p>

  <p>The warrior who had hooked Luo Zheng was impulsive, but that did not mean that he had not made sure that he would succeed. The moment he hooked Luo Zheng, he had made his move. The short spear in his hand went straight for Zheng's head. As soon as the spinning tip of the spear got near Luo Zheng, it was sure to impale him and crush his head.</p>

  <p>However, the warrior did not expect three fiery arrows to appear right behind Luo Zheng just as the latter was about to be stabbed by the spear.</p>

  <p>'Damn it!' the warrior cursed silently. At this moment, he did not care whether or not he could kill Luo Zheng. His figure flashed. He was about to escape out of sight.</p>

  <p>A faint smile appeared on Zheng's face as both of his hands shot out like lightning and took hold of the warrior. His hands were like iron hoops and firmly clamped on the warrior's body. Luo Zheng would not allow him to break free.</p>

  <p>"Die!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, Lone's black iron sword pierced through the darkness and headed straight for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>He did not need to think about how to attack Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The dark iron sword could handle almost everything by itself. It was his greatest source of reliance, and also like a part of him.</p>

  <p>Back then, when he had defeated the ace talent at the Blessed Buddha Land, he had not relied on his own strength. He had fully been dependent on the iron sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>The dark iron sword belonged to him, and in a sense, he too belonged to the sword.</p>

  <p>However, before the sword could arrive near its target, the three balls of flame exploded.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>The three flames burst into nothingness, creating dazzling light that one found hard to gaze at. Even the Dark Law was unable to restrain the light emitted by the flame. It seemed to want to devour the Dark Law.</p>

  <p>The martial artist that had activated the Dark Law stood close by, looking dejected. He was trying his level-best to maintain the Dark Law that he had set up.</p>

  <p>"Ah!!!"</p>

  <p>The other warriors ran away the moment the three balls of flame exploded. The ones captured burned to ashes in the flames.</p>

  <p>After all, the Moon Bursting Flame Bow was a supreme divine weapon and had a special Law of Causality exclusive to the fire element. How could a warrior of the Soul Sea Realm tolerate it?</p>

  <p>When Lone saw the blazing flames, the pupils of his eyes shrunk in fear.</p>

  <p>His first instinct was to retreat.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was only because of the sword that he had achieved so much.</p>

  <p>Strictly speaking, Lone's warrior spirit was not so strong, but that was unimportant. The sword was already a part of Lone and represented him.</p>

  <p>"Do not be afraid. What you're seeing is the sixth level of the Fire Law, the Fierce Flame Explosion. I can help you block it!"</p>

  <p>The dark iron sword sent a strand of its consciousness to Lone.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a golden beam of light shot out from within the dark sword. The light was transmitted from the sword hilt. The golden light turned Lone's arm golden too. It spread over to his shoulder, chest, and neck.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, he transformed into a radiant golden figure.</p>

  <p>The impact of the Fierce Flame Explosion was unable to harm Lone in the slightest.</p>

  <p>'Still, that boy has displayed quite a technique. Is he unafraid of the Fierce Flame Explosion himself? Would he not get hurt?'</p>

  <p>The dark iron sword was puzzled. It had no answer to this mystery.</p>

  <p>It was only after Lone and the sword had charged into the Fierce Flame Explosion that the dark iron sword was able to glean what had occurred.</p>

  <p>Just like Lone, Zheng's entire body was enveloped with a layer of golden light. The difference lay in the fact that the dense golden vortexes on Zheng's body seemed to rapidly be absorbing the flame that had broken out in the Fierce Flame Explosion.</p>

  <p>"This... this is..."</p>

  <p>As the dark iron sword observed the transformation in Zheng's body, the surprise it betrayed in its thoughts was not hidden from Lone.</p>

  <p>"What is this?"</p>

  <p>Lone asked with hesitation.</p>

  <p>Ever since he had established the connection with the dark iron sword, he had realized that everything in the universe was like child's play to the sword. It never regarded any of the Supreme Lords as being unbeatable, as if there was nothing in the universe worthy of its shock.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, when the black iron sword noticed the difference in Zheng's body, it expressed its astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Let's kill him first." The sword sent another message to Lone.</p>

  <p>"All right." By now, Lone had come very close to Luo Zheng. In fact, most techniques that the dark iron sword had taught Lone were movement techniques. The sword was an invincible existence. As long as Lone approached his opponent, he was able to leave the problem of attack to the sword without further worries.</p>

  <p>Lone suspected that if he were to ever get physically close to a Supreme Lord, the sword would be able to kill the Supreme Lord with a single jab.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The dark iron sword drew an arc in the air.</p>

  <p>It did not emit any kind of power. Only Lone himself knew just how terrible its action was.</p>

  <p>The young man before him was already a dead man.</p>

  <p>However, suddenly Luo Zheng smiled at Lone. He began to retreat and started to float over to the other side.</p>
