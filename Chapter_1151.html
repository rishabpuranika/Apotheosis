  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Feather Emperor Secret Land was actually named after a famous weapon refiner on this island. The entire Feather Emperor Island had been a place of mining and weapon refining in the past. This could be considered an arsenal of the Dragon Lineage Human.</p>

  <p>Back when the Dragon Lineage Human had been defeated, the members of the Dragon Lineage Human living on the Feather Emperor Island had been unable to destroy such a great number of weapons. But they didn't want them to fall into the hands of the humans, so they cast irreversible curses on the weapons.</p>

  <p>These curses could not be removed, and the weapons that had been cursed could not be used. So for these divine-level talents, they had become trash.</p>

  <p>But there were way too many of these weapons, ranging from low-grade mysterious weapons and spiritual weapons to fairy weapons and sacred weapons. And there were probably several million of them. But there were a few that had escaped the curses and stayed unaffected by them.</p>

  <p>If anyone could find sacred weapons that had been spared by the curses, it would definitely be a huge advantage and work for them at a profit.</p>

  <p>But it was highly improbable that one could find weapons that didn't have curses on them, which was why the divine-level talents referred to the process of searching for them as 'scavenging through garbage'.</p>

  <p>A section of the divine-level talents had given up mining and had instead gone to the arsenal to scavenge for weapons. However, a majority of the martial artists still thought that it would be more worthwhile to mine earnestly in the pyramid. But now that Luo Luo Zheng had brought the purple mineral-devouring bugs down to the lower floors, they didn't want to go into the pyramid. Mining might bring them some benefits, but no one was willing to lose their lives.</p>

  <p>"I see," Luo Luo Zheng said, nodding. He had no interest in picking up trash, so he decided to enter the pyramid.</p>

  <p>Callan and Fiona also decided not to pick up trash for the moment. Even Fredric, Bram, and the other crown princes of the divine kingdoms hadn't gone either. Given their status, even top-grade sacred weapons wouldn't pique their interest, aside from semi-divine and divine weapons.</p>

  <p>They chose to stay out of the pyramid to keep themselves from danger.</p>

  <p>The warriors who stayed all looked at Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't care what others thought of him. But he had attracted the purple mineral-devouring bugs down to the lower floors, which had scared Callan and Fiona out of the pyramid. Luo Luo Zheng then said to them, "If those purple mineral-devouring bugs return to the upper floors, I'll come out and inform you."</p>

  <p>Fiona wasn't very interested in mining and she had only entered the pyramid three times. Most of the time, she just sat in a corner and watched Luo Luo Zheng go in and out of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>Fiona wanted to advise Luo Luo Zheng against entering the pyramid, but after some thought, she decided not to say anything. Like Randy, she also knew that she couldn't dissuade Luo Luo Zheng from entering the pyramid.</p>

  <p>But Fredric, Bram, and several others became slightly happy at Luo Zheng's words. After all, there was still some time before the powerful masters of the Soul Sea Realm would personally come. Since they were unwilling to pick up trash, they naturally did not want to waste their valuable time doing nothing.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng climbed up the pyramid once he was done speaking. This time, he didn't choose to enter the fortieth floor. Instead, he climbed up to the forty-first floor and entered a narrow door.</p>

  <p>Once he had entered, Luo Luo Zheng did not encounter any purple mineral-devouring bugs. The mineral tree had a hundred thousand leaves growing out of it. Luo Luo Zheng assumed that he was at the top of the tree as he stood on the forty-first floor.</p>

  <p>There were a total of two hundred leaves on the forty-first floor, one hundred and fifty leaves on the forty-second floor. However, there were only one hundred on the forty-third floor and sixty leaves on the forty- fourth floor, ten leaves on the forty-fifth floor, six on the forty-sixth floor, and three on the forty-seventh floor.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng still didn't encounter any life stones on the forty-first floor and he didn't have any hope of finding any on this floor. After scanning the area, he walked to the edge of the leaf and searched for traces of the purple mineral-devouring bugs.</p>

  <p>'There's one on the left?'</p>

  <p>'There's one on a leaf of the forty-third floor?'</p>

  <p>'There are five over there, ' Luo Luo Zheng counted in his heart. Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as he saw that the five purple mineral-devouring bugs had returned to the fortieth floor, which meant that they had returned to the place they had previously been in.</p>

  <p>He let out a sigh of relief, jumped down, and entered the light circle at the bottom. He then told the warriors outside that the purple mineral-devouring bugs had returned to the fortieth floor. After that, he climbed up to the forty-second floor.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter that his chances of finding any life stones were slim. Luo Luo Zheng still scanned the area carefully and found what he already knew. There were no life stones on the leaves on the forty-second floor. He jumped down and entered the forty-third floor.</p>

  <p>He continued jumping and entering different floors. The forty-fourth floor...</p>

  <p>The forty-fifth floor?</p>

  <p>Callan had already entered the pyramid to start mining again. His talent might not be considered outstanding when compared to the other crown princes of the divine kingdoms, but he was definitely the most diligent one.</p>

  <p>Fiona sat in a corner of the pyramid and watched as Luo Luo Zheng entered and exited it.</p>

  <p>'Who is he collecting the life stones for?' Fiona thought. The corners of her mouth curled up slightly as her eyes flickered. She watched as Luo Luo Zheng entered the forty-fifth floor.</p>

  <p>Forty-fifth floor?</p>

  <p>Fiona blinked. Even though she didn't know anything about the Feather Emperor Secret Land before, she now knew that there was no need to enter the top three floors, from the forty-fifth to the forty-seventh floors.</p>

  <p>The leaves on these last three floors were unbreakable. For so many years, so many powerful masters of the divine kingdoms had used all sorts of methods to try and break them. None of them were able to dig out anything from the leaves of the 45th floor and above because there was no way for them to break the leaves.</p>

  <p>There were no life stones on the last three floors, and even if there were any, one could only anxiously stand aside and look longingly and helplessly at them.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was well aware of this fact. But he still chose to enter the forty-fifth floor, a place that was said to be impossible to excavate.</p>

  <p>The moment he entered the forty-fifth floor, Luo Luo Zheng smelled a faint fragrance.</p>

  <p>'It's so strange. I didn't smell this fragrance on the forty-fourth floor.</p>

  <p>Where does this fragrance come from?' Luo Luo Zheng wondered as a trace of doubt appeared across his face. He looked up to find six giant leaves above his head.</p>

  <p>And in the crack, Luo Luo Zheng saw three more leaves. The six giant leaves were at the forty-sixth floor and the three leaves were at the forty-seventh floor, which was the top of the pyramid.</p>

  <p>He saw that there was a flower among the three leaves.</p>

  <p>'The fragrance is coming from that flower! But this flower looks so different...' Luo Zheng's gaze flickered, surprise etched on his face.</p>

  <p>The flower was nothing like any normal flower he had ever seen. It looked more like a mineral. Its petals, pistils, and the root all seemed to be made up of various ores. So at first glance the flower seemed to have edges and corners.</p>

  <p>And because of this, this flower had the beauty of symmetry.</p>

  <p>After looking at it for a long while, Luo Luo Zheng moved his gaze away from it.</p>

  <p>Even though he was unwilling to walk away from its beauty, he could only sigh at the magic of the creator. He still had something important to do.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's eyes glistened with excitement as he looked down.</p>

  <p>"These... These are life stones?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Beneath Luo Zheng's feet were fourteen round stones, each the size of an egg.</p>

  <p>At the first glance, they looked very similar to the life stones.</p>

  <p>They were of the same size and the same color as the life stones. Luo Luo Zheng had excavated a lot of life stones before. They appeared in the shape of a circle every time and they always appeared in even numbers, like ten, twelve, or fourteen of them in a circle. A life stone should be a kind of fascicled material and would appear in a cluster every time.</p>

  <p>The ores before Luo Zheng's eyes were also in the form of a circle. But the surface of these ores was translucent. Luo Luo Zheng looked through the leaf and through the translucent outer shells of the ores. To his surprise, he found crystals floating inside them.</p>

  <p>'These also have life energy! And it's so rich and strong!' The more closely Luo Luo Zheng looked at them, the more he felt the power of the life energy.</p>

  <p>It didn't matter that Luo Luo Zheng was observing them through the thick leaf. He could still feel the full force of the life energy.</p>

  <p>Once a life stone was crushed, only a small amount of life energy could be released. They usually contained tiny amounts of life energy.</p>

  <p>However, the stones before him right now were different. Just a single one of them probably contained a thousand times more life energy than a life stone would normally have. That was to say, probably one such stone would be enough to completely restore Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>Seeing these small stones made Luo Luo Zheng appreciate the marvelous things that Creator had made. And at the same time, he became very excited.</p>

  <p>'One, I only want one of them! I'll be happy even if I can take just one of them out!' Luo Luo Zheng thought. His gaze was firmly locked on the stones on the ground beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>The problem was that the ten leaves on the forty-fifth floor, the six leaves on the forty-sixth floor, and the three leaves on the forty-seventh floor had never been broken by any one. Not even the most powerful masters at the Soul Sea Realm in the four divine kingdoms had been able to move them. The four divine kingdoms had probably tried to seek help from the human race in the Upper World through the Reverse Spirit Channel. But they still hadn't been able to deal with them.</p>

  <p>The brutal truth was that even though Luo Luo Zheng only wanted to take one of them, it would still be as difficult as reaching the heavens!</p>
