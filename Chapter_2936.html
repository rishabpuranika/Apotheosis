<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Being the master of the Murphy Universe, Murphy clearly knew everything about it.</p>

  <p>Zheng's sudden appearance didn't get unnoticed.</p>

  <p>However, Murphy decided to not say a word about it. Right now, he was not in the position to provoke someone as powerful as Zheng. Being a wise man, Murphy dared not to offend Zheng in any way.</p>

  <p>Despite Murphy's attempt to keep the peace, he didn't expect that Zheng would cross Maha's path. And without any warning, Maha actually dared to attack Zheng.</p>

  <p>Murphy didn't care whether or not Maha would live, but his fate was on Zheng's hand. He didn't want to be in big trouble because of Maha's irrational acts.</p>

  <p>"Holy... Holy Murphy!"</p>

  <p>Maha stammered, seeing Murphy.</p>

  <p>Everyone who followed behind Maha got surprised.</p>

  <p>As the creator of the world, Holy Murphy was the owner of the universe.</p>

  <p>He basically made all the things in the Murphy Universe! With that being said, even the strongest Grand Supreme Lord was no match for Holy Murphy. He could easily smash him during a fight.</p>

  <p>Most of the people in the Murphy Universe were not even aware of Holy Murphy's existence. A few people had a look of awe just by mentioning his name.</p>

  <p>"Holy Murphy! This man belongs to the Evolutionary Universe. He just snuck into the Murphy Universe," Maha commented immediately.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>Murphy shouted coldly, not wanting to hear another word.</p>

  <p>Under Murphy's extreme reprimand, Maha looked morose. However, he was not stupid enough to talk back.</p>

  <p>After scolding Maha, Murphy turned to Zheng and said, "If you want to travel through the Murphy Universe, please communicate with me. I will do my best to help you."</p>

  <p>"Does that mean I'll need to ask for your permission before I can enter the Murphy Universe?" Zheng asked flatly.</p>

  <p>Feeling the chill went down his spine, Murphy quickly replied, "No, that's not what I meant. You can travel the whole divine land freely. However, some people in this universe are still reckless and imprudent. Before you come here, I can wipe them out and make sure that you'll have a peaceful stay."</p>

  <p>Zheng indifferently glanced at Murphy. Knowing that Murphy couldn't escape, he decided to let his father deal with him. "I won't blame Maha this time," Zheng said in a cold tone.</p>

  <p>He then flew upwards.</p>

  <p>There was an invisible barrier under the green star, just on the top of the divine land. Currently, only Murphy could pass through it. This barrier separated all the living beings from the star.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng continuously flew upwards, Murphy hurriedly removed the invisible barrier.</p>

  <p>When Maha watched from where he was, Murphy and Zheng's conversation left him stiffened. He felt like he floated in the air and got struck by lightning.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe his ears.</p>

  <p>He was Holy Murphy! A Holy Being! Holy Murphy was known to be one of the most powerful in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Looking back two to three hundred years ago, Zheng was only a world lord.</p>

  <p>No matter how talented Zheng was, he could not believe that he would become so powerful and influential in that span of time. The time flow rate in the divine land was much slower than that in the universe. Even though Zheng entered the divine land just after the war, it had only been twenty to thirty years since he entered the divine land.</p>

  <p>Maha was confused as to how Zheng could be on a par with the Holy Being after only thirty years.</p>

  <p>Right now, it even seemed that Zheng was more superior to this Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Maha couldn't deny that he saw a trace of fear in Murphy's eyes just now.</p>

  <p>The recent discussion clearly represented how the weak bowed down to the superior.</p>

  <p>This guy...</p>

  <p>Maha was known as the young master, and no one in the Murphy Universe dared to provoke him. In fact, no one had surpassed him in terms of talent.</p>

  <p>His father had spent two hundred years in helping him with transformation.</p>

  <p>With Maha's great talent, there was no doubt he could step into the divine land in a short time.</p>

  <p>However, he got defeated and killed during the universe war, which was the greatest pity in his life. Since then, he had made countless promises to take revenge on Zheng one day.</p>

  <p>Therefore, when he saw Zheng again, hatred immediately rose in his heart.</p>

  <p>But seeing Murphy's attitude made him realize how different he was from Zheng.</p>

  <p>He completely believed that even if Zheng killed him in front of Murphy, Murphy would keep his lips sealed.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Maha was as light as floating dust in his eyes, Zheng decided not to make a move.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the fact that Zheng didn't bother to kill him became a greatest contempt, making Maha feel disappointed and depressed.</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng wouldn't guess Maha's feelings. Such a fellow was indeed not qualified to distract him. Soon after passing over the green star, Zheng finally arrived at the top of the universe.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the top of the divine land, after the Slaughtering Moonlight Array was activated, the Yellow Emperor Guards took an absolute upper position. The Holy Beings, including Marsh, Moon and Vanessa, were killed.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Yellow Emperor Guards weren't aware that the Holy Beings could be reborn in their Rebirth Lands. That diminished any danger in the Holy Beings' lives.</p>

  <p>With Emily and Timotheus standing in front, the rest of the people gathered together. Both warriors were wounded, and Emily even lost an arm.</p>

  <p>If only Clement relied on his own strength, Emily and Timotheus could defeat him when they united. However, after making use of the Slaughtering Moonlight Array, Clement became much more powerful and terrifying.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Ramzi was proficient in the array.</p>

  <p>He also arranged a small array that covered everyone inside during that moment.</p>

  <p>He called it the Image Disrupting Array, which could disrupt the Slaughtering Moonlight Array to a certain extent.</p>

  <p>Known to be much more powerful and magical than Ramzi's Image Disrupting Array, the Slaughtering Moonlight Array was driven with the divine crystals. Ramzi's array could only disturb the Slaughtering Moonlight Array's power at a critical moment, but it couldn't break the array.</p>

  <p>"I have plenty of time to deal with you. I'll wait and see how long you can hold on," Clement said casually, clenching the blood sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As the blood sword trembled on Clement's shaking hand, a layer of silver frost covered its surface.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Seeing what happened, Ramzi patted the yellow paper again. The paper burned and spread out along the Image Disrupting Array, causing the moons floating in the sky to be in disorder again.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the silver moonlight on Clement's blood sword deflected and fell into the void.</p>

  <p>With the Slaughtering Moonlight Array in a chaotic state, Clement also had difficulty in controlling its power. It was precisely the same reason how Emily and Timotheus were able to hold on.</p>

  <p>However, resisting the Slaughtering Moonlight Array by means of one array was extremely difficult.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Slaughtering Moonlight Array relied on the divine crystals to continuously release its power. As for Ramzi, he managed to hold on using his own strength. During these few days, he didn't even get a chance to close his eyes. His face reflected how lethargic and exhausted he had been.</p>

  <p>Of course, being aware of that, Clement didn't worry at all.</p>

  <p>He knew that before the Slaughtering Moonlight Array used up all the divine crystals, the Image Disrupting Array would definitely collapse. He only needed to constantly give enough pressure.</p>

  <p>Therefore, while using the array, he also ordered the other Yellow Emperor Guards to continue in breaking the space barrier which led to the divine land.</p>

  <p>With the combined power of the sword and the Slaughtering Moonlight Array, he became powerful enough to trap and kill everyone before him.</p>
