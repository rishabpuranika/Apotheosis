<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>For the past few days, Luo Zheng had been in deep thought.</p>

  <p>He didn't know much about Supreme Lord Sword, other than he was the owner of the Killing Sword Mountain.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was still a nature creature, he had once stepped into the Killing Sword Mountain after comprehending the consummate sword intent. Now, he finally realized that the sword stabbed into the summit of the Killing Sword Mountain might belong to Supreme Lord Sword, and that it was also the white sword shadow in front of the huge stone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wondered if one had to use the sword of Supreme Lord Sword to perform the Gods-intimidating Strike.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng immediately rejected this thought. The Gods-intimidating Strike required a type of comprehension that matched that of a divinity. And those who could not display the strike perfectly were probably not in their right state of mind.</p>

  <p>If a warrior had completely comprehended the sword strike, then he would be able to unleash a terrifying power even if holding a blade made of grass in his hand. It was true that the two-foot sword of Supreme Lord Sword was a powerful treasure but, in the end, it could only be used to help a warrior perform the Gods-intimidating Strike better.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng couldn't stop thinking about these things. As for Freya, she had already packed up her stuff and planned to set off on their journey.</p>

  <p>"Right now, we are in the Spiritual Force Sacred Place," Freya said as she poured her life vitality into a jade slip. In an instant, a giant map appeared around the two of them.</p>

  <p>This jade slip contained a two-star divine texture and was able to draw a map within it. This display of the map was both intuitive and convenient.</p>

  <p>On this map, Freya carefully marked their current location, which was also the location of the Void Flower Hall.</p>

  <p>"I've already learned about the entire Spirit Reading World and found out the location of the Dark World. We can pass through this space channel to get to the supreme world channel, so that we can get there faster.</p>

  <p>Then, we can travel all the way north to the trans-border channel..."</p>

  <p>Freya said seriously, "Strictly speaking, the Dark World isn't the territory of the alliance. In fact, although the Supreme World is very close to the alliance, there are still many living creatures of all kinds and races gathered there. Besides the human beings, there are other powerful races, including the Demon Night and the Ogres..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt taken aback with Freya's words.</p>

  <p>"Did you collect all this information in the past few days?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Freya nodded, and then replied, "It's not difficult to get information about these matters in the Void Flower Hall. I just asked around."</p>

  <p>She didn't know anything about these matters before. She didn't even know about which supreme worlds were next to the Spirit Reading World nor how many tenth-grade sacred places the Spirit Reading World had.</p>

  <p>However, after Luo Zheng agreed to let her join him, she started to get prepared.</p>

  <p>It might have been difficult to gather information from any other city, but that was not the case in the Void Flower Hall.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was now starting to realize what a great idea it had been to agree to Freya joining him.</p>

  <p>Freya really took this matter seriously. She tried her best to obtain the related information and meticulously prepared for everything.</p>

  <p>After everything was prepared, Luo Zheng bid farewell to Master Shen.</p>

  <p>As the Heavenly Phoenix Horse let out a loud screech, it carried Luo Zheng and Freya straight into the sky. Soon after, the two of them turned into a transmission channel and headed straight for the supreme world channel.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Phoenix Horse moved faster and faster and it was capable of traveling a long distance. The time it took to cross a supreme world was longer than they imagined.</p>

  <p>Not long after, the two of them passed through a supreme world and decided to leave the transmission channel. They once again unfolded the map and compared it with their own position. The location that Lincoln had indicated seemed to be in the center of the Dark World.</p>

  <p>As Zheng's finger pointed towards that place, Freya immediately said, "In the center of the Dark World, there is a large city called Auspice City.</p>

  <p>This is a city of trade, also known as the Hundred Races City because many races have established agencies here to trade with each other. The city is famous in the alliance and there are many living creatures from over a hundred races."</p>

  <p>It seemed that Freya was reciting every single word of the information she had gathered. Even though memorizing things was a basic skill for a warrior, with Freya's preparation being so thorough, it still made Luo Zheng a little stunned and surprised.</p>

  <p>"The three most famous auction houses are controlled by the three great races." Noticing that Luo Zheng was staring at her, Freya stopped talking. She stuck out her tongue in embarrassment and said, "Let's get moving!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded, feeling a bit confused.</p>

  <p>He always assumed that the secret treasures of the Dark World would be at a deserted, remote place. However, now they were heading for a bustling city of trade. Why had Lincoln asked Luo Zheng to go there?</p>

  <p>Perhaps he was hoping to meet him there.</p>

  <p>No matter what, Luo Zheng decided to make his way to the Auspice City first.</p>

  <p>After traveling through the supreme world channel, they had finally reached their destination, the Auspice City, which was also known as the Hundred Races City.</p>

  <p>Just as they left the transmission channel, several mountain-like living creatures appeared in front of them. They were tall and sturdy ogre warriors.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng knew the ogre warriors quite well. When he stayed on the Sea God Continent, Luo Zheng had fought this race many times.</p>

  <p>The ogre was a very aggressive race. Even in the Upper World, they had become enemies of many other races. Their relationship with the human race was not good, and the two races would even fight disputes sometimes.</p>

  <p>However, the situation in the Upper World was a bit more complicated.</p>

  <p>Not only did the human beings have an alliance, but there were also two other major human forces. The ogres were also divided into several forces and the relationship among the forces was very complicated.</p>

  <p>Although there was some friction between the races, Luo Zheng did not feel any enmity within this trade city.</p>

  <p>This wasn't the Sea God Continent after all. On that chaotic continent, all the races were fighting for the right to survive and trying their best to suppress their opponents.</p>

  <p>The Dark World was originally very complicated, being a supreme world that contained so many races. But now, the purpose of everyone staying there was just to do business. They emphasized on making money through peaceful means, and there was no need for them to fight other races for no reason.</p>

  <p>Life didn't go as peacefully in other supreme worlds. For example, right now, human beings and ogres were fighting each other in other supreme worlds, killing each other to death.</p>

  <p>After entering the Auspice City, Luo Zheng forcefully stuffed the Heavenly Phoenix Horse into the spirit beast bag.</p>

  <p>This was no longer human's territory, so he had to be more careful. Even when he was on a territory belonging to the human race, there was someone like Julian who had still tried to kill him and take away his Heavenly Phoenix Horse. If he were to ride the Heavenly Phoenix Horse through the city, it would be too ostentatious and gather unwanted attention.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng and Freya were travelling through Auspice City and moving towards the place that Lincoln designated.</p>

  <p>Just like the Holy City of the Spiritual Force Sacred Place, many lines formed by the divine texture were also carved into the sky. All living beings flew along those lines in an orderly manner.</p>

  <p>After travelling for an hour, Luo Zheng and Freya landed on the ground.</p>

  <p>At this moment, a grand and imposing building appeared in front of them. It was a large circular building supported by hundreds of huge stone pillars. A special circular rune was drawn in front of the building.</p>

  <p>In front of this building, there were a lot of warriors going in and out.</p>

  <p>Most of them were human warriors.</p>

  <p>"What... place is this?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Freya got flustered as she heard Zheng's question. Although she had a thorough understanding of the Dark World, it was impossible for her to understand everything about it in such a short amount of time. Moreover, this was only a single building in one of the large cities. There might be over one hundred large cities in the Dark World.</p>

  <p>Noticing Freya's panic, Luo Zheng couldn't help but laugh. Freya was serious all the time and even though being serious was a virtue, there was no need to take his question so seriously. He was only asking casually.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. I'll go ask around and figure out what it is," Luo Zheng said with a smile.</p>

  <p>Freya shook her head and uttered, "I will go then..."</p>

  <p>However, at this time, a warrior wearing a long white robe walked up to them and said to Luo Zheng, "Hey, if you want to enter, I can show you in!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was immediately curious but Freya asked, "What is this place?"</p>

  <p>The warrior spoke proudly, "This is the Luster Force Secret Sect. Have you heard about it?"</p>

  <p>"Secret sect?" Zheng's eyes suddenly flashed as he remembered the Holy Maiden of the Divine Kingdom Continent.</p>
