<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>At that moment, Gerald quickly turned into an oval cocoon to protect himself from the Element Destruction.</p>

  <p>The Element Destruction then hit the cocoon, which became charred and carbonized.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the Element Destruction stopped. The charred part of the cocoon cracked then a pinkish tender body came out of it. The body immediately stiffened and turned into a shiny black shell upon coming out.</p>

  <p>It looked like Gerald had recovered to normal, but in reality, he had exhausted all of his strength. He was already quite weak.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, the Grandmaster of Heaven, who was nearby, looked a lot better than Gerald. He was unharmed since he relied on a few magic treasures to protect himself, but he still had to maintain the Heart-piercing Lock to restrain Othniel.</p>

  <p>The amount of energy used by the Heart-piercing Lock was not significant, but the Grandmaster of Heaven had consumed a large amount of energy to resist the Element Destruction. Thus, it wasn't easy to maintain the Heart-piercing Lock as it was before.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the Grandmaster of Heaven's overall situation wasn't actually much better than Gerald's.</p>

  <p>Far away from them, after the Snake Goddess withdrew the blood-red enchanted barrier, she and Fuxi slowly appeared behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>Fuxi took a deep breath, but his eyes still twitched.</p>

  <p>The energy he released when he used the marks of Eight Diagrams was the strongest kind of power in the Source World. Furthermore, he thought that since he had gone to numerous battles in the Three Purities Stage, there was nothing to fear.</p>

  <p>But he was utterly shocked when the Element Destruction happened.</p>

  <p>The Element Destruction didn't affect a large area, and only half of the province got hit, but the force that struck the province was far beyond what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>Was that how powerful that member from the Element Spirit race was?</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" the Snake Goddess shouted.</p>

  <p>She looked at the distance and quickly pulled Fuxi while she activated the Grand Teleportation. After she opened a space channel, the two of them went inside.</p>

  <p>A smile graced the Grandmaster of Heaven's face when he saw them escape hurriedly. Then, he followed them.</p>

  <p>Claire, who was the most troublesome to deal with, was gone, and Gerald was already weak. The Snake Goddess and Fuxi were just like mice.</p>

  <p>Everything would be under his control.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The moment the Grandmaster of Heaven moved, Gerald's tail suddenly stabbed him. The tail's poisonous needle glowed with a cyan light, which was another kind of deadly poison.</p>

  <p>In turn, the Grandmaster of Heaven abruptly turned around and revealed a mocking smile. At the same time, a cyan ray of light flashed and hit Gerald's tail.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Once again, the cyan light sliced Gerald's tail.</p>

  <p>As soon as his tail fell off, black flames engulfed his body.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to kill a Chaos Ancient God, especially if it was someone like Gerald, who had unparalleled life energy.</p>

  <p>Still, the black flames that enveloped him were enough to restrain him for a while.</p>

  <p>Since Gerald couldn't escape, he had no choice but to produce more body tissues to isolate the uncontrollable black flames from his body. It was indeed impossible for him to chase after the Grandmaster of Heaven in this situation.</p>

  <p>In the end, the Grandmaster of Heaven successfully went into the space channel and chased the Snake Goddess and Fuxi.</p>

  <p>On the boundary wall not far away, the Evil God's body took shape once more.</p>

  <p>The spear and body he had previously condensed with the boundary wall had long since disappeared in the Element Destruction. Moreover, he felt quite regretful when he saw Fuxi have taken Zheng away and left the Separate Amber Province.</p>

  <p>For him, it would be best if the warriors killed each other in the Element Destruction, then that was when he would finally show up and devour everyone else? including the Grandmaster of Heaven!</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, things didn't turn out the way he planned. Now, even Zheng had run away.</p>

  <p>He wasn't sure if the Grandmaster of Heaven would have any issues if he devoured Zheng. If the Grandmaster of Heaven caught Zheng, he probably wouldn't hand Zheng over.</p>

  <p>What was worse for him was that his power only worked within the Separate Amber Province. If he went beyond the boundary wall, the body formed by the boundary wall would collapse. Thus, he could not follow them.</p>

  <p>In the darkness, Zheng saw more and more mountain-like light dots, which continued to get closer to him.</p>

  <p>At first, the light dots lined up in an almost random way. As they increased, however, he gradually discovered that the light dots seemed to convey some sort of information.</p>

  <p>There was a kind of violent energy inside the light dot nearest to him. When his consciousness touched the light dot, he felt an intense burning sensation, as if there was fire trapped inside it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the light dot on the far left felt extremely cold. He would be frozen if he approached it.</p>

  <p>The energy inside the light dots was quite pure and primitive. It was so pure that it didn't seem to be energy at all, but rather a creature.</p>

  <p>Since he got trapped in the darkness, the light dots continuously increased at random speeds. Sometimes it was fast, and sometimes it was slow. They also increased by varying numbers, as sometimes only a few new ones came up, sometimes it was a dozen. Most incredibly, nearly more than a hundred new light dots appeared not long ago.</p>

  <p>He couldn't figure out the rules at first, but as the number of light dots increased, the rules got revealed.</p>

  <p>Some of the light dots contained the power of space and time. The other light dots that were connected to them had the same attributes and were arranged in an orderly fashion.</p>

  <p>There was a gap between the light dots that were together. He guessed it was because there were other light dots with a similar energy that hadn't lit up.</p>

  <p>Would he only get to leave this dark space when all the light dots had lit up?</p>

  <p>He could only wonder.</p>

  <p>But how did the light dots light up anyway?</p>

  <p>Did it all depend on luck, or was there a pattern he had yet to comprehend?</p>

  <p>He couldn't do anything after he entered this dark space, except to wait quietly.</p>

  <p>In the Eternal Divine Courtyard, the four bronze statues began to discuss intensely after a moment of silence.</p>

  <p>"There are already one hundred and eighty-six light columns that have lit up. Do you remember the legend that once spread in the Eternal Divine Courtyard?" the bronze bird asked the bronze monkey.</p>

  <p>"When the number of light columns that have lit up is more than half of the total number, the ancestry-level bloodline would automatically become complete?" "Yes, I remember!</p>

  <p>There was indeed such a legend! I just thought that such a thing couldn't possibly happen at that time. I simply thought it was a story," the bronze human said excitedly. The other bronze statues also became ecstatic when the bronze bird asked the question.</p>

  <p>At that time, only a few creatures were qualified to enter the sacred cup.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, even fewer of them could light up a dozen light columns in the map.</p>

  <p>If half of the light columns or one hundred and eighty-seven light columns to be exact have lit up, then the remaining light columns would automatically rise to complete the bloodline map.</p>

  <p>Now with one more column to light up, the number would reach half.</p>

  <p>What if the legend was true?</p>

  <p>How strong would the ancestry-level bloodline be in its complete state?</p>

  <p>The four bronze statues all had the same thought. If they could see it with their own eyes, then it would be worth even if they would end up dead.</p>

  <p>At that point, Fuxi and the Snake Goddess were still running like mad in the space channel while they carried Zheng.</p>

  <p>Although the Snake Goddess had condensed the Cloud Light Sail again, it took some time for the sail to speed up. During that period, the Grandmaster of Heaven had already caught up with them.</p>
