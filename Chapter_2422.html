<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The vicious vines attacked all the True Gods, including Zheng.</p>

  <p>The vines attacked like nimble snakes, wreathing and slithering towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!".</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't fly and escape like the top-rank True Gods, so he could rely only on his agile body to keep away from them.</p>

  <p>Seeing the vines approach him rapidly, he twisted himself and shot towards the side of the cave.</p>

  <p>But the vines seemed to have eyes as they quickly changed their direction and followed Zheng. They twisted and overlapped with each other to form a net and completely block Zheng's escape.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>At the same time, another seven or eight vines extended from the ground below and obstructed Zheng's exit from all sides.</p>

  <p>"Like I said, low-rank True Gods such as yourself, come here looking for death," sneered the dark-skinned man as he floated above.</p>

  <p>In the Killing Zone, there was no restraint and the top-rank True Gods naturally had a better advantage.</p>

  <p>Their strength was not only far greater than that of the average mid-rank and low-rank True Gods, but they could even fly freely.</p>

  <p>That was why, in the second round of screening, almost ninety percent of the candidates were top-rank True Gods and a very meagre number formed the mid-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>Zheng was the only low-rank True God among them. Everyone was already astounded to witness this.</p>

  <p>Zheng barely flinched even after hearing the man's words. With a single tap of his toe, he transformed into a sharp arrow and shot forward.</p>

  <p>"Why throw yourself into the net so soon? Losing already?"</p>

  <p>The man smirked, as he thought that Zheng had given up.</p>

  <p>The vines, as the spiritual roots of the Sunrest Tree, were impossible to destroy. From what the man witnessed in the many debates that he took part in, those who were trapped by the vines were all knocked out, and were powerless to cut the vines by themselves.</p>

  <p>Sometime back, a True God who was trapped by these vines did not crumb the Sword Card to seek the help of the Sword Clan. In the end, he was strangled to death by the vines!</p>

  <p>Therefore, once the True Gods were trapped by the vines, they would immediately crumb their Sword Cards and quit the second round of screening. That was the only way to escape one's death.</p>

  <p>There would be other chances to take part in the debate over the Godly Ways, but they had only one life. One's life was more important than winning rounds.</p>

  <p>The moment the net made of the vines engulfed Zheng, his figure suddenly became blurry. At the same time, a unique aura was spreading out of his body.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Then the dark-skinned man saw Zheng's body suddenly become formless. His body transformed into a blob of mass and oozed out through the gaps!</p>

  <p>After the entire mass seeped out, Zheng's body returned back to normal. He turned and looked at the man hovering above, with a smile. Once again he tapped his toe, and altering into light, shot towards the depths of the Killing Zone.</p>

  <p>"What's this technique? I have never seen it performed by a low-rank True God!" The man's eyes widened.</p>

  <p>The other top-rank True Gods around saw this scene and were completely appalled at the sight.</p>

  <p>"Looks like some kind of soft body technique of a certain clan," a top-rank True God said.</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, the soft body technique can definitely soften the body and transform it into various shapes. But it takes tremendous time to prepare, so it's impossible for anyone to do so as soon as he wishes," another top-rank True God said with a strange expression. "Maybe he has cultivated some theurgy beyond way."</p>

  <p>At that moment, they could clearly sense a special aura emanating from Zheng.</p>

  <p>It was the aura emitted by the Truth of Cultivation Nature, but they couldn't tell what it was with their limited experience and knowledge.</p>

  <p>The dark-skinned man continued to stare at Zheng with cool eyes. Affected by the atmosphere in the Killing Zone, he had an extremely strong urge to kill.</p>

  <p>However, he was well aware of the rules of the Sword Clan. Bill had already warned them that if they fought here, the consequences could be severe.</p>

  <p>If he had the chance, he would definitely kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>With this thought, the dark-skinned man followed Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>As soon as Zheng landed on the ground, countless vines would spring around him.</p>

  <p>He tapped the ground lightly with his toe, and once again, he transformed into a beam of light and jumped out.</p>

  <p>As he leaped in this way, his speed was faster than those of the top-rank True Gods flying in the air.</p>

  <p>Some top-rank True Gods were accidentally trapped by the vines. They immediately broke their Sword Cards and gave up.</p>

  <p>About a thousand True Gods were eliminated in the first stage. Only half the members were left now.</p>

  <p>"This level is not so difficult after all." Zheng sprinted forward as he could feel his killing intent.</p>

  <p>The killing aura that Zheng had used in the universe was an external object. It was formed from the most resentful curses of the dying souls.</p>

  <p>The Murdering Godly Way was just a simple thought or intent about murder.</p>

  <p>However, the aura in this Killing Zone could force the living beings to form an irresistible killing intention.</p>

  <p>For example, Zheng considered these vines as very annoying. He knew clearly that he could not destroy the vines that spread out from the Sunrest Tree, but he still had an impulse to slash off those vines.</p>

  <p>'No combat vs. killing. The Truth of Godly Way of the Sunrest Tree Region has such extreme sides.'</p>

  <p>Just as Zheng was thinking about it, he heard the crackling ahead.</p>

  <p>"Rumble..."</p>

  <p>"Hurry up! Watch out for these bugs!"</p>

  <p>Zheng had already easily passed through the area full of vines.</p>

  <p>But the path ahead was even more dangerous.</p>

  <p>Vines were no longer sprouting out from both sides of the large hole.</p>

  <p>Instead on the wall, there were many round holes of different sizes.</p>

  <p>As the True Gods rushed into this area, black beetles started emerging from the holes.</p>

  <p>The black beetles were covered with an outer layer of thick black shell, and a pair of sharp pincers like tentacles atop their heads. They were about the same size as ordinary adults and they even looked harmless.</p>

  <p>However, under the aura of the Killing Zone, thousands pairs of compound eyes emitted bright red lights and charged towards the numerous True Gods.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>Not far ahead of Zheng, a top-rank True God was covered in a layer of lightning.</p>

  <p>This top-rank True God was practicing the Thunderstorm Godly Way. His body was covered by numerous beams of thunderstorms. With his hair standing up, he looked like an angry god of thunder.</p>

  <p>The lightning snakes rushed towards the black beetles one after another and exploded on their shells.</p>

  <p>However, these beetles seemed to be completely unharmed by the lightning effect. Instead, they spread out their wings, turned into black lights, and rushed towards the top-rank True God at an alarming speed!</p>

  <p>"Swish! Swish! Swish!"</p>

  <p>Even though that top-rank True God had transformed into lightening and moved extremely fast, he still couldn't escape from the attacks of the dozens of black beetles as they swarmed up.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Through their tentacles, they jabbed into the body of that top-rank True God and pinned him to one side of the tree hole.</p>

  <p>In a moment of desperation, the True God broke the Sword Card in his hand.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was because those black beetles were very dangerous, the reaction of the Sword Clan was extremely fast. Suddenly a gap appeared at the top of wall. A light from outside the tree hole quietly shone on the True God.</p>

  <p>All of the black beetles had been very aggressive a moment ago and wanted to kill the True God, but now they simply walked away from him.</p>
