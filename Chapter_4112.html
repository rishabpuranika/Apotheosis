<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had spent a lot of time working on the Lone Sword. He was a little depressed about this unsatisfactory result.</p>

  <p>After finishing speaking, Luo Nian pulled out the black stone from the page.</p>

  <p>The page also had a row of square holes embedded in it. Luo Nian found the innermost hole and integrated the black stone into it.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As the two parts assembled, a ray of red light blazed from it, traveling a distance towards the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>When the red light reached and established a link to it, a faint blue light suddenly flashed on its surface.</p>

  <p>The surface of the sword began to produce a chill.</p>

  <p>The chill spread at an incredible speed, and before the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord could react, a thick layer of ice had already covered the inner wall of the Mysterious Yellow Tower.</p>

  <p>Splash, splash, splash...</p>

  <p>Out of thin air, ice statues started to appear.</p>

  <p>The statues shook as they struggled to grow from the ice wall, and then they stood still, like soldiers on duty.</p>

  <p>Their stance radiated a very powerful aura.</p>

  <p>"The ability of the Lone Sword has changed..." the young man in the cyan robe said stiffly.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord also took a deep breath, as the cold aura also caused his body to chill.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the shivers down his spine, he stared at the Lone Sword and said, "The attribute of the Lone Sword has really been changed... How did you do it?"</p>

  <p>"It's very simple. Just change the black stone's position," Luo Nian replied.</p>

  <p>"Can it be moved to a higher page or even the top?" wondered the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>"I can have a try," replied Luo Nian.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord seemed to have gotten the idea as his face lit up with excitement. His hands trembled slightly as he waited on Luo Nian's move.</p>

  <p>The young man in the cyan robe observed his master and sighed with contentment. This old man had not acted like this for many years.</p>

  <p>The small black stone was portable and could be easily carried by Luo Nian. If he encountered something uncertain, he could place it into a page nearby. This way, he could ask the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord at any time. It was killing two birds with one stone.</p>

  <p>When Luo Nian pulled the small black stone away, the cold air from the Lone Sword immediately stopped blowing. The ice wall within the Mysterious Yellow Tower had also cracked quickly.</p>

  <p>However, the rows of ice statues in front did not disappear. They revealed their consciousness after being separated from the Lone Sword and expressed intent of hostility towards the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord.</p>

  <p>Before they could make a move, the young man in the cyan robe had already rushed over like a gust of wind.</p>

  <p>He had dashed across without any sign of making a move.</p>

  <p>When he stopped at the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord's side, the row of ice statues melted into a pool of water.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian started to climb up the steps again and saw a few more red light rays.</p>

  <p>Some of these red light rays were connected to the Supreme Pure Realm, and some were connected to the Jade Pure Realm. However, more red light rays were connected to the inner worlds.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian got closer to reach the top. He didn't bother to observe the red light rays leading to inner worlds and paid more attention to the Other Shore Tokens in the Jade Pure Realm and the Supreme Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the journey, Luo Nian stopped to communicate with the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord and asked about his father's situation. He wanted to find Luo Zheng through the red light rays.</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord had easily observed the Source World before, but his Celestial Eye had not been repaired after being broken by the Evil God's punch. He could only guess roughly and told Luo Nian that Luo Zheng was now in the Li Shan mountain and had entered the Supreme Pure Realm of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Pure Realm and the Jade Pure Realm were both large.</p>

  <p>Finding Luo Zheng through just a few Other Shore Tokens was already like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p>

  <p>After trying to find him through dozens of red light rays, Luo Nian gave up and proceeded to move towards the top of the pillar.</p>

  <p>Four hours later, Luo Nian stopped again.</p>

  <p>He was only ten page stairs from the top now.</p>

  <p>The ten stairs had become very thick and each of them was ten feet high!</p>

  <p>The red light had disappeared and was replaced by black light.</p>

  <p>"Well, this energy is sickening..."</p>

  <p>When Luo Nian fixed his eyes on the black light, he was feeling dizzy.</p>

  <p>What kind of Other Shore Tokens were these black light rays connected to?</p>

  <p>Out of caution, Luo Nian didn't dare to get close to the black light.</p>

  <p>Instead, he inserted the small black stone into the eleventh stair, and a red light ray once again connected to the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>The eleventh stair had the strongest energy among the red light rays. The Lone Sword flickered like blazing flames, and even the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord took a few steps back.</p>

  <p>Luo Nian immediately told the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord what he had seen. "The last ten stairs seem to have much stronger energy with these black light rays!"</p>

  <p>The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord was not surprised at his statement. "The Other Shore Tokens connected to the last ten stairs are in the hands of the Snake Spirit King," he answered.</p>

  <p>The young man in the cyan robe was neither surprised. He had previously heard it from his master.</p>

  <p>The power of the Four Spirits Sect did not only come from the ancestry-level bloodline but also the four holy pillars.</p>

  <p>The snake spirits, the bird spirits, the human spirits, and the monkey spirits each controlled a holy pillar.</p>

  <p>In the past, the holy pillars gave energy to the people of the Four Spirits Sect, but not too much to the secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>The four holy pillars shined with dense vivid lights all year round, including the orange light and red light.</p>

  <p>These rays of light passed through infinite space and connected with the Other Shore Tokens uniquely, giving the Four Spirits Sect more power.</p>

  <p>The power of the ancestry-level bloodline had been very strong, but it was still limited.</p>

  <p>Because of the four holy pillars, the Other Shore Tokens had changing abilities derived from the ancestry-level bloodline, and the threshold of them was lower compared to that of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>The energy of the four holy pillars came from the energy pools? the secondary worlds that spread over the main world.</p>

  <p>As the energy absorbed by the four holy pillars increased, the power of the Other Shore Tokens also increased. The power of the Other Shore Tokens on the highest pages of the pillars was even stronger than that of the origin-level bloodlines.</p>

  <p>Those who were qualified to merge with the Other Shore Tokens on the highest pages of the pillars were top masters from the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the four sects also controlled the Other Shore Tokens of the last ten stairs.</p>

  <p>"The holy pillar you are climbing belongs to the Snake Spirit Sect, and the strongest ten Other Shore Tokens are probably kept by the Snake Spirit King. It is said that these ten Other Shore Tokens control nearly one-third of the energy of the holy pillar," the Grand Supreme Elderly Lord spoke.</p>

  <p>"One-third..." Luo Nian's eyes widened. "Then, isn't the Snake Spirit King able to destroy the chaos in an instant?"</p>

  <p>He concluded that the energy in the holy pillar was too strong...</p>

  <p>The chaos was no match for the holy pillar.</p>

  <p>"No." The Grand Supreme Elderly Lord shook his head. "The energy pools are almost destroyed and the power of the Other Shore Tokens is much weaker than before. On the other hand, the chaos is a very special world?a trap carefully set up by the Snake Spirit King. It is far stronger than the ordinary secondary worlds."</p>

  <p>In the main world, the Monkey Spirit King was almost invincible. The Snake Spirit King was nothing compared to him, and both the Human Spirit King and the Bird Spirit King appeared to have no advantage against him.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit King had surprisingly pulled the other three kings into a lower-level world. This was the reason why the Snake Spirit King had been able to kill them back then.</p>
