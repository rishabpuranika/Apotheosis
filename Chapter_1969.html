  <p>
</p>

  <p>Master Feng did not reply. The golden glow between his eyebrows shone brighter and brighter, like a shining star.</p>

  <p>Master Feng was about to use his Heavenly Destiny. When the Supreme Lords saw this, they thought it was ridiculous. However, they knew it was useless to try to persuade him otherwise. They had no choice but to stand by and do as he pleased...</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sky appeared behind Luo Luo Zheng in a flash. He smiled at Ning Yudie and Freya, and commanded, "Please leave us for the time being..."</p>

  <p>As he uttered those words, a triangular enchanted barrier appeared in his hands, imprisoning Ning Yudie and Freya within it in an instant.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie looked at the Mu Ning emitting from Master Feng's body and asked worriedly, "Will my husband be fine?"</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. Master Feng definitely knows how to deal with him,"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Sky said with a smile.</p>

  <p>In fact, even Supreme Lord Sky wasn't so sure. It was originally just a simple test, but he didn't expect it to turn out quite like this. Master Feng had to resort to using his trump card!</p>

  <p>After Supreme Lord Sky replied, he stretched out his hand and gently tapped on the enchanted barrier. The barrier spun and began to slowly rise towards the sky.</p>

  <p>The two women were trapped inside the enchanted barrier and watched as they floated further and further away from Luo Luo Zheng. In the end, they glided to the top of the Breaking Cloud Mountain. At this distance, they could only see a small grey dot...</p>

  <p>"Does he really need to send us this far?" Ning Yudie asked with a frown.</p>

  <p>The reason the Supreme Lord sent them so far away was because he was afraid that they would be affected by the shock waves.</p>

  <p>What was Master Feng planning to do after he required them to be so far away in order to be safe? Was he going to kill Luo Luo Zheng?</p>

  <p>It would be impossible to do that. Besides, so many Supreme Lords were present. If he wanted to kill Luo Luo Zheng, there was no need to worry about Yudie's and Freya's safety. There would be no problem if he killed them all together...</p>

  <p>Besides Ning Yudie and Freya, the other Supreme Lords also moved away from Luo Luo Zheng and Master Feng for the time being, leaving the two of them alone in the hall.</p>

  <p>"If you are unable to fight me, I will naturally stop!" After issuing this warning, Master Feng's body suddenly shook as an even more violent Mu Ning was abruptly unleashed from within!</p>

  <p>And then, a Lotus Flower suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>

  <p>All thirty-six petals of the Lotus Flower were open as they slowly rotated while descending.</p>

  <p>"This Lotus Flower has thirty-six petals. It's..." Luo Zheng's face had a look of amazement.</p>

  <p>Normally, a Lotus Flower appeared when a martial artist was undergoing the Heavenly Tribulation.</p>

  <p>At this moment, no one had broken through and reached the new cultivation base. There was no warrior passing through the Heavenly Tribulation either.</p>

  <p>So how come a Lotus Flower appeared suddenly?</p>

  <p>"The Divine Dao my master cultivates is the Evolution Divine Dao, and he has already comprehended the supreme secret of the Evolution Divine Dao. That is the Evolution Lotus Flower!" Master Feng explained, "The Heavenly Destiny I am carrying is the foundation to construct the universe!"</p>

  <p>When the Holy Beings formed the stable universe, the process was very complex, and the means involved were also very special.</p>

  <p>For example, they would build countless great worlds, and after the evolution of these great worlds, they would gradually build the Upper World. Then, they would look at the fence between the Upper World and the Lower World, and construct the ascending passageways between the Upper World and the Lower World...</p>

  <p>There were many long ascending passageways from the Lower World to the Upper World. All of the ascending passageways were constructed by Holy Beings, and not even a Supreme Lord would be able to construct one.</p>

  <p>After all the important stuff in the universe had been built, a round of heavens was required to cover the entire universe.</p>

  <p>That was the greatest comprehension of the world!</p>

  <p>The various Heavenly Destinies were all comprehensions of Luo Xiao. The most important Heavenly Destiny was used to seal the entire universe!</p>

  <p>This Heavenly Destiny was, of course, a supreme one in the universe. It was also the Evolution Lotus Flower, the profound secret created by Luo Xiao after he had mastered the Evolution Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>After sealing the entire universe with the Evolution Lotus Flower, if anyone else wanted to go beyond the heavens, they would have to comprehend the Mahayana Lotus Flower. That was the only way to gain the qualifications to do so!</p>

  <p>Back then, Master Feng had been killed thirteen times by Supreme Lord Lester and resurrected thirteen times, so he had been bestowed with and carried thirteen Heavenly Destinies...</p>

  <p>Three of them were remarkable! They would help Master Feng become a mid-rank Supreme Lord at the very least!</p>

  <p>The thirteenth Heavenly Destiny was the weakest. It was the Heavenly Destiny of Teleportation, which could allow one to instantly appear anywhere in the universe. It was not bad as an auxiliary Heavenly Destiny, but it did not meet the requirements of Master Feng.</p>

  <p>Gritting his teeth, Master Feng made up his mind to die for the fourteenth time. After that, he received a new Heavenly Destiny? the Evolution Lotus Flower!</p>

  <p>It was considered to be a rule above all the Heavenly Destinies in the heavens, and also a Law of Causality.</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower, which was under the control of Master Feng, was slowly approaching Luo Luo Zheng!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower contained a tremendous power.</p>

  <p>When Supreme Lord Sky and Supreme Lord Mirage saw the Lotus Flower, they were extremely worried.</p>

  <p>This Evolution Lotus Flower was the unique technique of Holy Luo Xiao!</p>

  <p>Master Feng was qualified to unleash it because he had inherited this unique technique...</p>

  <p>How could Luo Luo Zheng possibly resist it?</p>

  <p>Besides, according to Master Feng, Luo Luo Zheng had to use his pure strength to fight back, which was proving to be a bit too difficult for him.</p>

  <p>They also knew that Master Feng was stubborn, and they never expected him to be so headstrong while facing Luo Luo Zheng this time.</p>

  <p>Master Feng had only made one move by using the Heavenly Destiny since he carried it.</p>

  <p>At that time, there was an uprising by the Celestial Position race which had a dispute with the ogre race.</p>

  <p>Normally, the Supreme Lords would not interfere in a dispute happening in the Evolutionary Universe. However, two Supreme Lords from the ogre race had killed over ten Spirit Supreme Realm warriors of the Celestial Position race in this skirmish.</p>

  <p>At that time, as the Celestial Position race appeared out of blue, the ogres and other forces didn't take the threat seriously.</p>

  <p>Master Feng had just become a Supreme Lord at that time, and he didn't have much of a reputation in the universe, so no one feared or respected him as a top-rank Supreme Lord...</p>

  <p>In all these years, there had only been a few top-rank Supreme Lords in the universe. The Heavenly Destiny was something that could only be attained by luck and not sought. No one ever thought that the Celestial Position race would use the Heavenly Destiny of Revival to pick this Heavenly Destiny out for Master Feng.</p>

  <p>A few days later, Master Feng made his move on behalf of the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>When the Lotus Flower descended, it came as a shock to all the ogres!</p>

  <p>He was able to defeat the two ogre Supreme Lords with a single move and cause them grave injuries using the Evolution Lotus Flower!</p>

  <p>Other than that, he had also slayed nineteen world lords and three grand world lords of the ogre race...</p>

  <p>The ogres paid a heavy price. Fortunately, Master Feng was merciful so the two Supreme Lords of the ogre race didn't die. As for Supreme Lord Mathias and the others from the ogre race, they didn't dare to say anything or take any action during that period of time...</p>

  <p>After this war, the major forces in the universe started to think highly of the Celestial Position race.</p>

  <p>This rapidly rising race was a little mysterious, but the strength that they possessed made the other forces deeply fearful of them.</p>

  <p>Master Feng naturally did not want to fight with Luo Luo Zheng right now. He was being so persistent only because he wanted to see the limits of Luo Zheng's strength!</p>

  <p>After the Godly Geniuses returned, the Celestial Position race would certainly make new arrangements regarding their positions. Each Godly Genius bore great responsibility and would even take part in the "God Slaughtering Plan". Thus assessment of strength was very important for all of them.</p>

  <p>"Hooo, hooo, hooo..."</p>

  <p>That Lotus Flower slowly descended towards Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, the strength that you have displayed is extraordinary. I wonder if you are strong enough to lift this Lotus Flower!" Master Feng smiled.</p>

  <p>The Evolution Lotus Flower was a kind of Holy Luo Xiao's comprehension of the Divine Dao. Just like Holy Jay's Ice Soul Flame, it was the special skill of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Master Feng's Lotus Flower's power was far inferior to the power displayed by Luo Xiao; in fact it was hardly comparable to the latter.</p>

  <p>However, in this universe, such formidable strength was the most sought-after thing for a martial artist. If he kept improving, he would break the rules and cross the heavens.</p>

  <p>In other words, only a True God would be able to combat Master Feng's Evolution Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>The Lotus Flower continued to hurtle downwards and smashed heavily on Luo Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>A wary expression appeared on Luo Zheng's face. He crossed his arms and shielded himself from the Lotus Flower above him, blocking the bottom part of the flower!</p>

  <p>"Strength..."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng immediately felt the enormous weight of the Lotus Flower.</p>

  <p>The load of the Great Weighty Sword was nothing compared to this mass. If the Great Weighty Sword was as heavy as a great world, then this Lotus Flower was as heavy as a hundred great worlds!</p>

  <p>There was an irresistible force under this back-breaking pressure...</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>The stone beneath Luo Zheng's feet instantly shattered, and his feet sank deep into the ground.</p>
