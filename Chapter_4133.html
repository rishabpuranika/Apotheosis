<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Eternal Realm warriors on the jadeite platform stood still, frozen in shock. They had just read the Memory-recording Crystal which had just revealed to them how the Evil God used over ten thousand avatars to kill Othniel.</p>

  <p>Their expressions were grim. The Evil God once again was proving himself to be an extremely formidable enemy.</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi put his hands behind his back, clutching a golden sword pointing at the sky. An overwhelming sword intent emanated from his body, spreading outwards infinitely.</p>

  <p>Yasamin held the long sword horizontally. She frowned deeply, her wrinkles accentuating her tiredness more than usual. Despite her old age, enemies would've quaked in fear at the incredible power she exuded.</p>

  <p>Any one at the Eternal Realm who had mastered the Blood-controlling Method could dominate the Source World.</p>

  <p>However, the number of Evil Gods kept on increasing. They almost completely covered the sky.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was at a loss. Tears filled her eyes as she helplessly watched her disciples turn into Evil Gods.</p>

  <p>Although they were being possessed by the Evil God, these people were still her disciples.</p>

  <p>With every addition of an Evil God, the Pear Hill lost a disciple.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess didn't have the heart to kill her own people.</p>

  <p>"Can you stop the Evil God?" the Snake Goddess pleaded to the three Chaos Ancient Gods through life vitality.</p>

  <p>Judson shook his head. "He directly possesses the creatures in the Source World. We can't stop him."</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," piped up Gerald. "But I can only save dozens of people at most."</p>

  <p>He was thinking he could stop the Evil God's body possession with the truth of life, but ultimately, it would've been futile since the number of Evil Gods was increasing rapidly.</p>

  <p>Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!</p>

  <p>Two streams of energy, one black, one white, flowed forth from beneath Fuxi's feet, converging to form an illusory Eight Diagrams seal.</p>

  <p>"Spare no mercy," Fuxi said gravely. "They're our enemies now. There's nothing we can do about that."</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Eight Diagrams seal formed an invisible force that started to revolve around Fuxi.</p>

  <p>In the past, Fuxi focused only on improving his own strength. Exerting his bloodline power to the extreme, he sought the fastest and strongest methods to destroy.</p>

  <p>After cultivating the Blood-controlling Method, he had gained a new understanding of his bloodline.</p>

  <p>"Stupid," the Snake Goddess snapped. "It's not a matter of whether they are enemies or not. We have no chance of winning!" The Snake Goddess shot an angry look at Fuxi.</p>

  <p>"Right. It's useless to kill them. No matter how many people we kill, the Evil God can always possess more," Gerald agreed.</p>

  <p>This was simply an unfair battle.</p>

  <p>The Evil God was invincible, so it was useless to exert too much effort just trying to put a dent on him.</p>

  <p>Zheng stared at the sky for a while and pondered. "If we don't have any chance of winning, why don't we focus our efforts on escaping from the Source World?"</p>

  <p>The Evil God could possess the creatures in the Source World. However, his power couldn't reach outside of the Source World.</p>

  <p>"Escape?" Gerald analyzed, "Othniel was the best at that, yet even he was unable to escape. It won't be easy for us to get out of here."</p>

  <p>Gerald had been studying the Memory-recording Crystal, which was how he came up with the idea of escaping the Source World. Indeed, it seemed like the only reasonable thing they could do in this situation.</p>

  <p>However, the Evil God was monitoring Zheng's every movement, so chances of escaping were extremely slim, if not impossible.</p>

  <p>"This is the only way," Zheng said to the crowd telepathically. "We have to give it a try. Let's separate the Pear Hill from the Source World."</p>

  <p>Everyone's expression changed slightly as they pondered over this idea.</p>

  <p>This was probably the only way to save the Pear Hill from total annihilation.</p>

  <p>"While this might be a reasonable suggestion, the Evil God won't be so stupid as to do nothing!" Fuxi countered.</p>

  <p>"Snake Goddess, ask the Primeval Lord of Heaven to descend with the Descending Ring to help us when necessary," Zheng said. Then, turning to look at the sky, he said, "I'll pin down the Evil God first."</p>

  <p>Before returning to the Pear Hill, Zheng had given two Descending Rings to the Primeval Lord of Heaven just in case. He never expected he'd need to use them so soon.</p>

  <p>After saying that, Zheng quickly left the jadeite platform and flew into the sky.</p>

  <p>Even then, the number of Evil Gods was still increasing, one after another.</p>

  <p>It had already surpassed ten thousand, but he showed no signs of stopping.</p>

  <p>He was not in a hurry.</p>

  <p>As long as he was in the Source World, he was invincible.</p>

  <p>The Chaos Ancient Gods, the Eternal Realm warriors and Zheng were all no match for him.</p>

  <p>He waited patiently for them to make the first move. 'It'd be more interesting that way, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Seeing Zheng's approach, he said aloud, "The Eternal Realm warriors have mastered the Blood-controlling Method. That must mean you have, too, right?"</p>

  <p>Over ten thousand Evil Gods stared at Zheng in unison. Their gazes were oppressive, making him feel stressed.</p>

  <p>However, only the one in the lead spoke.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Zheng.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the Evil God lit up. "Then, show me your strength!"</p>

  <p>"You can have a taste!" Zheng said, smiling suddenly.</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, the Evil God gently spread out his palm, and a nearly perfect Ways-blending Energy was formed.</p>

  <p>Zheng cautiously stared at the Ways-blending Energy, vigilantly taking in his surroundings.</p>

  <p>Since he wanted to pin down the Evil God, he needed to provoke him some more.</p>

  <p>"Is this the complete Godly Ways Great Unity?" Zheng asked, pretending to be curious.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's the complete Ways-blending Energy. I haven't been able to comprehend the truth power yet. If you are willing to follow me, I can teach you," said the Evil God calmly.</p>

  <p>"I'm not interested." Zheng shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You will be interested soon!"</p>

  <p>The Evil God's arm shook slightly, and the Ways-blending Energy formed a long sword. Then, he swung his body, and the blade slashed towards Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>With the strength at the peak of the Holy Soul Realm and the power of the Ways-blending Energy, the Evil God was more powerful than many Eternal Realm masters.</p>

  <p>As the Evil God swung towards Zheng, he gently opened his palm to reveal a thin thread of blood. The blood thread quickly converged to form a hollowed-out blood sword.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>The sword made of the Ways-blending Energy and another one made of bloodline connected with a deafening noise.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>For a split second, no one knew what had happened.</p>

  <p>Then, in the next moment, the Evil God's body collapsed into countless fragments that dissipated with the wind. Even the sword formed from the Ways-blending Energy disappeared.</p>

  <p>The other Evil Gods all showed shocked expressions.</p>

  <p>While the Evil God was well aware that he was no match for Zheng alone, he had no idea that the disparity in strength was so great.</p>

  <p>The blood sword in Zheng's hand was too special. The Ways-blending Energy was extinguished the second it connected with the blood sword.</p>

  <p>What kind of bloodline power was this?</p>

  <p>The Evil God had never been to the Eternal Scroll Painting. He didn't know much about the bloodline power, but he could instinctively sense that Zheng's bloodline was special.</p>

  <p>If he could devour Zheng, then he would have his bloodline power.</p>

  <p>When this thought crossed his mind, the Evil God grew even more excited.</p>

  <p>"You deserve to be my creator! Again!"</p>

  <p>This time, two Evil Gods stepped out and attacked Zheng left and right.</p>

  <p>As Zheng kept the Evil God busy, the enchanted barrier underground that Kendrick had set up suddenly started to work.</p>

  <p>The Dragon Scale Defense, like a sharp knife, was trying to separate the Pear Hill from the Source World.</p>
