  <p>
</p>

  <p>Konnor had overestimated himself and underestimated the other sects' determination to target Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>The giant stones of the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect had suddenly begun to accelerate. Their third runes were already occupied. The moment they released the Truth of Divine Dao, enchanted barriers emerged from the surfaces of the two giant stones and wrapped them within.</p>

  <p>The Seven Mountains Meeting was not a competition between the sects of Taiyi Heaven Palace. It was in fact a big event.</p>

  <p>The three runes on the giant stones had three functions: to control, speed up, and cast an enchanted barrier. This was meant to prevent the disciples from fighting each other as much as possible.</p>

  <p>Now that these two stones were on either side of them, trying to intercept their way, Mekhi couldn't accelerate as required.</p>

  <p>"Jax!"</p>

  <p>Konnor called out desperately.</p>

  <p>Jax Gong stepped on the third rune, and the moment he released the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, the enchanted barrier on the giant stone began to glow.</p>

  <p>Judging from the thickness of the enchanted barrier, Jax Gong's compatibility with the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was nothing compared to that of the disciples from the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect. But he had no other choice now.</p>

  <p>The moment the enchanted barrier formed, the two giant stones on either side of them collided with the giant stone of the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>The three stones were well protected by enchanted barriers, which reduced the impact of the collision so it wasn't too destructive.</p>

  <p>Having been squeezed on both sides, the enchanted barrier was now stuck in the middle and couldn't move. Konnor's efforts to break away were in vain.</p>

  <p>Moments later, the giant stone of the Vastness Mountain that Marco was operating shot towards them.</p>

  <p>It flew up some distance and then came crashing down. It looked like it was about to knock the Heart Flow Sect's giant stone to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Quit, you idiots!" Marco said tauntingly.</p>

  <p>He looked down at the people of the Heart Flow Sect, his eyes finally landing on Luo Zheng. At Luo Zheng's clenched fists, his eyes filled with mocking.</p>

  <p>'You have no idea what I'm capable of, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>The impact of the collision was terrifying.</p>

  <p>The moment he brought the giant stone of the Vastness Mountain crashing against that of the Heart Flow Sect, the Killing Sword Sect and the Unique Array Sword Sect moved away.</p>

  <p>The giant stone of the Heart Flow Sect spun in midair and came crashing down like a shooting star.</p>

  <p>"Aaaaaah!"</p>

  <p>Imran and the other disciples shrieked as they were thrown off the giant stone.</p>

  <p>Close by, Dorothy was also competing against the giant stones of the other sects. She was responsible for the accelerating rune and Jermain piloted the stone of the Origin Mountain.</p>

  <p>Since Dorothy had the time to observe what was going on, the sight of the Heart Flow Sect on the brink of elimination filled her with anxiety. 'This is bad, ' she thought.</p>

  <p>Many looked on in horror as they watched the Heart Flow Sect's giant stone fall.</p>

  <p>On the top of the cave was a hollow, in which a stone bench and a small stove sat.</p>

  <p>Tea brewed in a utensil atop the stove.</p>

  <p>Four people sat on the stone bench. Qiu Yinhe, Goran, Winchell, and an energetic old man.</p>

  <p>The old man was the one who Luo Zheng had seen distributing flags in Dragon City. His appearance hadn't changed much, but his aura was different from before.</p>

  <p>"Qiu Yinhe, you have been too confident. The last time the Heart Flow Sect ranked first in this event, but this time, every sect is targeting them. I don't see a chance for the sect to win. They can't even go up to the second layer of the metal mountain," Winchell laughed.</p>

  <p>Qiu Yinhe smiled helplessly as he shook his head. "Konnor is too cautious. If he had let Luo Zheng help him from the beginning, the situation might have been very different."</p>

  <p>But Goran did not agree with him. "Luo Zheng wouldn't have been able to make a difference. The disciples from the other mountains are also strong this time.</p>

  <p>He is not the only one who has the ability of Instant Enlightenment."</p>

  <p>The rewards of the Seven Mountains Meeting were so rich this time that even those like Feng Ge, who hadn't taken part in the past years, had signed up for it. The other mountains also had some secluded talents, which meant that this year's event was obviously much more difficult than the previous one.</p>

  <p>Everyone had begun to think that the Heart Flow Sect was about to be kicked out when Konnor's aura suddenly glowed fiercely.</p>

  <p>He sprang off the stone into a perfect somersault and came to land gracefully on the ground.</p>

  <p>The rules dictated that the moment his feet left the stone, he couldn't return to it.</p>

  <p>But he had to do something for his sect.</p>

  <p>The moment he landed on the ground, a huge hand made of black stone appeared over his head.</p>

  <p>It was a descending type of Other Shore Token, called the Diabolic Sun-grasping Hand.</p>

  <p>The Diabolic Sun-grasping Hand was a very rare Other Shore Token belonging to Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore. It was of the descending type, but had a terrifying power that could reach up to four hundred Jun.</p>

  <p>It could also be used as a magic weapon.</p>

  <p>"Diabolic Sun-grasping Hand! Go!"</p>

  <p>Among the elite disciples, Konnor's talent was known to be only slightly above average. But he was number one, aside from Milo, among the disciples of the Heart Flow Sect.</p>

  <p>He surpassed Milo in terms of appeal force, mainly because of the Other Shore Token he owned.</p>

  <p>The Diabolic Sun-grasping Hand turned into a huge fist and hit the falling stone.</p>

  <p>The huge stone shook at the impact, throwing ten more people off of it.</p>

  <p>The stone changed direction and began to fly sideways.</p>

  <p>Konnor had tried his best and since he was now out of the race, all he could do was watch. He said, "We're counting on you now, Luo Zheng."</p>

  <p>Everyone was surprised at Konnor's actions.</p>

  <p>"Konnor is quite tough and stubborn!"</p>

  <p>"His Other Shore Token has great potential and can be further developed. It can be of huge help if fully used!"</p>

  <p>"But there's no use, him struggling like this. His sect has only seven people left on the stone. They can't make such a giant stone move in the air, right?"</p>

  <p>The crowd began to panic when the giant stone tilted in the air.</p>

  <p>It was losing direction, without Konnor's control.</p>

  <p>Even though everyone had gone all out to bring it back on track, the stone kept swaying to its side.</p>

  <p>"You are so stubborn! Let me give you a ride to hell!"</p>

  <p>Marco controlled the giant stone of his sect, bringing it smashing down on the Heart Flow Sect's stone again with a menacing momentum.</p>

  <p>The Heart Flow Sect's stone would probably fall down even without the influence of any external force. Marco's attack would only make the fall quicker.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved a hand.</p>

  <p>The invisible force turned into two chains, circling around him, and then enveloping the entirety of the giant stone.</p>

  <p>This was the advantage of being proficient in the Might Divine Dao. Luo Zheng was now fixed on the giant stone.</p>

  <p>He slid on the stone until he came to the control rune, where Konnor had been.</p>

  <p>He activated the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent and the Strength God Totem, releasing both the powerful Other Shore Power and the truth aura.</p>

  <p>"Rise!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng commanded.</p>
