<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>"The fourth one?" Luo Zheng asked. Even though he was still in shock, he did not miss the key words in Saul's words. "So there are other people who have also been here? In the fairy palace?" Luo Zheng asked some more.</p>

  <p>Nodding in agreement, Saul explained, "Of course, there were other people who had been here and opened the Eight Diagrams. But they all failed and died.</p>

  <p>So, I hope that you can succeed. I do not want to wait any longer. I've had enough of it."</p>

  <p>"All failed? All died? What does that mean?" Luo Zheng asked with a frown on his face.</p>

  <p>It would seem that he would not like the things that were about to happen.</p>

  <p>"If you want to be the master of the fairy palace, you have to pass the test. Of course, there are many dangers in the test--and if you fail, you will die naturally..." Saul explained slowly.</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes slowly widened, and a lump formed in his throat.</p>

  <p>"I will die if I fail? Then, can I choose not to attend the test and leave now?" Luo Zheng stared at Saul and asked hopefully. At this, Saul simply smiled.</p>

  <p>"Hah, hah, hah," he chuckled. "It is okay to give up according to the regulations. My powerful master won't force others to become the new master of his fairy palace. Besides, only a truly qualified and contented man could inherit his property. However, I do not want to wait any longer," he added.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pondered over Saul's words for a bit.</p>

  <p>'Ah... in that case, I have to attend the test anyway. It seems that Saul has had enough lonely time and he would definitely force me to attend the test, even though the master of the fairy palace provided two options, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>The hesitation in Zheng's face did not escape Saul's gaze, and he went on to say, "Rest assured! In order to make sure you can pass the test, I will try my best to help you and give you guidance when I am permitted. I have waited for thousands of years and finally got you here. Even though the test is very dangerous, I will do my utmost to help you!" Saul said.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng felt that he had no other choice, he simply sighed.</p>

  <p>"Well, okay. I understand now. And how can I pass the test? When can I start? Where is the test place?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>With a wave of his hand, Saul said, "Come with me!"</p>

  <p>He turned around and walked to the back. Just then, those pink enchanted barriers around the pavilion slowly faded away.</p>

  <p>At this point, Luo Zheng looked at Saul who walked slowly ahead of him and thought about whether it would be better for him to use this opportunity to escape. As long as he could run to the jade path with his fastest speed, he could return back to the outer world. Those nature creatures waiting outside would not pose any great threats to him.</p>

  <p>However, after having thought about it for one more time, Luo Zheng gave up his idea of escape. It had been hard for him to get inside the fairy palace and even harder for him to survive after the desperate fight with those powerful foes a while ago. How could he go back without anything gained? That would be very disappointing for him.</p>

  <p>After he had collected his thoughts, Luo Zheng stepped forward and kept pace with Saul. It seemed that the human puppet didn't notice Zheng's inner mental struggle and simply took Luo Zheng to the other jade path. This particular jade path led to another area in the fairy palace.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng and Saul stepped on the jade path, those fishes gathered once again.</p>

  <p>"Whap!"</p>

  <p>One of the large fishes jumped out of the water and lunged towards the two of them.</p>

  <p>"Look out!" Luo Zheng warned.</p>

  <p>His eyes darted left and right to spot any attacks.</p>

  <p>He had seen the strength of these fishes before. The way they tore and completely ate up one powerful man of the Illuminating Soul Realm in just a few minutes was still fresh in his mind.</p>

  <p>However, his worries turned out to be useless. Saul turned his head towards the fish coming at him. He stretched out his hand, and then his fingers elongated like withered wood to a few meters long.</p>

  <p>When his fingers made contact with the fish, he clenched his fingers and abruptly inserted them into the fish's body. The goldfish could only helplessly flap around its tail in the air but couldn't escape from Saul's hand.</p>

  <p>Saul then slowly wrapped his hand around the fish and sliced it into pieces. The once huge, powerful Koi fish now looked like small, normal fish in Saul's hand. After that, he threw away the fish's remnants into the water.</p>

  <p>"These goldfishes have lived here for such a long time that they have forgotten the rules. Several thousand years ago when master was still here, these goldfishes were much more obedient than they are now," Saul said as he slowly withdrew his fingers.</p>

  <p>To see such a scene filled Zheng's heart with fright. He felt lucky that he did not choose to escape. Otherwise, he might have been torn to pieces by Saul, just like the goldfish .Although Saul was a puppet, the strength he showed just now indicated that it would be easy for Saul to kill him in few seconds. Even the powers of those Illuminating Soul Realm masters could not match that of Saul.</p>

  <p>That goldfish that was cut to pieces immediately attracted other goldfishes. They fought each other for the flesh and bones of the dead goldfish, even though this fish was their companion just few minutes ago. For a time, the originally small and calm pool waters rippled and rose up in waves, like the sea during a tsunami.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, these goldfishes were not so stupid to challenge Saul and Luo Zheng again, after seeing that their compatriot had been cut into pieces just now. They just stayed beneath the water on both sides of the pool but dare not jump out to attack Saul and Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Without the goldfishes' attacks now, the travel along the jade path became safe just like it was a normal path. However, as Saul walked rather slowly, it still took them some time to reach the end of the path until they crossed a door to another yard.</p>

  <p>The door creaked a bit when Saul opened it. Upon stepping inside, the courtyard, Luo Zheng noticed that there were three puppets laid on the edge of the courtyard. However, these three puppets were not so delicate as Saul.</p>

  <p>When Saul saw that Zheng's eyes were focused on those puppets, Saul explained, "You can select anyone of these puppets. They are made for you!"</p>

  <p>One eyebrow shot up in Zheng's forehead.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If you fail in the test, I will save you and take your soul out, then seal your soul in this puppet. Then you can stay with me for long time, as if you were not dead," Saul said as he pointed to the three puppets.</p>

  <p>"Those souls of the failed challengers had lived here too.</p>

  <p>However, my craftsmanship is not as good as the master's. I could only keep the soul alive in the puppet for a thousand years, but I could not make it immortal, just as what my master did to me," he finished.</p>

  <p>Now, Luo Zheng had finally understood what Saul meant. In order to have a companion with him, Saul had made some puppets here.</p>

  <p>Those who previously broke into the fairy palace and failed the test were made into puppets.</p>

  <p>Even though Saul was not as good as his master in making the puppets, the appearance of these three puppets weren't so bad. They looked like they didn't have any major damages. However, the souls within the puppets had faded away after thousands of years.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng thought about being sealed in the puppet by Saul if he failed the test, he couldn't help but feel scared. He swallowed nervously. It would be miserable to live a lonely life in puppet for a thousand years.</p>
