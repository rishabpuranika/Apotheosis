<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>When any kind of material was trapped or came into contact with the Cold Prison, it would be instantly converted into a different form, and energy was no exception.</p>

  <p>No matter how strong the energy in the Primordial Energy Cat's stomach was, it was rendered useless in the face of the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>This turn of events was something that the Snake Goddess and King Ieuan never expected.</p>

  <p>They didn't know the existence of the Cold Prison, nor did they see Lamont use such an ability before.</p>

  <p>If it was Othniel or Herbert, they were sure that the two would have perished in the Primordial Energy Cat's stomach. Unfortunately, they had to deal with Lamont right now.</p>

  <p>Lamont looked down at a crushed stone in the Pear Hill. "King Ieuan, I'm disappointed at you. After colluding with the Pear Hill, this is all you can do?"</p>

  <p>King Ieuan stood on the stone and looked up at Lamont with a gloomy gaze.</p>

  <p>In the past, it once boasted as the richest creature in the Source World.</p>

  <p>However, the massive amount of divine crystals that it had didn't bring any qualitative changes to its race. So, King Ieuan decided to make use of the divine crystals.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Snake Goddess and Fuxi, the Divine Crystal Array was flawlessly established. Everything went smoothly— or so they thought.</p>

  <p>Then came Lamont. In an instant, the tide of the battle suddenly went against their favor.</p>

  <p>All the terrifying energy that swarmed at Lamont turned into mere dots of light that vanished immediately after. Witnessing all that, King Ieuan couldn't begin to imagine how powerful Lamont really was.</p>

  <p>"Lucky for me, I have grasped the skill of creating the Cold Prison. If not, I might have died in your cat's stomach. But unfortunately for you…"</p>

  <p>As he was still speaking, Lamont stretched out a finger and aimed at King Ieuan below. A white aura began circling on his fingertip. An extreme murderous intent was oozing in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>A blast of cold air was condensed into a white arrow. It quickly darted off from Lamont's finger and dashed towards King Ieuan.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan just stared at the approaching arrow, as if fear and helplessness crippled its entire body.</p>

  <p>"My king, get a hold of yourself!"</p>

  <p>"You need to run!"</p>

  <p>Oakley, Dempsey, and the three other Ear Mice rushed over to King Ieuan as fast as they could.</p>

  <p>The five Ear Mice were King Ieuan's most trusted subordinates. Even in the most hopeless situation, their loyalty and passion to protect their king remained undaunted.</p>

  <p>"Divine Picture Shield!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, a round purple shield appeared above Oakley's head.</p>

  <p>Aside from the Heaven Shaking Gold, the Divine Picture Shield was its most powerful Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>It was a defense-type Other Shore Token from Stage Thirty-three. The power of any kind of attack that came in contact with it would automatically be reduced to one-third of its original strength.</p>

  <p>With this, even if Lamont was a high-level Eternal Realm master, Oakley was confident that it would withstand his attack.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Oakley's eyes widened as it saw that the white arrow pierced through the Divine Picture Shield. It didn't stop for one bit, and it drilled into Oakley's chest. Immediately after, Oakley became frozen like an ice sculpture.</p>

  <p>Seeing what happened, Dempsey, who was behind Oakley, immediately threw an Interchange Stone Tablet towards the white arrow. The moment it latched onto the arrow, Dempsey activated the stone tablets.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the white arrow disappeared and re-appeared in another direction where it pierced into another huge piece of rock.</p>

  <p>The rock that came into contact with the arrow became brittle and instantly shattered into a pile of ice dregs.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan came back to its senses and was astonished at Oakley's sudden death. Its face was quickly filled with grief and anger. It abruptly took out two Other Shore Tokens, which were a pair of sharp and shiny knives.</p>

  <p>The light reflecting on the knives left countless deep cuts on the surface of the surrounding rubbles.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan knew that in one way or another, it was going to be killed by Lamont. So, it chose to fight until death rather than try to escape like a pathetic king.</p>

  <p>"Tch. Do you think your bravery will gain you anything? You useless rodent!"</p>

  <p>Lamont had no intention of taking King Ieuan seriously. So, he raised his hand and decided to kill the latter in a swift manner.</p>

  <p>Just then, several golden light blades came rushing from a distance and rained on Lamont.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Crash!</p>

  <p>The moment the light blades fell into the Cold Prison, they instantly turned into countless dots of light that eventually vanished.</p>

  <p>Standing on the Panoramic View Peak, Yan glared at Lamont with tremendous hostility.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew the secret of the Cold Prison, and he also knew that at the current level of the Energy Shaft, it would be useless and too weak to break the Cold Prison, let alone damage Lamont.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't expect that Yan would suddenly make a move, so he had no time to stop her.</p>

  <p>Lamont was initially focused on dealing with King Ieuan, but after Yan's sudden attack, she successfully attracted his attention.</p>

  <p>"Human girl, I'd like to commend you for your courage."</p>

  <p>Lamont turned towards Yan with a huge ugly smile on his gorilla-like face.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, his huge body rushed towards her.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Yan quickly unleashed the golden shield again.</p>

  <p>With the efforts of the Ear Mice, the energy of the Cloud Cover Array was replenished to such an extent that the golden shield was quite solid.</p>

  <p>Then, Lamont stretched out a finger. In an instant, the shield turned into dots of light and immediately dissipated.</p>

  <p>Lamont let out a horrifying laugh. He quickly clenched his fist and attempted to throw a massive punch directed at Yan.</p>

  <p>As his fist was approaching her, the Cold Prison touched Yan and dispersed her energy.</p>

  <p>She didn't disappear but was transformed into a form under the extremely low temperature. It was actually very similar to the form outside of the chaos.</p>

  <p>"B-brother…"</p>

  <p>As her consciousness was slowly fading, her instinct made her call for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Zheng's body expanded as he activated his Wild God Body.</p>

  <p>The truth was he didn't want to fight any Chaos Ancient God right now.</p>

  <p>Before he had mastered the ancestry-level bloodline, his strength was just comparable to that of an ordinary Eternal Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>However, he didn't have much choice right now. In the face of the overwhelming odds, he had to bite the bullet.</p>

  <p>In addition to unleashing his own strength, he could only bet on the power of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>"I hope you can be smart enough to know what you are doing!"</p>

  <p>In a flash, Zheng's body expanded to a height of more than four million feet, like a huge mountain, protecting Yan at all costs.</p>

  <p>Lamont was over ten million feet tall, so Zheng was just half of his size.</p>

  <p>As Lamont threw the punch towards Yan, he clearly saw how Zheng turned into a giant. A smile crossed his ferocious face and his expression became more intense.</p>

  <p>'Come to think of it, is this the guy that Herbert mentioned?</p>

  <p>They said that they will be capturing him alive.</p>

  <p>Ha-ha, they can't blame me. He's the one who walks into his death, '</p>

  <p>Lamont thought.</p>

  <p>Even Lamont couldn't fully control the Cold Prison. Anything that came in contact with it would be ripped off its energy, and Lamont couldn't restore them either. Trying to protect Yan, Zheng rushed into the Cold Prison and approached Lamont's fist by throwing his own massive punch. Lamont couldn't help laughing in his mind because he knew that Zheng already fell into the trap, and he would surely end up like the others who became victims of the Cold Prison.</p>

  <p>However, Lamont's expression suddenly changed and his eyes widened.</p>

  <p>Crash!</p>

  <p>With a muffled sound, Zheng's fist collided with Lamont's. Zheng wasn't stopped by the Cold Prison and his energy didn't dissipate either.</p>

  <p>Due to the overwhelming force that Zheng had put in his fist, Lamont was pushed back and had to take several steps backward.</p>

  <p>Lamont's force was undoubtedly more powerful than Zheng's. However, he didn't use his full strength just now because he didn't expect that it would be necessary.</p>

  <p>As Lamont regained his balance, he stared at Zheng with a visibly disorganized expression on his face. He was trying to understand what had just happened. He was thinking if Zheng used a certain secret skill that he missed to notice.</p>

  <p>"This can't be… You! What the hell did you do?"</p>

  <p>Lamont knew very well how the Cold Prison worked, so he was flabbergasted at what just happened.</p>

  <p>"What? You're wondering why the Cold Prison didn't work on me?" Zheng looked at his slightly stiff fist and brushed off the frost on its surface. "Well, your Cold Prison is only so-so."</p>
