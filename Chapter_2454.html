<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>It was known that a Multiple Antennae Snake was much stronger than a Snake Spirit.</p>

  <p>Yet no matter how powerful a Multiple Antennae Snake was, it was still alone. It couldn't possibly kill everyone in front of it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the Snake Spirit was on a whole different level? it could summon almost everything related to snakes in the divine land.</p>

  <p>If it was still alive, it could even summon a large number of Multiple Antennae Snakes.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, the reason the Multiple Antennae Snake was there was to protect the Snake Spirit.</p>

  <p>"I'll go kill that Snake Spirit, and you go save Reinhard," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>There was no time to hesitate in such a crucial moment. They based most of their decisions on instinct as even one second of hesitation could land them in a desperate situation.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A gust of wind blew as Luo Zheng flew towards the little snake on his flying sword.</p>

  <p>In turn, the snake's antennae flailed wildly when it saw Luo Zheng, then prepared to pounce and bind him.</p>

  <p>Just a few moments ago, the antennae had caught Reinhard off-guard. There was no way Luo Zheng would make the same mistake.</p>

  <p>He was still rushing forward on his flying sword and did not intend to make any move, when a red figure suddenly jumped up behind him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the long spear circled around Xun's waist like mad, so that it almost looked like it was a dancing wheel.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not evaluate the avatar's strength.</p>

  <p>After all, he didn't have enough spare time to test it in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>Besides, Xun's attack was extremely powerful that even he himself could not resist. She was undoubtedly his greatest ally in the debate venue.</p>

  <p>The red spear turned in a few moments, and then all the tentacles were ground into shreds of flesh.</p>

  <p>The ground shook as Luo Zheng immediately ran over to it without hesitation!</p>

  <p>The small jasper snake continued to drill a hole into the ground as it simultaneously summoned numerous Three-Element Snakes, which surrounded him.</p>

  <p>In response, he ran straight towards them without second thoughts.</p>

  <p>All the Three-Element Snakes that collided with him were smashed into smithereens.</p>

  <p>If a Three-Element Snake exploded, it released three kinds of deadly venom at the same time. Other True Gods normally avoided touching the venom at all costs, but Luo Zheng did not care.</p>

  <p>In just the blink of an eye, he had already traversed a distance of a thousand feet.</p>

  <p>"Hiss..."</p>

  <p>The small jasper snake was clearly provoked when it saw Luo Zheng charge at it.</p>

  <p>Then, it wriggled and hissed constantly in a strange fashion, as if it was speaking in some kind of language.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, it summoned new snakes every time it began to speak in the snake language. All the Three-Element Snakes disappeared in a second and were replaced by tons of pythons that were as thick as tree trunks. Thy turned out to be the fourth-grade fierce beasts, Death Bringers!</p>

  <p>It was no question that the sea of the Three-Element Snakes was already more than terrifying.</p>

  <p>Among the more than one hundred True Gods that stayed put, six of them had been bitten and two of them had died after the venom had entered their elixir fields.</p>

  <p>If the sea of Three-Element Snakes had continued to attack, more people might have died.</p>

  <p>When the Three-Element Snakes disappeared, things seemed to get better until the fourth-grade fierce beasts, Death Bringers showed up. Now they were about to attack, and there might be even worse damages!</p>

  <p>Even though Solomon and the others had formed a sword array that faced the snake sea, they didn't look too hopeful.</p>

  <p>Everyone would die if Reinhard and Luo Zheng failed. Not to mention, they were still quite far from the end of the debate venue.</p>

  <p>"Hold on!"</p>

  <p>"We must have faith in Reinhard!"</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish!"</p>

  <p>Huge rays of sword radiance in the shape of a crescent spread out everywhere and in the blink of an eye, they had killed hundreds of thousands of Three-Element Snakes. Yet, more Three-Element Snakes had formed a sea of snakes that surged like the tide. There were too many of them to kill!</p>

  <p>Just as their group was about to give in to exhaustion, the snake shadows in the mist changed once again.</p>

  <p>The snake sea the Three-Element Snakes had formed disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Death Bringers!"</p>

  <p>"Fourth-grade fierce beasts!"</p>

  <p>"Did Reinhard and the others fail?"</p>

  <p>The True Gods felt like they could cry a river when they looked at the awfully dense mass of Death Bringers.</p>

  <p>They all knew that the debate venue was a dangerous place, but this was just too much for them.</p>

  <p>The Death Bringer was known for its fierceness, ferocity, and overpowering strength. They usually moved alone in the Swirl Forest, but even so, it was already hard enough to fight one of them. Its huge body was strong enough to crush even a True God.</p>

  <p>Now, there were tens of thousands of Death Bringers.</p>

  <p>Then again, such was a unique feature of the debate venue.</p>

  <p>If all True Gods had very weak fear incarnations? say, such unintelligent fierce beasts as the Giant Thunder Rhinoceros, then it would be easy for them to enter the debate venue.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Sword Clan had done a test to see if it would succeed.</p>

  <p>They sent some innocent, kind-hearted disciples of the Sword Clan, who barely saw the outside world, to enter the debate venue.</p>

  <p>These disciples came from a simple background, and logically speaking, they did not find anything particular to be afraid of. The Sword Clan, however, quickly discovered that they were too naive.</p>

  <p>The fear in their hearts was from their subconsciousness. Those disciples from the Sword Clan might appear to be simple but in fact, they were more likely to have an unexplainable fear incarnation. Some of those fears were strong enough to be truly incomprehensible, and that they had intangible means of killing to the point that they directly killed two consummate True Gods of the Sword Clan!</p>

  <p>Now, the True Gods were all scared looking at the Snake Spirit and the numerous Death Bringers in front of them.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Duke appeared to be quite relaxed. It seemed that the preparations he had made weren't needed after all.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>The huge, overly thick and massive Death Bringers swarmed around Luo Zheng until dozens of them were completely wrapped around him, all in a span of three seconds. He was already invisible under the pile of thick snakes, but more Death Bringers tangled around him and formed a python tower.</p>

  <p>If one python was already horrifying to even see, how much more dozens of them?</p>

  <p>Not too far away was the small jasper snake, who watched the whole scene with its malicious, beady eyes that seemed to smile. The vicious creature was clearly a clever and wise being.</p>

  <p>Yet, it didn't feel complacent for too long.</p>

  <p>Blood suddenly spurted out from the middle of the python tower, followed by a massive force that exploded and flew straight towards the small jasper snake!</p>

  <p>"Die!" shouted a faint voice from the python tower.</p>

  <p>After Reinhard found the Snake Spirit, Luo Zheng quickly fixed his spiritual sense on it.</p>

  <p>Although he was trapped in the heap of Death Bringers, the distance was short enough for him to use the Four Swords Change of Gods Killing Sword Array.</p>

  <p>He then summoned the Buddha Emperor Sword.</p>

  <p>Finally, it was shot directly at the small jasper snake.</p>

  <p>The moment he finished speaking, the Buddha Emperor Sword had already cut it in half!</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit wasn't that strong, but its upper half still tried to drill into the ground with a tenacious momentum despite being cut in half.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape? You're dreaming," Luo Zheng sneered.</p>

  <p>The Buddha Emperor Sword circled around the Snake Spirit, before it cut its body into thin pieces.</p>

  <p>When it finally died, the Death Bringers that surrounded Luo Zheng and the other millions of Death Bringers in the mist disappeared as well.</p>
