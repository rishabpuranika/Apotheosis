<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1766 The Sorcerer Race's Purpose </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Thousands of core disciples swarmed into the palace.</p>

  <p>As they arrived, more and more magnificent divine textures appeared over the palace, forming a cross-shaped shield. This was the biggest divine texture array of the Pure Jade Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>"Boom, boom..."</p>

  <p>Several bolts of black lightning appeared from the sky and dozens of skulls rained down, as countless black shadows dashed towards the underground palace.</p>

  <p>At that moment, two slender and long energy tentacles stretched out from the divine texture array.</p>

  <p>These two energy tentacles held extremely terrible power. Hundreds of members of the sorcerer race were quickly eliminated with just one sweep! As they died, multiple skulls appeared and began to bite at the divine texture array.</p>

  <p>These small skulls were the sorcerer race's curse and were very special.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng already encountered them back in the Illusion Battlefield. These skulls were very persistent and did not let go of him until they were forced to disappear once he entered the second stage of the competition.</p>

  <p>The two slender tentacles also swept these skulls away but they only came back a few minutes later to continue biting away at the divine texture array.</p>

  <p>Back in the underground palace, all the core disciples looked pale.</p>

  <p>Most of them had taken part in the Illusion Battlefield. They were now in the real world and if they died during this siege, they died for real.</p>

  <p>Preston leaned on the side of a huge column as several small skulls continued biting away at his protective life vitality.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right?" Ning Yudie asked.</p>

  <p>Preston shook his head. "Crack!" He had taken out a life vitality jade and broke it, quickly absorbing the life vitality within.</p>

  <p>The small skulls continually consumed Preston's protective life vitality and it was only a matter of time before they got through to his flesh and blood.</p>

  <p>Preston's life vitality jades weren't enough to offset the amount he consumed, or rather, the amount these small skulls consumed.</p>

  <p>A gush of blood streamed down his back as the small skulls chewed on his flesh.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie frowned when she saw this. She quickly summoned a gust of cold air from her hand and froze the small skulls in place. This kind of action worked but only for less than three seconds.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>The solid ice cracked as the small skulls bit and swallowed it down.</p>

  <p>Freed from the freezing cold, the skulls immediately commenced with biting Preston's back all over again.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, in the three seconds it took for the skulls to break through the ice, 30 percent of Preston's protective life vitality had already recovered.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Ah..."</p>

  <p>At that moment, a warrior had let out a loud scream as he tumbled onto the ground and fell into a pool of blood.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie looked at the fallen warrior. He had been at the Spirit Supreme Realm but had now been reduced to a mound of flesh and blood that the skulls gnawed on continuously. It looked nothing short of terrifying.</p>

  <p>Even Preston, who was a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior, couldn't resist these small skulls, let alone the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>Not everyone had Luo Zheng's impossibly hard body after all.</p>

  <p>The warrior's entire back had been split open and the smell of blood was horrible.</p>

  <p>"Get away!"</p>

  <p>A few other warriors shouted at the skulls. They swung their hands and drove them away. The skulls were thrown off for a bit but they immediately flew back towards the fallen warrior to continue biting his back.</p>

  <p>A lot of warriors had killed quite a number of sorcerer race members earlier and no one expected the curse that followed as a consequence. If this continued, they would all end up getting killed by these skulls.</p>

  <p>"What to do..."</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie muttered in frustration. If only Luo Luo Zheng was here...</p>

  <p>Back in the Lower World, Ning Yudie rarely ever relied on him.</p>

  <p>However, ever since her ascension to the Upper World, she quickly bore witness to the cruelty of this world's system. In the face of the strongest warriors, she couldn't help but think back on how great it would be if she had someone to rely on, someone like Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>This strange world was even crueler than what she had imagined.</p>

  <p>Cries of misery continued to resound all around her.</p>

  <p>Several martial artists had already succumbed to these small skulls.</p>

  <p>Many lay motionless on the ground but the skulls continued gnawing on their flesh, not stopping until they completely devoured their targets.</p>

  <p>The universe was also in a state of panic. Everyone's ears rang with cries of help from many world lords and orders from Supreme Lords to gather their subordinates.</p>

  <p>Some Supreme Lords began to move towards a few supreme worlds but none of them mentioned the Pure Jade Sacred Place.</p>

  <p>"Is this the end of the world?" someone roared in despair.</p>

  <p>"No... I believe that the powerful warriors of the alliance will take action!"</p>

  <p>"Everyone, just hold on!"</p>

  <p>"It's so painful. Who can help me destroy these damn skulls?"</p>

  <p>Around 20 percent of the underground palace's warriors had been cursed and were now being mercilessly devoured by these small skulls.</p>

  <p>Nobody could destroy them or even stop them. The other warriors could only watch in horror as their comrades slowly succumbed from being eaten by floating skulls.</p>

  <p>"Once these skulls are done with them, would they also come for us?" someone asked.</p>

  <p>His question plunged the entire underground palace into silence.</p>

  <p>Those warriors who had been struck by the sorcerer race's curse were goners but many of those who survived still trusted the protection the underground palace provided.</p>

  <p>However, if these small skulls turned on them, then this sanctuary would quickly turn into a slaughterhouse!</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie also paled. She did not come here to end up getting devoured by these small skulls!</p>

  <p>"Master Preston, do you have a Roaring Token?" Ning Yudie asked.</p>

  <p>Preston was stunned at her question but immediately understood what she was trying to do. She was no doubt going to call Luo Luo Zheng out for help.</p>

  <p>This was indeed a good course of action. With Luo Zheng's current identity, he would definitely have powerful warriors surrounding him. If he came here, then the Pure Jade Sacred Place would be prioritized in getting rescued.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Preston shook his head. "The Roaring Token is so rare so I don't possess such a treasure. Only the Saint Lord has one..."</p>

  <p>A trace of sadness appeared on Yudie's face when she heard this.</p>

  <p>As they spoke, two other warriors had fallen and were completely devoured by these small skulls. The only thing they left behind was a puddle of blood and nothing else. As s small skull's jawbone hit the floor, it emitted a loud screech and immediately flew towards another warrior!</p>

  <p>"Ah!" the warrior screamed.</p>

  <p>It seemed their assumptions had been correct.</p>

  <p>This place was no longer safe. They had to leave or they'd end up being food for these hungry, flesh-eating skulls!</p>
