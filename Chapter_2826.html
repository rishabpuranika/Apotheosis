  <p>
</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Zheng's authoritative voice, the woman had no other choice but to create another space channel. She gritted her teeth while doing it.</p>

  <p id="top">In an instant, she, together with Samuel's clone, disappeared from Zheng's side.</p>

  <p>As the two of them disappeared, the big hand reappeared and swung at Zheng, trying to take a hold of his head.</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng's eyes suddenly flashed bright red. It was as if they were made of rubies.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>Slowly, the girl with red eyes and hair emerged and silently floated behind him.</p>

  <p>He began to stretch out his hand, and as he did, a thin line of red lotuses appeared on his arm. Then, out of nowhere, they shot towards the direction of the big hand of the shadow.</p>

  <p>The girl had already integrated with him, and they had started to partake in each other's energies.</p>

  <p>Since the girl's energy hadn't been used up, Zheng didn't need to use his internal momentum to produce the red lotuses.</p>

  <p>The exact moment the red lotuses touched the shadow, an incredibly strong reaction took place.</p>

  <p>Since the shadow that was summoned by Nicholas was also some kind of energy, the red lotuses were able to transform it into another type of energy.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of an untrained warrior, the shadow just caught on fire.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the shadow that was over 60, 000 feet tall started burning, upping the temperature around it into unfathomable levels.</p>

  <p>Everyone and everything near it was scrambling to flee to safety.</p>

  <p>But due to a special method done by Nicholas, despite the giant shadow being tall, it didn't have too much energy. Because of that, its fiery threat only lasted for a couple of seconds and immediately disappeared.</p>

  <p>After successfully defeating the giant shadow, Zheng glanced over his shoulder. When he saw what was happening, his expression darkened.</p>

  <p>It turned out that while he was battling the giant shadow, Nicholas had already summoned another one to deal with the woman.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The moment the woman came out, a huge hand was already patting her head.</p>

  <p>She had seen the power of the shadow before. As she could not avoid it, a fierce and determined look flashed across her eyes and she began gathering the force of primitive fear in the black water.</p>

  <p>"Break it!"</p>

  <p>With those words, she pointed upwards.</p>

  <p>The force of primitive fear that surged out of her transformed itself into a brown spear that was over a thousand feet long and several dozen feet wide.</p>

  <p>As soon as it took its shape, it shot up towards the shadowy creature.</p>

  <p>"Although your power is strangely potent, technique is garbage," Nicholas said in a mocking tone. "Utterly useless," he added, a look of great disdain on his face.</p>

  <p>The woman, unfazed, possessed Samuel's clone. To Nicholas, she was starting to become a big trouble, as she flew around the area. 'Since I can't defeat Zheng right now, I might as well kill this lady first, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>Truly, the force of primitive fear was a kind of strong power. It was actually much stronger than the internal momentum of other Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the woman only used it by simply transforming its form.</p>

  <p>'And that makes it virtually impossible to use against me, ' he thought, smirking.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As the shadow's huge hand slapped the long brown spear that was coming towards it, a few cracks appeared in its palm. At the same time, however, the long brown spear was rapidly disintegrating.</p>

  <p>The way the woman used the force of primitive fear was incredibly basic, not to mention weak and useless. Well, that was because she had paid all her attention to the True Demon Body all these years. She hadn't studied the force of primitive fear all that much.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the brown spear broke into pieces and dissolved into oblivion.</p>

  <p>Without anything stopping it, the shadow launched its attack: it was going to squish the woman with its huge, bare hands.</p>

  <p>Swish!</p>

  <p>Samuel's clone, who was brandishing the Spear of Supreme Harmony, was about to launch a counter attack against the giant shadow when the woman suddenly exclaimed, "Let's go!"</p>

  <p>"But..." Samuel's clone hesitated.</p>

  <p>Even if they tried to escape once again, Nicholas would know where they were going to and then kill them. For him, it was meaningless to escape this void.</p>

  <p>Despite thinking that, the clones obeyed the woman. Although entities like him had the same wisdom and mental capacity as real human beings, their behavior was still tethered to the woman. Because of this, clones like him were considered inferior to the Holy Beings themselves. That was the reason why the clones were all annihilated except him.</p>

  <p>Although Samuel's clone was hesitating, he pulled out his spear and opened a space channel. Then he left with the woman through the channel.</p>

  <p>Just as Samuel's clone had expected, the moment they came out of the space channel, a giant shadowy hand was waiting for them. This time, however, it was already so close that they had no room to dodge it.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>The woman and Samuel's clone were hit hard. The power of the shadow giant was immense. The two fell into the void, both of them bleeding from fresh injuries.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>Ordered by Nicholas, the huge shadow chased after them in order to hit them once again.</p>

  <p>At that moment, many thin brown lines appeared out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>They then became intertwined, forming a huge web, which blocked the new attack of huge palm.</p>

  <p>Crack, crack, crack...</p>

  <p>The palm impatiently swept over the thin brown lines to get them out of the way, but every time it did that, deep gashes appeared on it.</p>

  <p>The lines slowed the speed of the palm incredibly, and so the woman and Samuel's clone managed to escape.</p>

  <p>With a somersault, the woman was back on her feet. She narrowed her eyes and found that it was Sword Chen who helped her.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen did not want to help the woman, but he could see that Samuel's clone and the Spear of Supreme Harmony were extremely important to defeat Nicholas. That was the reason why Nicholas wanted to kill the woman.</p>

  <p>Because of that, at that critical moment, he had no choice but to help the woman.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Sword Chen was not able to stop the giant shadow for good.</p>

  <p>It once again raised its hand and launched an attack towards the woman.</p>

  <p>This time, however, she didn't dare to ask Samuel's clone to use the Grand Teleportation, which would only make her more passive.</p>

  <p>But then she still was unable to withstand the attack against her. With a slight frown, her eyes became filled with dread and anxiety.</p>

  <p>Just then, Sword Chen shouted, "Black water! Draw the force of primitive fear in the black water and give it to me!"</p>

  <p>He had already inserted one hundred and twenty-eight long swords at the bottom of the black water but he could only use a small part of the force of primitive fear.</p>

  <p>That was why he was trying his best to produce the most terrifying power of force of primitive fear. He had already managed to perfectly mix the force of primitive fear with the Emotion Closing Godly Way over the years.</p>

  <p>If he could use all the force of primitive fear, he would be able to maximize its power.</p>

  <p>Of course, the woman was also well aware of that.</p>

  <p>After all, she had used over a hundred thousand Sword Chen's clones, and she had used the force of primitive fear to reinforce the strength of those clones.</p>

  <p>So she did not hesitate when Sword Chen made the request.</p>

  <p>More than one hundred vortexes suddenly appeared in the originally calm black water. The force of primitive fear contained in it was constantly poured into the one hundred and twenty-eight long swords of Sword Chen.</p>
