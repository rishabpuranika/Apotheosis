<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pulled the spear out, swinging it at Yates's head dangerously as he stepped forward.</p>

  <p>The latter, however, was completely dumbfounded. He stood in shock and forgot to defend himself. All his arrogance, his resolve, and his confidence melted before Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>But suddenly, just as the spear was about to slam into Yates, a surge of blue vitality contorted into a protective shield, standing erect before him.</p>

  <p>The spear hit the blue shield heavily with a clang.</p>

  <p>The shield was so strong that it did not crack, instead, its strong counterforce had the spear shooting back to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng moved aside to avoid the spear and immediately took advantage of the counter-force to throw the weapon at the shield once again.</p>

  <p>Clang, clang, clang!</p>

  <p>The spear hit the shield seven or eight times in a row, but its blue surface did not crack. Luo Zheng tossed the weapon to the ground as his lips twisted into an unruffled smirk. His eyes shot to the man behind Yates.</p>

  <p>The man behind Yates, responsible for blocking Zheng's attack, was James Mo— Yates's father.</p>

  <p>"Kid, you've already one-upped my son. Why do you keep attacking him?" James's voice was as frosty as ice.</p>

  <p>Admittedly, James admired Luo Zheng a lot, for he possessed a strength far beyond the first grade of nature level that he belonged to. In the future, Luo Zheng would continue to progress leaps and bounds, and perhaps no one would be able to stop his rise.</p>

  <p>However, he was also on Nory's side, which meant that he was James's enemy. James could not let Luo Zheng have his way.</p>

  <p>"Why not? All his attacks against me were lethal to my life, so why can't I attack him in return? As a father, you have let your son so loose that he has become vicious to others! How do you still have the face to blame me? It's laughable!" Zheng's words were derisive, and a lop-sided smile rested on his lips.</p>

  <p>James flushed with embarrassments. How dared Luo Zheng insult the Mo family in front of so many guests?</p>

  <p>They might not be big names, and most of them were not even refiners, but they had a reputation and entertained close relationships with the Mo clan.</p>

  <p>James clenched his jaw in rage. He was a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm. He would not just stand here and be called names by a boy who was only at the first grade of nature level!</p>

  <p>"It's none of your business how I educate my son! How dare you run amok in my own house! My son hasn't done anything to you." As an elder, James tried to sound reasonable and wise, but his tone betrayed his anger. Deep inside, he couldn't wait to get his hands on the flippant young man.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't done anything? And I'm the one troubling people? You are ridiculous. I came to this gathering because I was invited by my friend, Nory. How is that running amok? It's your son who has been looking to find trouble with Nory from the beginning. And you! You took Nory's heirloom and refused to return it to him. You're the head of your clan, so isn't it you who is running amok by condoning that kind of behavior?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng snapped at him sharply, his nostrils flaring with anger.</p>

  <p>Nory gaped at Luo Zheng. Listening to his friend defend him, his heart soared.</p>

  <p>He was lucky he could count Luo Zheng as a buddy.</p>

  <p>Nory almost burst into tears before the audience.</p>

  <p>Who had a spine? Luo Zheng did!</p>

  <p>Even while facing a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm, he never yielded.</p>

  <p>Nory had endured the slights of the Mo clan for years. Finally, it was Luo Zheng who had relayed his troubles before them.</p>

  <p>As that thought came to him, Nory took two steps forward. He yelled,</p>

  <p>"Uncle James! Several years ago, you told me that my father was shot to death by a number of arrows, but that you didn't witness his death. How is it then that the blood jade bracelet, strangely appeared on your hand?</p>

  <p>What all have you been hiding from me? Is it you who is my father's killer?"</p>

  <p>Ever since Nory saw the blood jade bracelet, he had been prevailed by that notion.</p>

  <p>Before that, he had never suspected anything Uncle James said.</p>

  <p>But Uncle James did imply that he was not with Nory's father when the latter died. So how could the bracelet be in his possession?</p>

  <p>Why did Uncle James lie?</p>

  <p>If he didn't kill his father, why would he need to hide the truth?</p>

  <p>James was several decades old and knew well how to handle such a situation. A crafty sneer emerged on his face. "Nory, I can't answer that, but you can go to your father's tomb and ask him how he died!"</p>

  <p>"Fine, let's accept that you can't give me an answer. But why did you have the blood jade bracelet with you?" Nory pressed him impatiently.</p>

  <p>James realized that he could no longer avoid the question regarding the bracelet.</p>

  <p>However, he had no plans of answering it. He gazed at Nory coldly.</p>

  <p>"Such a brat! I've been nothing but good to you, and is this how you repay me?"</p>

  <p>"Good to me?" Nory revealed a bitter smile, "Haha, James, I'm young and cowardly. You knew that and took advantage of it. But did you stop to think that I'm not a fool? As the eldest son of the Mo clan, when was I ever treated the way Yates was? There is no servant in this house who shows an iota of respect to me! If you were good to me, how would they dare behave that way? It's all at your behest! You want to force me out of the Mo clan— "</p>

  <p>"You spoiled wretch! Hold your tongue! I'm going to give you the lesson your father would have wanted to teach you!" James interrupted Nory, refusing to let him give voice to his suspicions. He swept a hand and his blue life vitality transformed into a long, blue sword in his hand.</p>

  <p>Even before the sword could take its shape, he had it already brandished at Nory.</p>

  <p>Did he really want to teach Nory a lesson? No! He was going to take his life away!</p>

  <p>A majority of the members of the Mo clan had assembled here for the party.</p>

  <p>But no one dared to stand up for Nory and say something to bring a stop to James's intentions.</p>

  <p>Nory felt his heart sink at their indifference. At this moment, he held no sentimentality for this family.</p>

  <p>"Hey, you don't deserve to be Nory's uncle. You have no right to educate him!" As the long, blue sword rushed at Nory, Luo Zheng punched right on the sword with the purple-black shadow of his fist.</p>

  <p>As his fist hit it, Luo Zheng brought the star power of the demonic life vitality to the forefront, making it explode.</p>

  <p>Rumble!</p>

  <p>The starlight exploded into innumerable beams of destructive energy, devouring the long, blue sword of James in the blink of an eye.</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng block his offense, James pressed his lips together in irritation. The boy was such a nuisance!</p>

  <p>The reason why he didn't attack Luo Zheng, even though the latter attempted to kill his son, was that he had a few misgivings about him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was much stronger than other disciples who were of similar age.</p>

  <p>James wondered who Zheng's master was, otherwise, how could he have gained such strength?</p>

  <p>He knew he had to be careful in dealing with Luo Zheng, so he hadn't charged at him earlier. Besides, today's failure could ultimately prove to be a positive experience for Yates. At least he would understand that there were better and more powerful people than him in the outside world, which perhaps would urge him to work harder on himself.</p>

  <p>But now, Luo Zheng had attacked James himself. James had intended to teach Nory a lesson, but Luo Zheng dared to put an end to it.</p>

  <p>James snorted with contempt. "Do you really think you'll pay no price for standing against me?"</p>

  <p>As he voiced out his threat, bursts of blue flames surged out of his body.</p>

  <p>His life vitality burned ferociously.</p>

  <p>How terrible was the momentum of his Illuminating Soul Realm power!</p>

  <p>It flickered in the air menacingly, and those standing close to him were forced to retreat several steps back.</p>

  <p>The burning life vitality danced in the air and began to transform into a great many weapons.</p>

  <p>Machetes, swords, sticks, spears, and so on.</p>

  <p>At the reveal of James's true strength, worry gnawed in Zheng's gut.</p>

  <p>He hadn't imagined James's life vitality could transform into so many weapons. James seemed to have a complex intellect. Abruptly, the demonic life vitality in Zheng's arm began to fuse into his Phoenix Crystal.</p>

  <p>James was stronger compared to Hugh...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had been aware that helping Nory meant declaring war against James, but everything happened so fast that he didn't have the time to meditate on his actions.</p>

  <p>Still, he resolved to face this head-on.</p>

  <p>What the Mo clan did to Nory made his blood boil. Today, he must avenge Nory, no matter what happened next.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng raised the fist that carried the purple-black shadow of his demonic life vitality. Faced with a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm, he must give his best and not employ any carelessness.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Wurth frowned, knowing it would be hard for Luo Zheng to defeat a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm, given his current nature level.</p>

  <p>Wruth slipped his hand under his clothes and put one finger on the token on his chest, stroking it. An invisible wave began spreading out.</p>

  <p>Unbeknownst to him, someone else had taken up the same action. That person, of course, was Nina.</p>

  <p>'This guy! He really runs headfirst into trouble at every turn. How is it that he started a battle against the clan leader, at whose house he only came for a meal?' Nina curled her lips sardonically. However, she was still pretty proud of what her love had done.</p>

  <p>After all, how many nature creatures were willing to lock horns with a master of the Illuminating Soul Realm?</p>

  <p>So far, she only knew of Luo Zheng who had the courage to do that.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he was only at the first grade of nature level.</p>

  <p>With further training, he would be promoted to the ultimate grade of nature level, and be able to defeat every refiner of the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>She knew Luo Zheng was capable of doing that, but it still worried her.</p>

  <p>James was not weak. He was a lot more powerful than Hugh.</p>

  <p>At once, she unclasped the Immediate Messenger in her hand to ensure Zheng's safety.</p>

  <p>The Imperial City in the Burning Sky Empire occupied a massive area, but it took only a second for the masters of the Illuminating Soul Realm to arrive.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, James launched an attack at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>His cultivation method was superior. Usually, refiners could transform their life vitality into only one weapon.</p>

  <p>If they preferred to use swords, their life vitality morphed into swords.</p>

  <p>Most of them chose to do so to improve their strengths.</p>

  <p>As for Hugh, he preferred to transform his life vitality into a Five-clawed Golden Dragon.</p>

  <p>In contrast, James transformed his life vitality into a number of weapons.</p>

  <p>Bola, chopper, and darts of different shapes and sizes...</p>

  <p>The various weapons were pitched into the air. They followed their trajectories and hurtled at Luo Zheng from all directions, allowing him no room to escape.</p>
