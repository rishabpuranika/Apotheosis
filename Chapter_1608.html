<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Frosty Cage made from the Lofty Wood opened up like the cavernous mouth of a monster and swallowed the flame kitten.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng stopped and turned back to see if his plan had worked.</p>

  <p>Everyone nervously stared at the Frosty Cage.</p>

  <p>"Meow!" the little flame kitten let out a mournful cry. It crashed around in the cage and tried desperately to break free from it.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Janet wore a solemn expression on her face.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Wood had completely fused with her, so she had to continuously control it and maintain it to form and sustain the cage. At the same time, she also had to delve into her supply of life vitality and turn the cage into ice, in order to weaken the Fire Law's power around the flame kitten's body.</p>

  <p>According to the determining characteristics of the five elements, the power of Fire Law was supposed to overcome the power of Wood Law.</p>

  <p>However, the Lofty Wood was an extraordinary substance, and it wasn't affected by the fire at all.</p>

  <p>However, the flame kitten was a Law Creature, which had been born from the lava, and it was exceptionally powerful. Even with Janet's current strength, it was extremely difficult for her to imprison the creature, and it threatened to break free!</p>

  <p>Meow!</p>

  <p>Due to the flame kitten's violent struggle, the Frosty Cage was constantly being deformed, but it didn't break apart. After all, it had been formed from the Lofty Wood, which was a branch of the legendary Lofty Tree, and it was known for its great resilience. No matter how hard the flame kitten struggled, it failed to break the cage.</p>

  <p>However, the pressure that Janet had to endure grew greater and greater.</p>

  <p>Her face paled from exhaustion because of the arduous task, which added to her fragile beauty.</p>

  <p>However, the little flame kitten remained full of energy, as it continued to struggle more and more violently within the confines of the cage.</p>

  <p>With a flip of her hand, Janet swiftly took out a life vitality jade and crushed it to absorb the life vitality within it. In this short time span, most of the life vitality within her body had already been consumed! She was growing weaker, while the flame kitten remained fearsome.</p>

  <p>She hadn't expected that the amount of life vitality which she consumed to bind this little flame kitten would be so massive. It was far greater than what was required for a battle!</p>

  <p>Seeing her titanic struggle, Zheng quickly waved his hand and drew out a strand of chaotic energy from within his body. He transformed this into a burst of cold energy and ordered it to quickly bind with the flame kitten in the cage.</p>

  <p>Other warriors who had grasped the Ice Law also followed his example in a bid to help Janet tame the little flame kitten.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Under their continuous attacks using the Ice Law, the flame kitten's movements grew lethargic and became slower and slower, and its shrill cries gradually died down. The flames on its body were rapidly being snuffed out, and its beautiful fur, which was formed by fire, also became lackluster and matted.</p>

  <p>After a while, the flame kitten finally stopped struggling altogether, and it quietly lay down within the Frosty Cage.</p>

  <p>"We did it!"</p>

  <p>Janet sighed with relief as she raised her hand to wipe the sweat from her brow. It had been too great a task for her to tame the flame kitten on her own. If the other warriors hadn't lent their assistance, she would've failed to capture and tame the flame kitten, even with the cage formed from the Lofty Wood.</p>

  <p>"So you really managed to catch this thing. You are crazy!" Coleman stared blankly at the flame kitten in the Frosty Cage, though he kept his distance. He seemed to have been scared of the flame kitten earlier, so he had stayed far away from the group when they had all endeavored to tame the creature.</p>

  <p>Anyway, since his talent was in body refining, he couldn't have helped them even if he wanted.</p>

  <p>Janet slowly walked up to the Frosty Cage and stopped beside it, while she watched the flame kitten hibernating inside the cage.</p>

  <p>The little creature was weak from its injuries sustained in the struggle, and its innocent eyes were fearfully narrowed as it peered closely at her.</p>

  <p>"Poor little guy," Janet said sympathetically and then shook her head and sighed. She instantly felt sorry for what she had done to it.</p>

  <p>"The Illusion Battlefield is constructed by the rules of the heavens, and everything here is just a projection of the heavens. This is all just a dream, and when the Illusion Battlefield closes, they will all disappear.</p>

  <p>You don't have to feel sorry about it. After all, it's not real," Jeffrey offered in an attempt to console her.</p>

  <p>Janet knew he was right. The principles governing the Illusion Battlefield and the Illusion Space were similar, so these creatures here were not necessarily real.</p>

  <p>"Meow!" the little flame kitten let out a weak and pitiful cry.</p>

  <p>Although Janet knew that it might just be an illusion, she still couldn't help but feel a surge of pity for the now-helpless creature.</p>

  <p>However, she knew that they had no other choice but to use this little creature as bait, if they wanted to successfully pass through the lava lake.</p>

  <p>"The next step is to use this flame kitten to lure the Lava Giant to us,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said. "But how will we get it over there?"</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant was still quite a distance away from them. It would be meaningless if they simply threw the kitten at the Lava Giant and let it eat the creature. The key was to attract the Lava Giant to them, and away from the lava lake.</p>

  <p>Although they had managed to finally capture the flame kitten, they didn't know if Zheng's plan would really work. This was an experimental way to find a way to pass through the lava lake unscathed.</p>

  <p>"I can do it," Janet replied as she stared at the kitten with sympathy. She reached out her hand and grabbed the end of the Lofty Wood, while lifting the Frosty Cage from the ground with the other. She whispered to the little creature in a soft voice, "Please, help us with our plan, little kitten. I promise that I'll return you to the lake..."</p>

  <p>After that, Janet stretched out her hand and waved it lightly, while a tremendous strength accumulated in her.</p>

  <p>The Lofty Wood was like a part of her body, which could change its length freely.</p>

  <p>Under Janet's control, the Lofty Wood started to extend in the direction of the Lava Giant with the Frosty Cage hanging on its other end.</p>

  <p>One thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Two thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Three thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Four thousand feet.</p>

  <p>Five thousand feet.</p>

  <p>As the Lofty Wood grew longer and longer, the Frosty Cage also drew closer and closer to the Lava Giant.</p>

  <p>Janet held the Lofty Wood in her hand as it grew and ascended upwards.</p>

  <p>It looked like she was flying a kite! The Frosty Cage was slowly raised further and higher until it finally stopped right in front of the Lava Giant, like a carrot on a stick.</p>

  <p>However, although the Frosty Cage continued to hang suspended in front of the Lava Giant, the giant ignored the cage as if it was blind.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Zheng and the others all felt let down and their faces darkened.</p>

  <p>If they couldn't succeed at luring the Lava Giant to them, then they really didn't know how they could get through the lava lake.</p>

  <p>"Let me try again!"</p>

  <p>Janet shook her hand and the vibration was transmitted along the wood to the Frosty Cage at the other end of the Lofty Wood. The cage started to sway violently from left to right.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the little flame kitten suddenly let out a soft mournful cry.</p>

  <p>Bump!</p>

  <p>Immediately, the Lava Giant, which was as tall as a mountain, opened its molten eyes, as if it had been awakened by the kitten's piteous sound.</p>

  <p>When it clearly saw the little flame kitten dangling in front of it, the giant suddenly opened its huge mouth and reached hungrily for the little creature!</p>

  <p>"Come back to me!"</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Janet had secretly sworn to herself that she could not in good conscience let the Lava Giant devour the helpless little flame kitten. She ordered the Lofty Wood to quickly shrink and retract back to her.</p>

  <p>The Lava Giant let out a grievous moan of anger.</p>

  <p>Its huge body slowly turned around to follow the cage and the kitten, which were quickly moving out of its reach.</p>

  <p>Its gigantic arm swung out and grabbed for the Frosty Cage on top of the Lofty Wood. However, Janet quickly ordered the Lofty Wood to retreat even quicker, and the Lava Giant's huge hands closed on nothing but air!</p>

  <p>Howl! The Lava Giant let out a loud and frustrated roar.</p>

  <p>It lifted its one leg and took a thundering step forward, as goblets of lava dripped from its fiery form.</p>

  <p>BOOM!</p>

  <p>A loud sound rumbled and reverberated around the cave, as the ground shook violently. Zheng and the others momentarily struggled to find firm footing as the Lava Giant began its ponderous advance.</p>

  <p>The moment the Lava Giant had lifted its leg, lava had gathered at its feet to form a whirlpool, and once it took a step forward, its leg pierced through the blackened surface of the lava lake and caused waves of red hot lava to spread out quickly.</p>

  <p>This lava was different from normal lava. In normal volcanic craters, the lava was very thick and had a dark red color.</p>

  <p>However, the lava in this lake contained the rich power of both the Earth Law and Fire Law. It had a bright red color and it was not thick and sludgy, like normal lava; instead, it spread out at an extremely fast speed like water.</p>

  <p>"Retreat!"</p>

  <p>When Zheng and the others saw this new danger heading towards them, they realized that the lava posed as great a threat as the Lava Giant, and they all quickly retreated towards the back of the cave.</p>

  <p>No one wanted to come into contact with the swiftly advancing waves of lava, and even Zheng was fully alert at this moment.</p>

  <p>If this special lava could have refined his body and helped him improve, he would have been very willing to bathe in it. However, under these urgent circumstances, he wouldn't be so reckless as to accept the baptism of fire!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Janet also scrambled a retreat while she continued withdrawing the cage and the kitten at the same time.</p>

  <p>Although the Lava Giant was enormous and seemed to be moving at a snail's pace, its speed was in reality not slow. Every step it took covered a distance of more than 5000 feet! It took a long time for the giant to complete one stride, but it was gaining on them with the sheer breadth of its strides.</p>

  <p>At the same time, its giant arm swung forward, covering several thousand feet, and the group had to dodge a shower of molten lava that rained down amidst them, as it dripped off the giant. The Lava Giant smashed down heavily towards the little flame kitten who was fearfully screaming in the Frosty Cage!</p>
