<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Nelly believed that she would be totally invincible after Zheng was injured by the Blood Breaking Bite. Finally, it would be her time to shine!</p>

  <p>However, it never occurred to her that she would be in grave danger in the very next moment.</p>

  <p>A thought crossed her mind: 'The rumor is true.'</p>

  <p>No wonder the Dongfang Clan was so eager to enlist Zheng. One could have the Cross-world Theurgy only after they created a universe. If this was true, it meant that there was a possibility of a universe existing in the body of the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>There was no way it could be viable, could it?</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether this was possible or not, one thing was certain that the inner world of the anonymous man was very special. At least, it was the first time that this kind of a thing occurred in god knew how many divine eras.</p>

  <p>Maybe the reason why the Dongfang Clan wanted to take the anonymous man back was that they wanted to study him, and not simply because they admired his talent.</p>

  <p>The movements of the Long Vine Sword were very strange. The invisible power of the vines intertwined Nelly trapping her, and forcing her to use almost all her skills.</p>

  <p>"Shadow Escape!"</p>

  <p>Blood swelled in her eyes. Her speed more than doubled suddenly.</p>

  <p>Even though she was imprisoned by the dense vines released by the Long Vine Sword, she was still like a nimble butterfly, creating an unpredictable trajectory by constantly shuttling about. She was being followed by the Buddha Emperor Sword and the Heavenly Tooth Sword.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, Nelly was in great danger. The Buddha Emperor Sword had almost hit her on the head from the front, and the Heavenly Tooth Sword had left a bloody wound on her arm.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he paid close attention to the wound on his arm, and didn't fully engage the four swords.</p>

  <p>If he used the full extent of his mind power to control the Gods Killing Sword Array, Nelly would be in more pain.</p>

  <p>If Zheng could absorb the Blood Breaking Bite, imprint a mark on his opponent's body, and then drive the Buddha Emperor Sword to chase her all the way, the opponent would be in pursuit until she died.</p>

  <p>"But this theurgy seems to be more complicated. It should be a theurgy beyond two Godly Ways..." A golden light flickered in Zheng's eyes, while the light on the Infinity Ruler too continued dancing.</p>

  <p>Some moments later, the light on the ruler split into two parts, and one of these stopped at the Life Godly Way. Zheng had already absorbed the Life Godly Way in the Heavenly Han House, but the Life Godly Way hidden in the Blood Breaking Bite was a completely different theurgy.</p>

  <p>The second light stayed on another scale on which there was a small amount of red blood. It was the Murdering Godly Way!</p>

  <p>"Blood is a fundamental component of life energy. The Life Godly Way knows everything about living beings... The Murdering Godly Way is an extreme path of killing. Those who combine the two are indeed very clever," Zheng sighed as he interpreted the internal momentum. It was indeed very difficult to merge these two completely contradictory ways into one. There were too many outstanding talents in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Of course, he was not aware of the fact that the Blood Breaking Bite was originally created by Murphy.</p>

  <p>When he first arrived at the divine land, Zheng believed that the Emotion Closing Godly Way could be a match for other Godly Ways. But now, it looked like he was wrong. The Emotion Closing Godly Way was known as a forbidden Godly Way, although Zheng had no idea about the reason behind it. It was the best of the three thousand Godly Ways as it had incredible power. At least, he hadn't yet come across a Godly Way that was more powerful than the Emotion Closing Godly Way.</p>

  <p>However, the Emotion Closing Godly Way alone was not enough to crush these low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>If he succeeded in his own cultivation, he could take advantage of the Godly Ways he had mastered and study them carefully to try and see if he could create a powerful theurgy beyond all ways.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Zheng couldn't find a solution in the internal momentum. It seemed that the Blood Breaking Bite would not disappear until a specific period of time, which meant that Zheng was trapped in the place where he was.</p>

  <p>"But, Nelly seems to be unable to resist my attack too," Zheng said as he regarded Nelly in the distance with a faint smile on his lips. When he used all his thoughts to control the Gods Killing Sword Array, Nelly would experience greater pressure.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Tooth Sword, which had been chasing Nelly, suddenly turned around and flew away to the other side. Meanwhile the Buddha Emperor Sword was still attacking Nelly strongly. The two swords sandwiched her and soon blocked her right in the middle.</p>

  <p>"Fighting Nelly is easier than I expected. She is already the first in the low-rank True Gods. Maybe I can skip a rank, and challenge the mid-rank True Gods." Zheng gave her a smile. He didn't know why such a thought had occurred to him. Of course, he was just thinking about it. He had enough points now, and he had also completed the task given by Joy.</p>

  <p>It would be a big blow to him if he really got defeated by some mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>When Nelly was resisting the relentless vines, a powerful vine entangled around her delicate white ankle. As the first vine twined around her ankle, a second one followed naturally. Soon, Nelly was completely entwined in vines. At the same time, Zheng's two long swords were pointed at her, one in front of her and the other behind her.</p>

  <p>"It's over," Zheng said with a grin. He intended to kill her with the two long swords swiftly and without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Just when the Buddha Emperor Sword was about to slit her chest, Nelly suddenly burst into a cackle, and said, "Is it really over?"</p>

  <p>"Haha..."</p>

  <p>A gaping hole was created in her chest due to the impact of the Buddha Emperor Sword. The Heavenly Tooth Sword was like a saw, grinding on her physical body and tearing it apart.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a strange scene was unfolding.</p>

  <p>The blood that burst forth from Nelly's body did not fall to the ground, but instead gathered on her body. It seemed unwilling to leave.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, Nelly's flesh was completely shredded, and the blood flowing from her body enveloped her completely.</p>

  <p>"She's still alive? That's impossible!" Zheng murmured while staring at the bloody person in surprise. At least Zheng's victory was not determined in this arena.</p>

  <p>The blood on Nelly's misshapen figure was still slowly ebbing and swirling, and the originally blurred face gradually reformed to reveal Nelly's facial features. The blood above the head began forming the outline of her hair. An identical Nelly took shape, but she was made up entirely of blood.</p>

  <p>"This is the second time I have been forced to launch the Avenging Body in the Arena of Legends by member of the Han Clan," Nelly explained flatly.</p>

  <p>"Avenging Body?" Zheng inquired, as his eyebrows rose slightly.</p>

  <p>She had used the power of her Avenging Body the last time when she had a showdown with Liusu. Liusu's preternatural fire had burned across the skies, which had driven Nelly to a dead end. Before dying, she had performed the Avenging Body.</p>

  <p>It wasn't difficult to restore one's body with the Life Godly Way. Many True Gods who practiced the Life Godly Way could do this easily.</p>

  <p>However, the Avenging Body was not a new body. It was an indestructible body created using the body before death and was a way for revenge.</p>

  <p>Nelly attacked Liusu once she pushed out Nelly's Avenging Body. In the end Liusu was defeated and she ranked third in the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>If this was outside the Arena of Legends, Nelly's Avenging Body would also appear after she was killed. However, she could only use this skill once. Once the Avenging Body disappeared, Nelly would also die forever. Thus, this was a fatal tactic that could only be used once in her life.</p>

  <p>However, Nelly could use it again and again in the Arena of Legends. It turned out that she was taking advantage of the loopholes in it.</p>

  <p>"Shadow Escape!"</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>In an instant, Nelly turned into a blood light and zoomed toward Zheng at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>"Slash!"</p>

  <p>Sitting on the ground, Zheng gently lifted his finger. The Buddha Emperor Sword pierced through Nelly's blood body, but no matter how it went in and came out, or how many times he did it, it did not cause any harm to her.</p>

  <p>'If it's really just all blood, I don't think that any amount of strength that she unleashes will do any harm to me, ' Zheng speculated as he stared at Nelly's blood body.</p>

  <p>When Nelly was getting closer and closer to Zheng, he saw a faint blood light shining from the surface of her body. A strong power emitted from her body, and she went straight for Zheng.</p>

  <p>Unable to dodge, Zheng had no option but to take it head on.</p>

  <p>Zheng's body far exceeded the strength of an ordinary True God so he wouldn't fall behind!</p>

  <p>"Haha!"</p>

  <p>A muffled sound came through.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the violent impact, Nelly turned into a ball of blood and flew away. The blood began transforming again and finally took shape of Nelly's features. There was a hint of mockery on her face.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't suffer any major losses in this collision. Although Nelly's Avenging Body was very strong, it wouldn't cause much damage by crashing into Zheng's physical body. However, during the collision, he had been pushed back about three hundred feet.</p>

  <p>He sprayed blood across the three hundred feet because of the wound caused by the Blood Breaking Bite.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! What bad luck..." Zheng cursed! He was depressed now.</p>
