  <p>
</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang believed that she would be totally invincible after Luo Luo Zheng was injured by the Blood Breaking Bite. Finally, it would be her time to shine!</p>

  <p>However, it never occurred to her that she would be in grave danger in the very next moment.</p>

  <p>A thought crossed her mind: 'The rumor is true.'</p>

  <p>No wonder the Dongfang Clan was so eager to enlist Luo Luo Zheng. One could have the Cross-world token only after they created a universe. If this was true, it meant that there was a possibility of a universe existing in the body of the anonymous man.</p>

  <p>There was no way it could be viable, could it?</p>

  <p>Regardless of whether this was possible or not, one thing was certain that the inner world of the anonymous man was very special. At least, it was the first time that this kind of a thing occurred in god knew how many divine eras.</p>

  <p>Maybe the reason why the Dongfang Clan wanted to take the anonymous man back was that they wanted to study him, and not simply because they admired his talent.</p>

  <p>The movements of the Long Vine Sword were very strange. The invisible power of the vines intertwined Ling Shuang trapping her, and forcing her to use almost all her skills.</p>

  <p>"Shadow Escape!"</p>

  <p>Blood swelled in her eyes. Her speed more than doubled suddenly.</p>

  <p>Even though she was imprisoned by the dense vines released by the Long Vine Sword, she was still like a nimble butterfly, creating an unpredictable trajectory by constantly shuttling about. She was being followed by the Buddha Emperor Sword and the Heavenly Tooth Sword.</p>

  <p>In just a few seconds, Ling Shuang was in great danger. The Buddha Emperor Sword had almost hit her on the head from the front, and the Heavenly Tooth Sword had left a bloody wound on her arm.</p>

  <p>As for Luo Luo Zheng, he paid close attention to the wound on his arm, and didn't fully engage the four swords.</p>

  <p>If he used the full extent of his mind power to control the Gods Killing Sword Array, Ling Shuang would be in more pain.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng could absorb the Blood Breaking Bite, imprint a mark on his opponent's body, and then drive the Buddha Emperor Sword to chase her all the way, the opponent would be in pursuit until she died.</p>

  <p>"But this token seems to be more complicated. It should be a token beyond two Divine Dao..." A golden light flickered in Luo Zheng's eyes, while the light on the Infinity Ruler too continued dancing.</p>

  <p>Some moments later, the light on the ruler split into two parts, and one of these stopped at the Life Divine Dao. Luo Luo Zheng had already absorbed the Life Divine Dao in the Heavenly Han House, but the Life Divine Dao hidden in the Blood Breaking Bite was a completely different token.</p>

  <p>The second light stayed on another scale on which there was a small amount of red blood. It was the Murdering Divine Dao!</p>

  <p>"Blood is a fundamental component of life energy. The Life Divine Dao knows everything about living beings... The Murdering Divine Dao is an extreme path of killing. Those who combine the two are indeed very clever," Luo Luo Zheng sighed as he interpreted the internal momentum. It was indeed very difficult to merge these two completely contradictory ways into one. There were too many outstanding talents in the divine land.</p>

  <p>Of course, he was not aware of the fact that the Blood Breaking Bite was originally created by Murphy.</p>

  <p>When he first arrived at the divine land, Luo Luo Zheng believed that the Emotion Closing Divine Dao could be a match for other Divine Dao. But now, it looked like he was wrong. The Emotion Closing Divine Dao was known as a forbidden Divine Dao, although Luo Luo Zheng had no idea about the reason behind it. It was the best of the three thousand Divine Dao as it had incredible power. At least, he hadn't yet come across a Divine Dao that was more powerful than the Emotion Closing Divine Dao.</p>

  <p>However, the Emotion Closing Divine Dao alone was not enough to crush these low-rank True Gods.</p>

  <p>If he succeeded in his own cultivation, he could take advantage of the Divine Dao he had mastered and study them carefully to try and see if he could create a powerful token beyond all ways.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't find a solution in the internal momentum. It seemed that the Blood Breaking Bite would not disappear until a specific period of time, which meant that Luo Luo Zheng was trapped in the place where he was.</p>

  <p>"But, Ling Shuang seems to be unable to resist my attack too," Luo Luo Zheng said as he regarded Ling Shuang in the distance with a faint smile on his lips. When he used all his thoughts to control the Gods Killing Sword Array, Ling Shuang would experience greater pressure.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Tooth Sword, which had been chasing Ling Shuang, suddenly turned around and flew away to the other side. Meanwhile the Buddha Emperor Sword was still attacking Ling Shuang strongly. The two swords sandwiched her and soon blocked her right in the middle.</p>

  <p>"Fighting Ling Shuang is easier than I expected. She is already the first in the low-rank True Gods. Maybe I can skip a rank, and challenge the mid-rank True Gods." Luo Luo Zheng gave her a smile. He didn't know why such a thought had occurred to him. Of course, he was just thinking about it. He had enough points now, and he had also completed the task given by Joy.</p>

  <p>It would be a big blow to him if he really got defeated by some mid-rank True God.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>When Ling Shuang was resisting the relentless vines, a powerful vine entangled around her delicate white ankle. As the first vine twined around her ankle, a second one followed naturally. Soon, Ling Shuang was completely entwined in vines. At the same time, Luo Zheng's two long swords were pointed at her, one in front of her and the other behind her.</p>

  <p>"It's over," Luo Luo Zheng said with a grin. He intended to kill her with the two long swords swiftly and without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Just when the Buddha Emperor Sword was about to slit her chest, Ling Shuang suddenly burst into a cackle, and said, "Is it really over?"</p>

  <p>"Haha..."</p>

  <p>A gaping hole was created in her chest due to the impact of the Buddha Emperor Sword. The Heavenly Tooth Sword was like a saw, grinding on her physical body and tearing it apart.</p>

  <p>At the same time, a strange scene was unfolding.</p>

  <p>The blood that burst forth from Nelly's body did not fall to the ground, but instead gathered on her body. It seemed unwilling to leave.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, Nelly's flesh was completely shredded, and the blood flowing from her body enveloped her completely.</p>

  <p>"She's still alive? That's impossible!" Luo Luo Zheng murmured while staring at the bloody person in surprise. At least Luo Zheng's victory was not determined in this arena.</p>

  <p>The blood on Nelly's misshapen figure was still slowly ebbing and swirling, and the originally blurred face gradually reformed to reveal Nelly's facial features. The blood above the head began forming the outline of her hair. An identical Ling Shuang took shape, but she was made up entirely of blood.</p>

  <p>"This is the second time I have been forced to launch the Avenging Body in the Arena of Legends by member of the Han Clan," Ling Shuang explained flatly.</p>

  <p>"Avenging Body?" Luo Luo Zheng inquired, as his eyebrows rose slightly.</p>

  <p>She had used the power of her Avenging Body the last time when she had a showdown with Han Liusu. Liusu's preternatural fire had burned across the skies, which had driven Ling Shuang to a dead end. Before dying, she had performed the Avenging Body.</p>

  <p>It wasn't difficult to restore one's body with the Life Divine Dao. Many True Gods who practiced the Life Divine Dao could do this easily.</p>

  <p>However, the Avenging Body was not a new body. It was an indestructible body created using the body before death and was a way for revenge.</p>

  <p>Ling Shuang attacked Han Liusu once she pushed out Nelly's Avenging Body. In the end Han Liusu was defeated and she ranked third in the Hall of True Gods.</p>

  <p>If this was outside the Arena of Legends, Nelly's Avenging Body would also appear after she was killed. However, she could only use this skill once. Once the Avenging Body disappeared, Ling Shuang would also die forever. Thus, this was a fatal tactic that could only be used once in her life.</p>

  <p>However, Ling Shuang could use it again and again in the Arena of Legends. It turned out that she was taking advantage of the loopholes in it.</p>

  <p>"Shadow Escape!"</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>In an instant, Ling Shuang turned into a blood light and zoomed toward Luo Luo Zheng at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>"Slash!"</p>

  <p>Sitting on the ground, Luo Luo Zheng gently lifted his finger. The Buddha Emperor Sword pierced through Nelly's blood body, but no matter how it went in and came out, or how many times he did it, it did not cause any harm to her.</p>

  <p>'If it's really just all blood, I don't think that any amount of strength that she unleashes will do any harm to me, ' Luo Luo Zheng speculated as he stared at Nelly's blood body.</p>

  <p>When Ling Shuang was getting closer and closer to Luo Luo Zheng, he saw a faint blood light shining from the surface of her body. A strong power emitted from her body, and she went straight for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Unable to dodge, Luo Luo Zheng had no option but to take it head on.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body far exceeded the strength of an ordinary True God so he wouldn't fall behind!</p>

  <p>"Haha!"</p>

  <p>A muffled sound came through.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the violent impact, Ling Shuang turned into a ball of blood and flew away. The blood began transforming again and finally took shape of Nelly's features. There was a hint of mockery on her face.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't suffer any major losses in this collision. Although Nelly's Avenging Body was very strong, it wouldn't cause much damage by crashing into Luo Zheng's physical body. However, during the collision, he had been pushed back about three hundred feet.</p>

  <p>He sprayed blood across the three hundred feet because of the wound caused by the Blood Breaking Bite.</p>

  <p>"Damn it! What bad luck..." Luo Luo Zheng cursed! He was depressed now.</p>
