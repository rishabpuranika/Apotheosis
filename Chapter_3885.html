  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Abstruse Energy World</p>

  <p>Some of the light dots froze in place, while some others continued to twirl and dance.</p>

  <p>It was surprisingly easy to express and illustrate some complicated things with light dots.</p>

  <p>For example, it only required less than forty light dots to construct the shape of a person.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there were some simple shapes that required innumerable light dots to create. For example, a rope was actually built by three to four hundred light dots.</p>

  <p>In the beginning, Geoffrey had wanted to record a guide of rules to help Ziya and the other warriors learn faster and adapt to the Abstruse Energy World more easily.</p>

  <p>After some lengthy efforts proved unsuccessful, Geoffrey chose to give up.</p>

  <p>No matter how omniscient and capable Ziya was, once he entered the Abstruse Energy World, he became as a child, knowing nothing about the workings of that world.</p>

  <p>Even though he had such astonishing wisdom, he was now like a three-year-old child trying to figure out the complicated light dots.</p>

  <p>Last time, after crossing the grassland, Geoffrey and Ziya had found another world similar in nature to chaos. Ziya had been very interested in it as if he had discovered a new continent. He became even more enthusiastic about the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>Since there was this second world, there must be a third and a fourth one...</p>

  <p>There were endless living creatures and clues in these worlds.</p>

  <p>After sealing off the Deleting Space, Ziya had urged Geoffrey to continue exploring the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>After bypassing the mountain in the world of poisonous mist, Geoffrey had continued to move forward. A narrow mountain path led upwards, and the terrain in front of him became rugged and difficult, which had caused Geoffrey to hesitate for a moment.</p>

  <p>Although Ziya was powerful, it would be difficult to deal with some of the strange creatures in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>But since he had come so far, Geoffrey didn't want to retreat. He was also fascinated by this strangely familiar world.</p>

  <p>After ascending the mountain path with gritted determination, Geoffrey prepared to go up to the mountainside when he suddenly noticed a pair of red eyes not far away, burning in a face like an ape's.</p>

  <p>The creature saw Geoffrey in the same instant, and it jumped out of the crevice that ran up the mountainside.</p>

  <p>This creature was tall and strong with slender but powerful arms. Gripping a big stick in its hands, it seemed to amble over with ill intentions. More importantly, there was more than one long-armed ape. Soon, more than ten long-armed apes jumped out from the crack in quick succession!</p>

  <p>The leading ape with long arms suddenly jumped and swung its big stick at Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>In the Abstruse Energy World, even these unintelligent creatures possessed a powerful and brutish strength, at least stronger than Geoffrey!</p>

  <p>Noticing that trouble was looming, Geoffrey pulled Ziya behind him to the front and patted him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>In the Abstruse Energy World, Geoffrey hadn't found a good way to communicate with Ziya yet.</p>

  <p>The two of them had agreed that if Geoffrey encountered a crisis that he couldn't solve, he would push Ziya ahead and pat him on the right shoulder to indicate he should act!</p>

  <p>When Ziya felt Geoffrey's pat, his heart sank. It meant that Geoffrey was in trouble!</p>

  <p>In this state, Ziya was as lost as a blind man.</p>

  <p>He couldn't use any theurgy, though he still possessed a powerful physical body and formidable strength.</p>

  <p>In front of him, a large mass of strange light dots that was quite indistinguishable swarmed over. Ziya simply stretched out his hands and hacked at the mass!</p>

  <p>He had practiced this movement countless times before!</p>

  <p>Now, finally, it came in handy this time!</p>

  <p>The tall and sturdy long-armed ape in the lead didn't take Ziya seriously.</p>

  <p>As it swung the wooden stick towards Ziya, a dull thud sounded, but Ziya's body did not move at all, like an iron tower. The ape didn't know that its blow with full strength was as nothing in Ziya's eyes.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Ziya's palms lashed out at the ape's shoulders. As the terrifying power was exerted on its body, the ape watched in horror as its bones broke, and its entire body became compressed and ripped to pieces by a huge force...</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was also overwhelmed by the sudden destruction of the long-armed ape.</p>

  <p>In the Abstruse Energy World, Ziya couldn't tell the strength of his opponent, so he had hit the ape with close to his full power, immediately smashing it to pieces.</p>

  <p>The bloody scene shocked the other long-armed apes in front of them.</p>

  <p>Although they were not evolved life-forms, they were not complete idiots either. The two human beings in front of them were obviously not warriors to trifle with. They produced strange screams and disappeared into the crack in the mountainside.</p>

  <p>Having scared off the long-armed apes, Geoffrey pulled Ziya along and followed after them into the crack through the mountainside.</p>

  <p>Not long after they entered the dark crack, a large cave appeared in front of them.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey's eyes gleamed with anticipation. 'Is this the third world?'</p>

  <p>With this in mind, Geoffrey would not retreat. Without hesitation, he entered the cave with Ziya in tow.</p>

  <p>The cave was not only very deep, but also massively wide. A large part of it was filled with the long-armed apes. These apes were obviously now terrified of Ziya. When Geoffrey and Ziya passed by, the long-armed apes curled up into a mass of trembling shapes.</p>

  <p>Of course, Geoffrey ignored them and went deeper into the cave.</p>

  <p>When the long-armed apes watched Geoffrey continue forward, their eyes filled with expectation and pity.</p>

  <p>Although their intelligence was only at a bestial level, they knew that they couldn't move deeper into the cave.</p>

  <p>All of the long-armed apes that had entered deeper into the cave before had never returned. It was an endless abyss. These two human beings would probably die if they entered!</p>

  <p>After they had walked thousands of feet along the cave, the space ahead of them suddenly changed significantly.</p>

  <p>The scattered dots of light quickly gathered in one direction, and the two of them quickly rematerialized as human shapes.</p>

  <p>"What attacked you just now? Where are we?"</p>

  <p>In front of Ziya was another huge space, but compared to the world of poisonous mist, this place was even more desolate, or phrased differently, it was completely void!</p>

  <p>Ziya and Geoffrey continued to use the Grand Teleportation technique. But regardless of how much distance they covered, they found no living beings.</p>

  <p>Not even a soil particle, or a blade of grass existed here. This was a completely empty world!</p>

  <p>The two of them tried to enter the Other Shore by way of the Truth of Godly Way, but this didn't work either. The Other Shore didn't exist at all...</p>

  <p>"It seems that this world is even worse off," said Ziya with a grim face.</p>

  <p>The previous world of poisonous mist had basically been destroyed. The fate of only one world didn't signify anything, but the world they discovered now was in the same situation, and it was completely destroyed. All things had been destroyed here, which meant that there was massive trouble looming. The chaos would probably fall into the same situation in the end.</p>

  <p>"Maybe the next world didn't suffer the same fate..." Geoffrey comforted.</p>

  <p>"I hope so. Geoffrey, please continue to lead the way," Ziya said with a grim smile. After being in the Deleting Space for so many years, Ziya had perfected the art of indifference, and he was not upset by much.</p>

  <p>After the two of them left the empty world, they continued to climb up the mountain path.</p>

  <p>After Geoffrey gripped the rope and dragged Ziya to climb over the rugged and endless mountains, he finally saw a strange scene.</p>

  <p>Standing in the distance, four huge black pillars had attracted Geoffrey's attention. Everything in the Abstruse Energy World became the size of miniscule insects compared to these four black pillars, hardly worth mentioning.</p>

  <p>Everything was small in terms of size compared to these, and the black pillars' aura was also massive in comparison.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey couldn't find words for this feeling, but at first sight of the black pillars, he paused in shock.</p>
