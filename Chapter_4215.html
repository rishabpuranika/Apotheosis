  <p>
</p>

  <p>Of all the features and theurgies of the Space Guiding Stone, the space ball was the most astonishing one.</p>

  <p>Since he hadn't even thought of analyzing the structure of the space ball, Luo Zheng was attacking the sphere blindly with the heavy sword.</p>

  <p>He also unleashed powerful sword radiance with every attack. However, that only caused a little bit of damage to the space ball.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng didn't get frustrated.</p>

  <p>Although the process was slow, he could see his progress. The first time he brandished his sword, a crack appeared on the space ball.</p>

  <p>When he launched his second attack, the crack expanded and reached a bit further.</p>

  <p>By his third hit, the entire sphere was looking like a spider's web of cracks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't going to give up now.</p>

  <p>He waved his sword for the fifth time, and the space ball broke into several tiny pieces.</p>

  <p>It had taken him just five blows to destroy the space ball.</p>

  <p>The second he succeeded in doing that, the golden coordinates turned black.</p>

  <p>When he noticed that the Snake Spirit King's coordinates had changed color, Luo Zheng waved his sword at them once again. "Let's end this." He smiled.</p>

  <p>'Without the protection of the space ball, I am sure that these coordinates will vanish after I hit them, ' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"Is it over?"</p>

  <p>"Is the damned Snake Spirit King finally going to die?"</p>

  <p>"What's going on with his coordinates? Why did they become pitch black?</p>

  <p>Is something going to happen?"</p>

  <p>The human spirits, the Monkey Masters, and the Bird Masters were all excited and nervous simultaneously as they stared at the sword radiance and the fight that seemed to be tipping in Luo Zheng's favor.</p>

  <p>Just as the sword radiance had reached the coordinates, a black blade suddenly popped out from them.</p>

  <p>The blade collided with the sword radiance and a loud metallic sound was heard.</p>

  <p>To everyone's immense surprise, the black blade immediately destroyed the sword radiance.</p>

  <p>Then a black snake slowly emerged from the coordinates. This was none other than the Snake Spirit King himself.</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King had become much smaller than before now, although he was slightly bigger than Sewell. Regardless of his size, his appearance had changed a lot.</p>

  <p>The snake's body had also turned pure black, just like the coordinates.</p>

  <p>Also, he was not just a snake now. He had grown a pair of locust's legs as sharp as a knife and a halberd-shaped spike was on his tail.</p>

  <p>"My king!"</p>

  <p>"Our king is still alive!"</p>

  <p>"Oh yeah!"</p>

  <p>The Snake Masters and the snake spirits had lost all hope upon seeing the space ball destroyed. They had been devoured by sorrow and despair at the thought that the Snake Spirit King could not come back to life now.</p>

  <p>What was more, Luo Zheng had taken out Sewell with a single strike. They were aware of what would happen to them if things didn't go their king's way.</p>

  <p>It was beyond their dreams that not only would the king be alive, but also come out to defend against Luo Zheng's moves.</p>

  <p>Naturally, they were thrilled.</p>

  <p>"Hang on! What is that?"</p>

  <p>"The Snake Spirit King has changed his form!"</p>

  <p>"He looks more powerful than before!"</p>

  <p>The people on the altar were surprised to see the improvements in the king's body.</p>

  <p>The now small-looking Snake Spirit King came down like a leaf and stood in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Hiss!</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King brought out his forked tongue.</p>

  <p>His golden, slated eyes were filled with a strong will of hatred. At the same time, there was also a hint of pleasure in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It looks like I should thank you for giving me such powers," the Snake Spirit King hissed.</p>

  <p>He could feel that he was much stronger than he had ever been before, even if his size did not betray it.</p>

  <p>There were no words which could describe the amount of his newly acquired strength.</p>

  <p>He had obtained a power that was much stronger than any creature of the main world had ever imagined of. His power was now of such magnitude that finding it was only possible in the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>However, he was displeased with the black light.</p>

  <p>'Since the black light possesses such strength, why didn't I get it earlier?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>"This power is not yours," Luo Zheng said, as if he had read his mind.</p>

  <p>With his extraordinary abilities to perceive his opponent, he easily saw that the Snake Spirit King was several times stronger than before now. He had a feeling that his opponent could easily pose a threat to him in this condition.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the heavy sword in Luo Zheng's hand shook slightly. But it was not his reaction of fear. Neither was it the sword's reaction of fear. The weapon was excited.</p>

  <p>As an entity from the fifth-grade world, it had once confronted and even lost to the power that the Snake Spirit King had newly acquired. And it had also managed to defeat that power and destroy it once before.</p>

  <p>And although it had won, the Deep Space had lost.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was no wonder that the sword was thrilled to meet this power again.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't matter whether it belongs to me or not. What matters is that you will..." As the Snake Spirit King spoke, he morphed into a huge black shadow and approached Luo Zheng. "Die at my hands," he continued.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The Snake Spirit King attacked Luo Zheng with his legs.</p>

  <p>"How is that even possible?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>'I can't believe this. The Snake Spirit King is fast enough for me to be unable to see his movements at all.</p>

  <p>How is that possible?</p>

  <p>I pride myself on being able to withstand and foresee attacks no matter how fast my opponent is.</p>

  <p>But the Snake Spirit King's speed is beyond my imagination. It's almost impossible for me to dodge his attack, ' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>He himself could not have stopped the attack but at that very moment, the irregular heavy sword in his hand began to move on its own.</p>

  <p>It gently came up to resist the Snake Spirit King's attacks as if it had a mind of its own.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng wasn't doing anything, but his hand was waving the heavy sword.</p>

  <p>This was not something he could control.</p>

  <p>Whoever saw them was shocked by what was happening, including Luo Zheng himself.</p>

  <p>His right hand, which was holding the irregular sword was nowhere to be seen, and so was the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>All anyone could see was two unnoticeable shadows intertwined and hitting each other non-stop. Meanwhile, metallic sounds reached their ears. In the blink of an eye, the heavy sword had gone countless rounds with the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>"They are so fast!" Fuxi remarked in surprise.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess was staring at Luo Zheng with a trace of worry in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Something is wrong. It looks like Luo Zheng is at a loss and his hand is out of his control!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is..." the Primeval Lord of Heaven responded.</p>

  <p>"Master Corbett, do you have any idea what's going on with them? Have you ever seen the Snake Spirit King in such a form?" the Snake Goddess asked in a respectful tone.</p>

  <p>Corbett looked at the scene and surveyed it with a frown. "I've met someone with the power that the Snake Spirit King is using. I was in Deep Space at that time," he replied.</p>

  <p>The leaders of the Four Spirits Sect had been rather keen on exploring the Deep Space in the past. They had gone far and wide.</p>

  <p>After all, the ancestry-level bloodline and the holy pillars of the Four Spirits Sect themselves had originated from the Deep Space. It was known to everyone that there were many amazing things out there.</p>

  <p>As Kincaid's personal servant, Corbett had been lucky enough to enter the Deep Space once.</p>

  <p>"Although the place I went to with my master is only the outermost part of the Deep Space, it was still full of dangers. We ran into a black locust there. It had a pair of legs as sharp as knives. The aura it emitted was quite similar to the one the Snake Spirit King is emitting right now," Corbett told them.</p>

  <p>"Which means the new power that he has acquired is most likely from the Deep Space?" the Primeval Lord of Heaven remarked with a vacant expression. "Hang on. That also means the power of the Snake Spirit King is now much better than that of any creature in the entire main world?"</p>

  <p>Corbett nodded his head. "Most likely!" he confirmed.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi and the others gasped in astonishment.</p>

  <p>They had clearly heard the conversation between Luo Zheng and the Snake Spirit King just now.</p>

  <p>'The Snake Spirit King has got some new power from someone that is not of this world.</p>

  <p>Who gave it to him? When did it happen? Was it really some powerful being from the Deep Space?' A million questions ran through their minds.</p>

  <p>They had initially thought that the battle would come to an end as soon as the Snake Spirit King died. But that assumption had turned out to be wrong. Now, things were looking to be more complicated than they had imagined.</p>

  <p>Clung! Clung! Clung!</p>

  <p>On the other side, crisp sounds would continuously ring out around Luo Zheng and the Snake Spirit King.</p>

  <p>Under the control of the irregular heavy sword, Luo Zheng was brandishing it and resisting the attacks of the Snake Spirit King involuntarily. Suddenly, the Snake Spirit King made a sly move, and Luo Zheng staggered, almost falling down due to the heavy sword.</p>

  <p>However, he knew what he had to do. No matter what, he held on to the sword tightly and didn't drop it.</p>

  <p>Although the sword was incredibly strong, it needed the ancestry-level bloodline to provide it with the energy it needed to continue fighting.</p>

  <p>Once he dropped the sword, it would immediately run out of energy within ten seconds. Maybe even less since it was facing the Snake Spirit King's attacks. And then, Luo Zheng would be ripped into bits by the Snake Spirit King.</p>
