<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3418 The Energy Levels </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>If the three brothers from the Divine Farmer race entered the magic array, it would be all the Taiyi Heaven Palace disciples could do to watch them helplessly.</p>

  <p>There, they could safely refine the Chaotic Source Spirits and even give the extras to other people of their race.</p>

  <p>In the state of the Shadow Realm, the brothers moved very slowly.</p>

  <p>But no matter how much the Taiyi Heaven Palace people attacked them, they remained unaffected. It was only a matter of time before they entered the array.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, Feng Ge, and the others used a number of methods to attack them, but to no avail. Everyone's faces fell.</p>

  <p>"It's no use!" The tallest of the brothers burst into laughter as he boasted.</p>

  <p>"Your energy levels are not nearly high enough to deflate the Shadow Realm," murmured Chaim, who remained relatively calm.</p>

  <p>"What energy levels?" Feng Ge asked with a long face.</p>

  <p>For a moment, Chaim examined the brothers before continuing, "All the forces in the chaos can be regarded as the flow of energy. But the energy itself can vary from high to low."</p>

  <p>Although Chaim wasn't an expert, he knew the different energy levels.</p>

  <p>Life vitality was the lowest level of energy. All warriors in the Source World and creatures in the inner worlds could easily use it.</p>

  <p>When condensed to its extreme, life vitality became the Divine Dao. Its internal momentum then turned into the second level of energy, flowing much faster than the first.</p>

  <p>The power of the Other Shore Tokens belonged to the third level of energy? the most popular one among masters in the Source World.</p>

  <p>But the Other Shore Tokens had all sorts of strange abilities. Those of mysterious type, most especially, could reach higher energy levels. The Shadow Realm wasn't particularly difficult to deflate so long as one could touch or even just affect it. If anyone managed to do so, the realm would perish instantly.</p>

  <p>Some Other Shore Tokens could boast about unique abilities, including deflating the Shadow Realm.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the Taiyi Heaven Palace disciples present carried no such power. All they could do was watch as the three brothers slowly drifted away.</p>

  <p>Now, not only the disciples but also the team leaders at the gate of the Chaotic Source World, including Qiu Yinhe and Winchell, were angry.</p>

  <p>The Chaotic Source Spirits they had just obtained were snatched away by the Divine Farmer race, after all. Of course, they were enraged.</p>

  <p>The leader of the Divine Farmer race gave Qiu Yinhe a mocking smile. This time, ten members of the Divine Farmer race could undergo the Chaotic Source Reinforcement. How could they resist being so smug?</p>

  <p>Just as the three brothers moved twenty feet away, Luo Zheng and Yan came from the other side.</p>

  <p>They had just sealed the Eye of Will together. Seeing that the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace seemed both murderous and helpless, Luo Zheng frowned in surprise. "What happened?"</p>

  <p>"They took away our Chaotic Source Spirits!" Feng Ge responded angrily.</p>

  <p>"Really?" Luo Zheng's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>He gently flicked the long Snow Sword, making a beam of cold light shoot toward the three brothers.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The sword radiance instantly pierced through the three men's bodies, leaving no damage at all.</p>

  <p>"This brat really thought he could hurt us!"</p>

  <p>"How stupid!"</p>

  <p>"The disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace are mostly ignorant. Forgive them!"</p>

  <p>The trio seemed even prouder than they were before. They didn't seem to be in a rush from the very beginning. Once they saw Luo Zheng, they turned around and moved toward him. It was clear that they were trying to provoke him.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you can't deflate the Shadow Realm with normal methods," Chaim prompted. "But it is said that the Shadow Realm itself is quite fragile. It can be disturbed fairly easily because the Dark Realm Stone from the temple in Stage Thirteen is of the lowest level."</p>

  <p>"So what? You can't destroy the Dark Realm Stone no matter what level it's at," one of the brothers snorted.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brow raised as a red light flashed in his right eye. He forced fear to rush toward the trio.</p>

  <p>"The force of fear?"</p>

  <p>"Unbelievable!"</p>

  <p>For a moment, Luo Zheng's power startled them.</p>

  <p>But it still didn't manage to disturb the Shadow Realm. It went right through the trio's bodies.</p>

  <p>Yan, standing next to Luo Zheng, frowned slightly. The crimson shadow of Snake Goddess began emitting from her body. Thin red antennas shot toward the three brothers, but to no avail.</p>

  <p>"There's a huge gap in energy levels. It's too difficult to deflate the Shadow Realm like this," Chaim sighed in defeat.</p>

  <p>"The energy levels?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's gaze froze.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the first time he had heard of energy levels. In order to break Nicholas' Furnace of Dark and Light back in the divine land, he had used the Truth Crystal.</p>

  <p>It could break the furnace because its energy level was higher than that of the latter.</p>

  <p>"Just give it up, Luo Zheng. Let's look for other Chaotic Source Spirits instead,"</p>

  <p>Dorothy suggested.</p>

  <p>The members of several races like the Jin Wu and the Divine Farmer race were still fighting against the largest Chaotic Source Spirit. It was troublesome killing off any Chaotic Source Spirit, but it was better to go after another one than to waste time there.</p>

  <p>Even Feng Ge had looked to the other side to look for a new target.</p>

  <p>The three brothers of the Divine Farmer race were smug at this point. When they walked over before Luo Zheng's eyes, the latter gently reached out his hand and conjured a small green cubic crystal onto his palm.</p>

  <p>It drew the attention of the trio.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng was at the True God Realm, the crystal was used as a powerful tool to resist enemy attacks.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng didn't have enough blood of the Chaos Ancient God, so he couldn't produce any more Truth Crystals. As a result, the pure power of the Falling Star Palm wasn't quite enough.</p>

  <p>The trio had no idea about this Truth Crystal, but they didn't perceive any special kind of power from it. It didn't faze them in the least.</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng lowered his hand, a green vortex appeared above their heads.</p>

  <p>It continued swirling until a ray of green starlight fell over them.</p>

  <p>Seeing the power of the Falling Star Palm, Luo Zheng smiled bitterly within.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it was too weak with the use of only one Truth Crystal.</p>

  <p>When the others saw the starlight, they didn't take it seriously either. It was far weaker than their own strength.</p>

  <p>But when the warriors at the gate of the Chaotic Source World saw the green energy, their expressions hardened.</p>

  <p>"This is?"</p>

  <p>"The energy of truth level?"</p>

  <p>"It's weak, but it's genuine."</p>

  <p>Most of the leaders had figured out the energy level of the Falling Star Palm.</p>

  <p>When Qiu Yinhe saw it, his jaw slacked a bit in shock. Subconsciously, he looked over at Winchell.</p>

  <p>They definitely hadn't expected Luo Zheng to be carrying such a trick under his sleeve.</p>

  <p>What did Luo Zheng have to do with the Chaos Ancient God?</p>

  <p>Standing atop the snowy mountain, Fuxi kept his expression calm when he saw the green light from the Falling Star Palm. He had already known about it since he was at the bottom of the chaos.</p>

  <p>It wasn't a surprise to see Luo Zheng use such a move to get rid of the Shadow Realm.</p>
