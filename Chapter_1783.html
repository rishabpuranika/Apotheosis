<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1783 The Powerful Sword Strike </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>Preston smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>As a Spirit Transformation Realm martial artist, he had produced a massive number of living creatures in his inner world. The proof of it was a small divine kingdom with several third-grade sacred places where countless creatures still lived.</p>

  <p>Just now, a massive calamity had erupted in his inner world.</p>

  <p>He had cruelly disintegrated all living beings and returned them to the life vitality.</p>

  <p>Houses, buildings, roads, lakes, wolves, snakes, tigers, leopards, and any other vicious beasts in his inner world? none of them were spared.</p>

  <p>Some of the Virtual Tribulation Realm and Life and Death Realm warriors had also been restored to the life vitality by him.</p>

  <p>These creatures were deeply unwilling at the moment. They did not know what was happening outside of this world, nor did they know that the master of this inner world was undergoing a life and death crisis.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he had no choice but to sacrifice them one by one.</p>

  <p>When some warriors built their inner worlds, they sometimes developed bonds with the creatures within.</p>

  <p>For instance, once when Preston had been roaming his inner world, he had accepted a disciple. With his support, the disciple had established a powerful force in the inner world.</p>

  <p>But now, everything in this inner world would be destroyed soon and restored to the purest life vitality.</p>

  <p>The creatures were forced to comply to it as Preston was their God.</p>

  <p>Preston was also reluctant to take this step, but he felt he had no other choice left. His life vitality was used up and he knew that there was no longer any reason for him to persevere.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>As the loud sound rang out, an enormous crack appeared in the Sky Demon Eliminating Array.</p>

  <p>When the small skulls saw this, they rushed in through the crack.</p>

  <p>"Get away!"</p>

  <p>Preston had almost completely exhausted his last bit of life vitality. He struck out with his palm, sending the small skulls flying. However, even more small skulls poured in.</p>

  <p>Despair appeared on the faces of the others.</p>

  <p>Still, the expression on Yudie's face was abnormally calm.</p>

  <p>She was deep in rumination, missing many she had known, such as Luo Nian, Imogen, Cloud Hall...</p>

  <p>However, her greatest concern was still her husband.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she should not have run around like this. Instead, she should have stayed in the great world and waited for Luo Luo Zheng to return.</p>

  <p>With his ability, one day he would return to Cloud Hall. Luo Luo Zheng had only left for about seven years, and to a martial artist, it was only a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Regret did not do her any good. Slowly, she tied her hair into a bun and watched the Sky Demon Eliminating Array collapse. More and more small skulls fell toward the crowd.</p>

  <p>Everyone seemed far too calm.</p>

  <p>Their life vitality had almost run out earlier and now they were able to hold on just by means of their last strands. Now, even if they wanted to run, they could no longer do so.</p>

  <p>Who would have thought that after half a month of escaping, their fates would come to an end here. Helplessness struck them.</p>

  <p>Just one month ago, the Pure Jade Sacred Place had been prosperous.</p>

  <p>Now in the blink of an eye, all kinds of calamities had occurred in the universe. The creatures sighed in their hearts at the transience of the world.</p>

  <p>The crack on the array grew larger and larger as more and more small skulls began to pour in, all charging toward Preston.</p>

  <p>With Preston's death, the array would crumble. There was no way for anyone to survive.</p>

  <p>However, right at this moment, a sharp cry suddenly resounded in everyone's ears.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A sword beam, emanating a dangerous Mu Ning, shot straight down from the skies.</p>

  <p>The sword strike contained a terrible power.</p>

  <p>The sword light converged and then suddenly exploded. The small skulls were blasted away under its strength and scattered in all directions.</p>

  <p>Preston should have been able to do the same, especially by means of the Sky Demon Eliminating Array. His strength was comparable to a world lord's and he could have knocked the small skulls far away.</p>

  <p>However, he was still unable to destroy them completely, so the number of skulls continued to increase.</p>

  <p>"Is it that someone came here to help us?"</p>

  <p>Preston, who had given up by now, raised his head to look up at the skies. The power of the sword strike was akin to that of a Spirit Transformation Realm warrior. It was by no means the kind of power that a warrior from this world could manifest.</p>

  <p>The warriors raised their heads and saw eight beams of light rapidly approach from the skies.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The small skulls had managed to gather together. Now, the second sword strike pierced through the air and shot at them once again.</p>

  <p>The sword ray drew a straight line in the air, diffusing great radiance.</p>

  <p>Once again, it sent the small skulls away.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie raised her head and looked up at the sky. As she saw the man at the helm, her eyes twinkled with astonishment, tears starting to roll down her cheeks.</p>

  <p>She had been imagining and wishing that Luo Luo Zheng would come to her like a heavenly soldier, appearing in front of her out of the blue to save her from her current predicament.</p>

  <p>But the universe was so vast, how could Luo Luo Zheng have known that she was in danger?</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie had later dismissed her daydream and secretly laughed at herself, deeming it as only wishful thinking.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was not an omnipresent True God anyway. He could not control everything.</p>

  <p>However, in the end, he appeared when she was right on the verge of despair.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie did not know if Luo Luo Zheng could handle the small skulls, but she believed that since Luo Luo Zheng had shown up, he would be able to come up with a solution. She trusted him fully and had great confidence in him. To her, being able to meet Luo Luo Zheng at this moment was worth all the turmoil she had to face, even if she had to die the next moment. She had missed him dearly for several years. Now, she was finally meeting him again. It fulfilled her ardent wish, which might in fact be her last.</p>

  <p>In an instant, eight beams of light arrived above the imperial palace of the York Divine Kingdom and descended swiftly.</p>

  <p>The rulers of the four divine kingdoms were aware of this giant commotion. However, they could not understand just how these people had appeared. Could it be that they did not go through the ascending passageway?</p>

  <p>Preston looked bewildered and suspicious as he stared at the eight young warriors in front of him.</p>

  <p>The core disciples present there had similar looks of confusion and astonishment on their faces as they gazed at them.</p>
