  <p>
</p>

  <p>The Purple Snow World was located on the westernmost side of the Demon Night's territory. Here, there weren't any important mineral resources, and the vitality between heaven and earth wasn't very rich either. Overall, it couldn't be considered a strategic location.</p>

  <p>Thus, within this supreme world, there wasn't even a tenth grade sacred place. There were only a few small sacred places of the Demon Night that had gathered in the Purple Snow World.</p>

  <p>The only special characteristic of this world was its beautiful scenery. All year round, a light, fluffy, purple kind of snowflake floated here, covering the mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas. The entire place was coated with an illusory hue.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night members remained stunned for a long while before they came back to their senses. One of the leading grand world lords asked Luo Luo Zheng, "Is our Demon Night's Supreme Lord Leroy in the Purple Snow World?"</p>

  <p>Back then, when the battle between the two queens ended, Supreme Lord Leroy had also been heavily injured, but he had escaped.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night had also tried to find Supreme Lord Leroy, but this universe was simply too vast. If a Supreme Lord wanted to hide, there were plenty of ways to do so.</p>

  <p>No one would have expected that Supreme Lord Leroy hadn't gotten out of the Demon Night's territory. Instead, he had been hiding in a large border supreme world.</p>

  <p>As long as it was a supreme world occupied by the will of worlds, no secrets could get by Luo Luo Zheng. He had discovered Supreme Lord Leroy's location after searching idly through the memories of worlds' will.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng simply nodded and said, "Everyone, follow me."</p>

  <p>He couldn't guarantee that every Demon Night member that followed him was absolutely honest, but even if he revealed Supreme Lord Leroy's location now, it didn't matter much.</p>

  <p>The universe's situation had already progressed to its final step. Whether it was the battle between the human race and the Demon Night, the human race and the Sacred race, the different races and the Sacred race, all of them were waiting for a showdown.</p>

  <p>The Godly Genius of the Sacred race, Maha, had issued a challenge to fight within the Sunflower Water World in order to push everything toward a showdown as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng equally felt that it couldn't wait any longer. Before the showdown though, he had to get the Demon Night back on his side!</p>

  <p>In the midst of the purple snow, Luo Zheng's body resembled a leaf, swiftly floating downward.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Amber and the other members of the Demon Night followed closely behind.</p>

  <p>Below the crowd was a huge mountain range. These snowy mountains were covered in purple, making them look like a sleeping dragon that stretched endlessly.</p>

  <p>Once Luo Luo Zheng had slowly sunk into the depths of the mountains, he immediately dipped into a valley created by two steep triangles.</p>

  <p>Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!</p>

  <p>On both sides of the valley, a few gigantic, purple fierce bears could be heard roaring at the crowd in the sky. Their roars reverberated throughout the valley, giving off an extremely terrifying sound.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng led the way with an expressionless face, not giving in whatsoever to the bears' fierce provocation.</p>

  <p>A Demon Night grand world lord glanced at the roaring bears and frowned in an instant. Two circles of red light, one big and one small, appeared in the grand world lord's pupils. The big circle of light started to shrink, and the small circle of light kept enlarging.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the two circles of light began to converge.</p>

  <p>And as they did, a formless Mu Ning spread out from the grand world lord's body.</p>

  <p>The instant the purple fierce bears came into contact with this Mu Ning, the originally noisy bears seemed to have met their greatest nemesis.</p>

  <p>Ahhhooo...</p>

  <p>The purple bears, no longer fierce, all turned around at the same time and retreated back into their individual caves, not daring to make another sound.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" the Demon Night grand world lord coldly snorted and then chased downward after them. A Demon Night warrior, long locked up on Prison Island, definitely had an extraordinary strength and talent.</p>

  <p>When he arrived at the bottom of the valley, Luo Luo Zheng circled around however, he didn't find any entrance hiding here.</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy had been hiding at this exact location for many years. As a Supreme Lord, once he was underground, he would have only naturally changed the layout of this place, sealing off all paths that led to his hideout.</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng couldn't find a path, he'd only have to create one for himself.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng found a flat spot in the rock and with a wave of his hand, all the surrounding snow was immediately blown away.</p>

  <p>He then bent down and pressed his hand to the ground. With a light tap of his finger, a rumbling noise began to sound. Not long after, the ground beneath Luo Zheng's feet split open and a bottomless hole appeared.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded at Amber, who was behind him, and slipped down into the big hole. Amber followed closely behind, and the rest of the Demon Night members didn't hesitate a moment longer. Since they had already followed Luo Luo Zheng here, nothing would stop them now, even if it was dangerous.</p>

  <p>That was when Luo Luo Zheng, with a single tap of his finger, opened up a vertical well that ran as deep as ten miles!</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng reached the bottom of the deep well, he repeated the same movement, pointing downward. The well continued to stretch.</p>

  <p>After repeating this over a hundred times, the deep well that extended from the valley to the underground had reached a depth of over a thousand miles. Looking up, one could no longer see the entrance of the well at all.</p>

  <p>"How long is it before we can reach our destination?" One of the world lords was beginning to lose her patience.</p>

  <p>"Very soon," replied Luo Luo Zheng, keeping his calm.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng tapped his finger at the bottom to deepen the well once more, the bottom of the well finally pierced through, revealing a huge cave underneath.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng entered first of course, and upon doing so, he noticed his surroundings were densely packed with small karst caves.</p>

  <p>The karst caves, thousands of miles below the surface, were formed tens of millions of years ago. There used to be a rich underground river here.</p>

  <p>"Which path should we take?" The warriors were curious and asking questions, now.</p>

  <p>The densely-packed karst caves formed a natural, giant maze. A sudden general worry that Luo Luo Zheng would not be capable of finding the correct path took over.</p>

  <p>It might have been difficult for the others, but it was far from being a big deal for Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>The memories he had in his mind not only allowed him to accurately distinguish between each cave, but also provided the information about the process of how they were formed and evolved in the past.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng wasn't omnipotent in this universe. Only Mike possessed such an ability. However, if the will of worlds were to spread throughout the universe, then he would be in an omniscient state. He would be able to see through all the secrets in this world. That ability was also very powerful.</p>

  <p>"Just follow close," Luo Luo Zheng replied, before choosing a cave and flying into it.</p>

  <p>There were very few creatures that existed in such a deep underground.</p>

  <p>However, as they traveled through the zigzagging cave, they encountered more than a dozen fierce beasts. Most of these creatures were not a threat to the warriors, but there was a kind of eyeless frog that had almost killed one of the world lords. This kind of colorful frog emitted a terrifying poison.</p>

  <p>After travelling horizontally underground for hundreds of miles, they finally arrived at the end of the karst cave.</p>

  <p>When they reached its end, they realized that the cave was flat from top to bottom. Apparently, it was handmade. What was more, it seemed that someone was living here!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng grounded his feet on the floor below him and slowly walked forward, a look of vigilance wrinkling his features.</p>

  <p>He knew that Supreme Lord Leroy was here, but Supreme Lord Leroy was unaware of Luo Zheng's arrival. If he rashly rushed in, it might attract Supreme Lord Leroy's counterattack. Even if Supreme Lord Leroy was injured, a Supreme Lord's tricks remained very terrifying!</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Luo Zheng was about to turn a corner, a golden beam of light suddenly shot toward him!</p>

  <p>Hiss? The golden stream of light was only as thick as his little finger and it slid past Luo Zheng's nose, just missing him by a hair. With such an outrageous speed, the stream of light seemed to have completely disregarded the laws of space!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng hadn't realized what it was just yet.</p>

  <p>"It's the Scorching Sun Arrow!"</p>

  <p>Demon Night martial artists' excited voice sounded from behind him.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Leroy is really and truly here!"</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Leroy's full name was Leroy Meng. The Demon Night race was the most proficient in archery of all in the universe. Before Leroy carried the Heavenly Destiny, he was also the most powerful archer in the Demon Night race!</p>

  <p>Scorching Sun Arrow was one of Leroy's unique techniques!</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Leroy! My name is Abby!" a grand world lord of Demon Night impatiently shouted. Her voice echoed in the depths of the cave, loud and clear.</p>

  <p>Most of the Demon Night members present were from the Saint Spear Sect, and Leroy was originally the world lord of this same sect. Later on, with the help of Xun, Leroy carried a Heavenly Destiny and became a Supreme Lord. Among these Demon Night members, it was only expected that there were people who were very familiar with Leroy.</p>

  <p>This grand world lord, the one who went by the name of Abby, was related to Supreme Lord Leroy by blood.</p>

  <p>As her voice echoed through the cave, she waited, but there was no response that came back from the depths.</p>

  <p>Abby's anxiety seemed to be climbing somewhat and an overwhelming feeling to rush into the cave washed over her. As she passed by Luo Luo Zheng though, he extended his hand and grabbed her by the waist, pulling her back abruptly.</p>

  <p>Szzz!</p>

  <p>Another golden ray of light flashed past the two of them this time. The arrow had come so close to Abby's bangs that it left a burning gash on her forehead.</p>

  <p>Although it was only a minor wound, it was still extremely dangerous.</p>

  <p>Had it gone just an inch deeper, her entire upper skull would have been lifted right off by this arrow!</p>
