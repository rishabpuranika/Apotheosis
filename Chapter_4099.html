  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the past, however, a particular Space and Time Calamity affected a large area, instilling a great deal of panic within the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Spirit King Cornelius heard of this, he made a judgment.</p>

  <p>He claimed the Space and Time Calamity would hover over the main world like a dark plague, annihilating those who inhabited it. This caused the Four Spirits Sect to worry even more.</p>

  <p>He also claimed the only way to avoid the destruction was to find solace in the secondary worlds.</p>

  <p>He explained this by mentioning the difference of space and time between the two kinds of worlds. He said that since space and time of the secondary worlds were different from the main world's, then they would be safe from the latter's disaster.</p>

  <p>However, as the Monkey Spirit King was telling this story, he began to feel his blood beginning to boil.</p>

  <p>"That particular Space and Time Calamity," Zheng said, ''did it ever happen?'' Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King simply laughed. He laughed not in a way that showed amusement but in a way that warned rage was coming. "No," he said, shaking his head. "It didn't. That was how I knew it was all orchestrated by Cornelius. That vicious snake set up a trap in the chaos to destroy the Monkey Spirit Sect!" the Monkey Spirit King growled, his eyes fuming with anger.</p>

  <p>During the years he was trapped within his dream, he felt his hatred for Cornelius grow more fervent as the days went on.</p>

  <p>He couldn't deny the fact that the four sects couldn't stand each other.</p>

  <p>They couldn't get along, but they still managed to respect each other enough as not to cause any major tensions.</p>

  <p>If there were any sects that bonded well together, it would be the Snake Spirit Sect and the Human Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>At first, the Monkey Spirit King did not doubt that Cornelius had the intention to annihilate his sect.</p>

  <p>However, the Snake Spirit Sect made its first move after the Monkey Spirit Sect brought the Ghost Mountain into the chaos.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King did all that he could to fight off the attacks, but he could not defeat the treacherous Cornelius, who ended up biting him into a death-like slumber.</p>

  <p>Even the Monkey Spirit King's nobility was no match for the Snake Spirit King's poison.</p>

  <p>As the poison entrapped him within his dream, the rest of the monkey spirits were led to death too, having no time to resist.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King did not wake up as a Treacherous Being until now.</p>

  <p>''The sad thing is, I still have no idea what Cornelius' motive for doing all this is," the Monkey Spirit King admitted, bitterness evident in his voice.</p>

  <p>Before the attacks happened, the Monkey Spirit Sect used to be the most powerful sect in the Four Spirits Sect in terms of brute strength.</p>

  <p>However, they were wiped off the face of their world without even knowing why. It was a truth they found hard to face.</p>

  <p>''Do you know what happened to the other three sects?'' Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King shook his head. ''No, I do not, but as I reckon it, it did not end well for the Bird Spirit King, not even the Human Spirit King.''</p>

  <p>Within the Four Spirits Sect, it was the Monkey Spirit Sect to be attacked first, and among the four kings, it was the Monkey Spirit King who first bit the dust.</p>

  <p>Because of this, he had no idea what happened to the main world and the chaos. This left him plenty of room to suspect.</p>

  <p>After answering Zheng's question, he raised his finger to point at the surface of the Ghost Mountain, tapping on it ever so slightly. By the touch of his skin, a huge door emerged from the mountain. He then stepped inside the door with Zheng still on his palm.</p>

  <p>The upper half of the Ghost Mountain was reserved for the Monkey Spirit King, which was the space large enough to accommodate someone of his stature.</p>

  <p>After entering the mountain, the Monkey Spirit King gently placed Zheng on the ground. He then took off the Thirteen Teeth Necklace from his broad neck.</p>

  <p>With a slight wave of his hand, the necklace began to tremble. After a few seconds, thirteen bloodline powers from the necklace began to release their auras.</p>

  <p>''Look here, '' the Monkey Spirit King said, calling Zheng's attention. ''These thirteen bloodline powers all came from the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>However, there are still nine wolf teeth which need revitalizing. Now, you have the ancestry-level bloodline with you. Tell me, can you replenish the nine wolf teeth?''</p>

  <p>As soon as he said this, the Monkey Spirit King tapped the ground with his hand, as if he were asking it to do something.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, the ground answered, caving in to reveal the nine wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>This set of teeth could easily be paralleled to those on the necklace, but unlike the latter, these teeth had nothing inside of them.</p>

  <p>Not everything could bear the power of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>These nine wolf teeth once belonged to the most powerful wolf king in the main world.</p>

  <p>The wolf king was more than capable of fighting against all the leaders of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>After the Monkey Spirit King had defeated the wolf king, he pulled out his teeth— all twenty-two of them. With the ancestry-level bloodline, he was able to obtain thirteen bloodline powers.</p>

  <p>He had brought Zheng into the Ghost Mountain because he hoped that Zheng would be able to help him obtain new blended bloodlines from the ancestry-level bloodline and injecting them into the nine wolf teeth.</p>
