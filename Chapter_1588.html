<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The dark red ghost face was nailed in and started cracking.</p>

  <p>The cracks spread quickly until they completely engulfed the entirety of the stone's surface.</p>

  <p>These huge blocks of stones were originally ordinary stones.</p>

  <p>But their surfaces were protected by extremely strong Law of Causality which prevented them from being broken.</p>

  <p>This was the reason why no matter how powerful a battle between warriors was, the walls of the main cities would never be broken.</p>

  <p>"I was scared to death..." the ogre murmured weakly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had shot an arrow just now that missed him by mere millimeters.</p>

  <p>"Sorry about that," Luo Zheng apologized with a smile.</p>

  <p>Everything was so chaotic and he couldn't really think straight when he launched his arrow.</p>

  <p>The ogre laughed. "It's alright. At least we can finally get through this damn hall." There wasn't really any harm done and even if the arrow did hit him, it still wouldn't be deadly. Zheng's bow was obtained from the Lower World and could only be considered a lower-ranked divine weapon, meaning it was no match to the ogre warrior's armor.</p>

  <p>The ogre turned to the idle stone beside him. He patted it gently and the stone immediately exploded into smithereens.</p>

  <p>They had previously been chased by these stones all over the place but the tables had turned and they were now able to smash them all into pieces.</p>

  <p>"Amazing!" Janet told Luo Zheng with a sweet smile.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged and pulled a skull from his back. "I was just lucky. I didn't expect this little skull to be useful." He never thought that this indestructible annoyance was going to come in handy at such a crucial moment.</p>

  <p>Back in the first hall, Luo Zheng had almost caused the death of several warriors, so a lot of them harbored a lot of anger towards him.</p>

  <p>However, his actions here in the second hall proved to be extremely effective in getting through the challenges. He went from dead weight to an accidental hero.</p>

  <p>This temporary team was sure to bond even more once they got through more challenges together.</p>

  <p>"Bang, bang, bang..."</p>

  <p>More than forty blocks of stone had been smashed and reduced to rubble.</p>

  <p>Once all stones were gone, the warriors now fixed their eyes upon a very interesting sight: two masses of Illusion Points that gathered in the middle of the hall, left behind by the two warriors who died under the strong square light pillars.</p>

  <p>Since they weren't killed by another warrior, the Illusion Points could be considered free game.</p>

  <p>The warriors looked at the points, and then at each other. There were probably millions of Illusion Points just waiting to be claimed on the floor. It wasn't a small number at all.</p>

  <p>However, they were faced with the dilemma of allocating these points amongst themselves.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing should get half of the Illusion Points," Janet quickly declared in a non-negotiable voice.</p>

  <p>The short warrior nodded in agreement. "Okay. Then we can share the rest equally."</p>

  <p>The warrior wearing the round hat opened his mouth. "Why should he..."</p>

  <p>Janet and the short warrior shot him nasty glares, silencing him before he could even finish his sentence.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was the one who contributed the most to help them get through the second hall so it was only right that he got the most number of Illusion Points.</p>

  <p>Glad that things turned out in his favor, Luo Zheng quickly walked towards the mass of Illusion Points and absorbed half. These points could be considered additional income, perhaps even as a sort of 'inheritance' from the dead warriors.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the group quickly reached an agreement and absorbed their allocated Illusion Points one by one. Cheating wasn't a possibility since anyone who broke the deal and tried to absorb more than their share would get viciously attacked by the others.</p>

  <p>After absorbing the Illusion Points, the group then advanced towards the end of the Hall of Causality. The white light grates, which previously blocked them, had now disappeared.</p>

  <p>However, a huge, square stone still blocked their way.</p>

  <p>The sight stumped all of them!</p>

  <p>"Why is this stone here?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know! Why?"</p>

  <p>"Let me deal with it!"</p>

  <p>The ogre had just recently broken around fifteen of these huge stones.</p>

  <p>Figuring that this one wasn't going to be that different, he confidently walked towards it and struck its sides with both palms concentrated with destructive energy.</p>

  <p>"Puff!"</p>

  <p>Everyone expected the stone to shatter just as the other stones did.</p>

  <p>However, it simply sat there, still whole and very much undamaged.</p>

  <p>The sight made everyone frown.</p>

  <p>They had already broken the rules of the heavens, so this huge block of stone should've shattered the moment the ogre struck it.</p>

  <p>Why was it completely unharmed by the blow?</p>

  <p>Was it still perhaps shrouded in the invisible power of law? If that was the case, then how were they ever going to get through?</p>

  <p>"What's going on? This stone... I can't destroy it..."</p>

  <p>But before he could even finish his words, the stone's surface suddenly started to glow a faint, yellow light.</p>

  <p>The yellow light then separated into numerous yellow dots that immediately flew towards the ogre's body...</p>

  <p>"How can there be so many Illusion Points coming out?" And he was right to ask. The number of points wasn't small at all. With just that one strike, the ogre had been able to obtain nearly 400, 000 Illusion Points!</p>

  <p>Everyone watched this with great interest.</p>

  <p>"If I'm not wrong, this may be the second hall's reward. Everyone can get the reward but the amount is dependent on the amount of power the warrior displays," Janet explained.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" The ogre's eyes widened in shock. "No! I should have another try!"</p>

  <p>When he struck the stone, he only used around half of his power since all he really wanted was to shatter it like the rest of the stones inside the hall. If he was able to get 400, 000 points with just half of his strength, then that meant he could've gotten so much more if he went in with full power.</p>

  <p>"BOOM!"</p>

  <p>There was a loud bang as the ogre punched the stone with a force much powerful than before.</p>

  <p>However, no more Illusion Points came out of the stone.</p>

  <p>Everyone stood there with looks of pity on their faces but there was no going about it. The ogre had his turn and got only 400, 000 points out of it.</p>

  <p>The ogre silently retreated to the side in resentment, clearly regretting his rash decision of attacking the stone so impulsively.</p>

  <p>Now it was the others' turn to give it a try.</p>

  <p>The Demon Night warrior stood in front of the stone. They all understood that they should use their most destructive methods to attack the stone.</p>

  <p>They would have to bring out the big guns and attack this stone with everything they had got in order to reap its huge rewards!</p>

  <p>The Demon Night warrior took a few seconds to think of her strategy in dealing with this stone. Once she made up her mind, she took two steps back and took out a fiery-red longbow.</p>

  <p>"This bow... Is it also a supreme divine weapon?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't really been paying much attention to this woman. She was silent and preferred to keep to herself. The only interaction she ever did with any of them was when she gave the Blue Phoenix feather to Janet.</p>

  <p>If she was in possession of a supreme divine weapon, then that meant that she enjoyed a high status in their race, perhaps even higher than Aurora's!</p>

  <p>The woman skillfully gripped the bow and pulled on the bowstring, aiming it at the stone.</p>

  <p>'There's no arrow though...' Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>But soon enough, the fiery-red longbow started to glow as some kind of powerful energy surged through it. Not long after, a vortex of fire appeared in front of the bow and spat out a crimson arrow!</p>

  <p>"This is the Moon Bursting Flame Bow, ranked a bit below the 2, 100th on the Universe Spirit Tablet," Janet helpfully explained to Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Demon Night woman quickly released her hold on the bowstring and sent the arrow flying straight to the stone!</p>
