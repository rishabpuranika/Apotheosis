<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Harold had promised Yan time and time again that she'd definitely see Zheng in the Non-combat Zone.</p>

  <p>It was no wonder why Yan's heart was filled with expectation.</p>

  <p>What she hadn't expected though, was for her brother to appear in front of her in the way he did.</p>

  <p>After having gone through the second round of screening, she was a little tired and unmotivated.</p>

  <p>The second she saw Zheng, all the fatigue, dissatisfaction, and worries in her heart had disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>Once they went their separate ways in the Central Region, Yan entered the divine land with Harold.</p>

  <p>According to the time flow rate in the universe, Zheng had been separated from his sister for several decades now.</p>

  <p>Contrastingly however, according to the time flow rate in the divine land, the two had only been away from one another for a few years.</p>

  <p>It was in fact in these last few years that Yan had finally understood what a secondary creature and a universe meant. She had greatly matured.</p>

  <p>In the universe, a supreme world was even larger than one thousand great worlds combined as one.</p>

  <p>A great world and the Central Region were nothing more than a drop of water in the bucket.</p>

  <p>In this point of view, Yan and her brother could be considered insignificant specks of dust on the drop.</p>

  <p>No matter how insignificant they were, they couldn't simply be ignored.</p>

  <p>What happened instead was that they were so tiny that they couldn't be noticed and were less taken seriously by others at all.</p>

  <p>As soon as Harold took notice of her, Yan was directly brought from the Central Region to the divine land.</p>

  <p>As for her brother, he still resembled the almost invisible dust.</p>

  <p>Despite that, he constantly struggled throughout the universe, steadily becoming stronger and stronger, growing sturdily and barbarously, and experiencing countless trials and tribulations between life and death.</p>

  <p>Alongside the unimaginable difficulty, he finally stood before her.</p>

  <p>She had waited too long for this day to come true.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Yan's tiptoes tapped together lightly, and her light body slid toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>She threw herself into his arms and snuggled her face into the crook of his shoulder.</p>

  <p>Tears gushed out from the corners of Yan's eyes, instantly wetting Zheng's robe.</p>

  <p>Yan kept sobbing, but couldn't manage to utter a single word.</p>

  <p>Zheng gently patted her on the head and comforted her in a soft voice, "It isn't easy for me to come here. You know that. Why are you crying?"</p>

  <p>As she heard his voice, Yan cried even harder. She stammered, "I, I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Silly girl," Zheng said, coaxing her with a smile.</p>

  <p>Yan shook her head gently and replied, "No, I'm not silly. From now on, I'll be your protector!"</p>

  <p>Her words amused Zheng.</p>

  <p>Harold was standing not far off and watched the scene, his hands on his back. There was a sense of relief on his face.</p>

  <p>From the moment Zheng and Yan were born, he had known that this would happen.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was the most important part of his master's plan. At least, it was going well for the time being.</p>

  <p>If his master could see Zheng and his sister's reunion in the divine land, he'd be very happy, wouldn't he?</p>

  <p>Standing beside Zheng and his sister was a top-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Although he wasn't the disciple of a powerful clan, he was still an outstanding warrior among the first-tier clans in the divine land.</p>

  <p>This True God was lucky enough to pass the second round of screening, which made him feel ecstatic.</p>

  <p>During the screenings for the debate over the Godly Ways however, the True God hadn't been overtly impressed.</p>

  <p>The strange monsters in the Killing Zone didn't have much of an effect on him.</p>

  <p>Yan's deadly strikes, on the other hand, had really riled him up!</p>

  <p>In the fifth stage of the Killing Zone, this top-rank True God had come face to face with four crises.</p>

  <p>Every time, he had been saved by this young girl.</p>

  <p>Notably when faced with a tree dragon, the girl had given off a terrifying aura.</p>

  <p>With both an extremely beautiful figure and posture, she sliced the tree dragon into two halves.</p>

  <p>Her hair fluttered in the wind, and on her stunning face, a pair of eyes revealed a murderous look. The scene had been deeply imprinted in the top-rank True God's mind.</p>

  <p>Such an extraordinary girl was hard to find, even in the entire divine land.</p>

  <p>It took less than a split second and he had already developed a strong obsession for her.</p>

  <p>He thought that he was born into a rich family with great talents. Perhaps only the most extraordinary top-rank True Gods from other powerful clans could outshine him.</p>

  <p>No matter where this girl came from, it was simply impossible that she had been born into a powerful clan. Thus, he assumed that he just might have a chance.</p>

  <p>Moments after passing the second round of screening, he had the intention of introducing himself and at the same time, requesting her name.</p>

  <p>He didn't have the chance to say anything, though.</p>

  <p>He watched her, from a short distance. Without hesitating, she immediately jumped into the arms of a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>As he watched, his mind went completely blank.</p>

  <p>He couldn't believe his own eyes. What had he just seen? Why had she done that?</p>

  <p>It was ridiculous!</p>

  <p>As he was feeling depressed, he eavesdropped on the conversation between the two.</p>

  <p>It was at that very moment that he understood that the low-rank True God was her brother.</p>

  <p>The two were siblings, but the girl's cultivation base was much higher than that of her brother.</p>

  <p>After he learned this, the depressed look on his face disappeared. He smiled with complaisance instead.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's cultivation base wasn't considered very high as a low-rank True God, he just might become his future brother-in-law. Thus, he had to curry favor with Zheng.</p>

  <p>For a while, he wandered around before finally finding his opportunity.</p>

  <p>He gradually moved closer and bowed toward Yan and Zheng.</p>

  <p>As they noticed him, Zheng frowned and asked, "What's up? Need something?"</p>

  <p>Zheng had just noticed this top-rank True God now, but he couldn't understand why he kept circling around them, which was becoming annoying.</p>

  <p>The top-rank True God had a smile plastered on his face and said politely,</p>

  <p>"Your sister saved my life many times in the Killing Zone. I have to repay her kindness. Let me introduce myself. I'm Enoch Nanlong. My father is a Demi-holy Being. His name is Iverson Nanlong."</p>

  <p>The Nanlong Clan was an outstanding first-tier clan in the south of the divine land and it had one of the greatest reputations of all.</p>

  <p>If he was given a few more divine eras, Iverson would successfully become a Holy Being and would eventually build a Floating Island above the Time Sea.</p>

  <p>Therefore, standing before Zheng and his sister, Enoch felt very confident. Of course, introductions were still mandatory.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng and Yan were both estranged here in the divine land.</p>

  <p>This was the first time that Yan had left the Everest Spirit Mountain after entering the divine land. She knew only little about the powerhouses and the forces of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands. Aside from that, she knew nothing about the divine land.</p>

  <p>When Zheng had arrived in the divine land, it hadn't been long since he had gained a superficial understanding of the forces through cursory observation, and he had never heard of the Nanlong Clan. However, as Enoch had said, his father was a Demi-holy Being, and thus, Zheng had to show his respect, at the very least.</p>

  <p>"You're welcome," Zheng replied faintly before grasping onto his sister's arm and dragging Yan away.</p>

  <p>Instead, Yan turned her head and smiled back at Enoch. "Don't be so stupid next time. That way, you won't need my help!"</p>

  <p>Enoch stood his ground and stared at Yan's bright smile.</p>

  <p>As he stood, the two approached a consummate True God.</p>

  <p>'That consummate True God is probably an elder of their clan. The two of them shouldn't be from a clan with no mark, ' Enoch thought to himself.</p>

  <p>No matter what, Yan had already successfully passed the second round of screening.</p>

  <p>Her brother was merely a low-rank True God and he therefore wouldn't join the debate over the Godly Ways.</p>

  <p>Enoch thought he'd still have a chance of meeting with Yan face to face in the debate.</p>
