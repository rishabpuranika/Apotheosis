<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1125 A Punch (Part Two) </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>It was precisely because of these reasons that the other three rulers of the divine kingdoms had given way to War Emperor York on many matters.</p>

  <p>Even when it came to the distribution of the resources coming down from the Reverse Spirit Channel, the York Divine Kingdom would usually obtain far more amount than the other three! That was how the little monster was so useful to the York Divine Kingdom and its people.</p>

  <p>Now that the little monster had become a simpleton, he had suffered great losses! It was too big loss that he couldn't simply let Zheng escape easily from his wrath.</p>

  <p>"How? Why are you even asking a question with an obvious answer? Of course, you have to pay with your life, you foolish man! Now I will give you a chance. If you can take a punch from me, then I'll let you go! Hah, there's no way a mere human kid like you can do that, so prepare to die," he said, feeling insane. A sinister smile appeared on the face of War Emperor York. Right now, he was not in the right mind to take about anything else other than killing Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Aah!"</p>

  <p>Fiona, who was at the top of the stairs, suddenly covered her mouth with astonishment. This scene was too horrible to witness.</p>

  <p>Let Zheng take a punch from an almighty warrior at the Soul Sea Realm?</p>

  <p>That could not happen. Wasn't that equivalent to killing him? He would probably die at this rate. As Fiona thought of this, a trace of sadness reflected in her charming eyes. She admitted that she couldn't help but get worried about Zheng's safety at the moment. She was aware of how powerful War Emperor York was.</p>

  <p>Randy closed his eyes and clenched his teeth, looking very miserable at the sight of the scene. Even a lord like him would not dare to take a punch from War Emperor York.</p>

  <p>If it was a master at the Life and Death Realm whom Zheng had to face, he might have the chance to battle against him. With Zheng's powerful body, he might be able to withstand a punch from a Life and Death Realm master. But for some powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm like War Emperor York, the chance for Zheng to survive was slim. It was too impossible!</p>

  <p>Zheng was doomed! And he couldn't escape now.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Zheng's heart beat faster when he heard the words of War Emperor York. It was true that the strength of a powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm was beyond imagination, but Zheng had just merged with the will of this great world.</p>

  <p>Previously, the little monster was able to easily block Zheng's attack. Even Zheng had exploited all his strength, the little monster was able to divert his strength to the surrounding mountains! Then, what could War Emperor York do?</p>

  <p>After Zheng had merged with the will of the great world, he had a sense of familiarity with everything around. It was as if he had established a special connection with this world. If he could use the mountains, rivers, and lakes in the surroundings to block the punch of War Emperor York, then this might be a good solution to this problem. It might save him this way. There was no other way for him to decline this offer because this would cause fewer casualties than going in an all-around fight with the emperor, where he had little chance to win.</p>

  <p>After thinking for a while, Zheng said calmly, "Okay, I agree. I will take it."</p>

  <p>Agree? Did he really say he agreed?</p>

  <p>Even War Emperor York was a bit taken aback to hear Zheng's answer. Zheng had actually agreed just like that? How brave and reckless could this kid be?</p>

  <p>At first, War Emperor York had thought that Zheng was going to argue with him, struggling to make him spare his life with some smart words. If Zheng did that, War Emperor York would totally ignore him. Since they were all fighters, they both should understand the rules of martial artists' world. A mere warrior at the Virtual Tribulation Realm was trying to reason with War Emperor York, a mighty man of the Soul Sea Realm?</p>

  <p>There was no space for mercy and empathy! It would be such a big joke!</p>

  <p>In the battles among warriors, the law of the jungle often prevailed. The world of martial artists was cruel. If Zheng wanted to reason with him, he should at least be more powerful than him! In other words, strength and fists had the say above everything! No more pleading and tug-of-war.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng hadn't thought of reasoning at all and had agreed just like that. It was foolish for everyone around. War Emperor York smiled instead. "Do you really think you can block my attack?"</p>

  <p>With pure sincerity, Zheng shook his head and said, "I'm not sure."</p>

  <p>"Hahahahahaha!" War Emperor York let out a hysterical laugh. He was guessing Zheng's thoughts. Perhaps this kid thought that he could really resist a punch from him. He was simply too naive! How come he encountered a kid like him? As his laughter gradually faded, a cold stare came after. Then War Emperor York lazily said, "Since you're so straightforward, I can really give you a chance. I will only use 80% of my strength in this punch. How about this?"</p>

  <p>'Eighty percent of his strength…'</p>

  <p>A powerful warrior at the Soul Sea Realm shook his head in silence. Zheng had no chance to survive. This would be his deadly fate.</p>

  <p>Only powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm knew how terrifying the power of Soul Sea Realm masters was. After a Soul Sea Realm master formed the Soul Sea in his body and created his own world, the life vitality gathered in his body was as vast as the ocean. If the master condensed the life vitality and threw a punch, the power would be unimaginable. If possible, a warrior would prefer to kill himself than take a punch from a Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>Even if War Emperor York used only 30% of his strength, Zheng would still be killed, not to mention 80% of his strength. This was the thought that was shared by the powerful warriors at the Soul Sea Realm present.</p>

  <p>What they could feel right now was only pity for Zheng, and not even the tiniest bit of expectation that he would survive.</p>

  <p>Zheng's gaze was as calm as water. He nodded his head. He was also uncertain about the outcome, but he did not have a better choice at the moment. However, the will of the great world and his own body, which was a sacred weapon had given Zheng some confidence, which was why he agreed so readily. He was relying on them right now.</p>

  <p>A cold smile appeared on the face of War Emperor York, thinking that he could finally avenge his son's death and his loss of the little monster now. He had really begun to accumulate his life vitality. But at this moment, another voice suddenly rang out from the stairs, "Wait!"</p>

  <p>Gasping their breaths, everyone was intently watching Zheng's impending death. However, as a voice interrupted, everyone's attention was diverted to the origin of the voice. The one who spoke was actually the daughter of War King Wind, Fiona.</p>
