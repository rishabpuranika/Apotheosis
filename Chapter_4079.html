<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Decker's words, the human Great Ghost Priest abruptly stopped in his tracks.</p>

  <p>He was a bit confused.</p>

  <p>Some humans were looking for them on the Ghost Altar?</p>

  <p>Aside from him and his companions, there were no other human beings on the Night View Island. How could any appear on the Ghost Altar?</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Bainbridge did not expect that Decker would be so bold.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>He suddenly gathered his strength and squeezed Decker's neck. Decker choked and flushed a deep red, unable to say a word.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, Bainbridge." The human Great Ghost Priest followed up out of curiosity.</p>

  <p>In turn, Bainbridge's face darkened when he saw the human Great Ghost Priest chase after him, and he quickened his pace.</p>

  <p>When the human Great Ghost Priest saw Bainbridge's reaction, his suspicion deepened.</p>

  <p>He took a step forward.</p>

  <p>Then, his figure suddenly froze in place.</p>

  <p>Another copy of his figure appeared right in front of Bainbridge, and his first figure that he left behind slowly disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Bainbridge, why are you in such a hurry?" the human Great Ghost Priest asked.</p>

  <p>"It's none of your business!" Bainbridge hissed. Meanwhile, Decker kept struggling out of his grip.</p>

  <p>"Mmmmph... uhh..."</p>

  <p>He desperately tried to make a sound.</p>

  <p>However, Bainbridge's hand tightly gripped his neck like an iron clamp.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he could not speak at all.</p>

  <p>"But I heard him say that there are human beings on the Ghost Altar," said the human Great Ghost Priest.</p>

  <p>"You misheard him," Bainbridge answered gruffly.</p>

  <p>"It does not matter if I misheard him or not. I want to hear him say those words again," the human Great Ghost Priest said seriously.</p>

  <p>Bainbridge's nostrils flared in anger. "Are you making things difficult for me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, so what?" the Great Ghost Priest retorted.</p>

  <p>When Bainbridge heard those words, he became even more furious.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the human beings enjoyed a high status in the Ghost Mountain and received excellent treatment.</p>

  <p>The main point was that these humans were still quite powerful. Since Bainbridge couldn't defeat them, he had to let go of Decker now.</p>

  <p>He hesitated for a moment with a long face, as if he had thought of something. Then, he threw Decker on the ground and said, "Let's see how long you can act arrogantly!"</p>

  <p>The reason these humans had an extraordinary status in the Ghost Mountain was because the Monkey Spirit Sect pinned their hopes of awakening on them.</p>

  <p>But the Element Spirit Civilization brought wolf teeth...</p>

  <p>If the wolf teeth were real, then the humans would be useless!</p>

  <p>By then, the humans couldn't act so arrogantly anymore.</p>

  <p>Decker got up from the ground and hastily said, "Sir, the Element Spirit Civilization has trapped Zheng and the others on the Ghost Altar! Please go and save them!"</p>

  <p>The human Great Ghost Priest's face froze. "Zheng? Who is he?" he asked.</p>

  <p>There was no such person named Zheng in the 77th chaos. The human Great Ghost Priest surely did not know him.</p>

  <p>Decker didn't know much about that as well. He thought for a while, and then said, "Some people called Fuxi and the Snake Goddess are also in that group..."</p>

  <p>As soon as he said those two names, the human Great Ghost Priest became quite serious. "Where are they from?" he asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"From outside the Night View Island," answered Decker.</p>

  <p>"Outside the Night View Island?"</p>

  <p>The human Great Ghost Priest's expression changed a few times before he turned around and left.</p>

  <p>The passage where Bainbridge headed to was connected to the right side of the third floor of the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>The humans enjoyed special treatment on the third floor, and they owned almost the entire space on the right side.</p>

  <p>When he reached the end of the passage, he pushed open one of the doors.</p>

  <p>There was an open hall inside.</p>

  <p>In the hall was an old man, who was busy with something.</p>

  <p>Drops of blood fell from the old man's fingertips and merged into a small porcelain bottle.</p>

  <p>Tens of thousands of porcelain bottles were in front of him, all of which contained the blood of the Eternal Realm warriors. Their blood was the human race's foundation and the key to their survival in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>This old man was none other than the real Primeval Lord of Heaven, and he was carefully fusing with the blood power in the bottles.</p>

  <p>The only way to awaken the Ghost Master was to find all thirteen wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>However, the way out of the Night View Island was destroyed, so the chances of getting the wolf teeth were quite slim.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Primeval Lord of Heaven and the others finally came up with a solution.</p>

  <p>The wolf teeth fused with the bloodlines. Each of them contained different bloodline theurgies, and the Thirteen Teeth Necklace was a remarkably powerful magic treasure.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven tried to mix the bloodlines of many different Eternal Realm warriors to obtain the bloodlines similar to those of the wolf teeth.</p>

  <p>The process was incredibly difficult.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven had been trapped on the Night View Island for a long time.</p>

  <p>He had tried again and again for over a thousand chaotic eras, and now he finally achieved some great results.</p>

  <p>At the very least, the aura of the fused bloodline made the Ghost Master react.</p>

  <p>Even the slightest reaction was enough.</p>

  <p>The truth was that the Ghost Master's obsession with the wolf teeth was only due to the auras of the fused bloodlines.</p>

  <p>If the Primeval Lord of Heaven could truly create the auras of thirteen different fused bloodlines, then the Ghost Master would have a high chance of awakening.</p>

  <p>Because of that, the monkeys highly valued the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and subsequently, the human race held a high position in the Ghost Mountain.</p>

  <p>Even if the number of the Great Ghost Priest from other races had an absolute advantage, no one dared to offend the human race to their faces.</p>

  <p>Before Emperor Charm could say anything, the Primeval Lord of Heaven asked, "Emperor Charm, what happened? Why are you so anxious?"</p>

  <p>"The passage to the Night View Island has been repaired. The avatars of Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, and Eastern Emperor Taiyi have arrived. The Element Spirit Civilization has blocked them at the Ghost Altar!" said Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>At first, the Primeval Lord of Heaven wanted to mix the blood power in the two porcelain bottles.</p>

  <p>The bloodlines of the Eternal Realm masters were unique. Furthermore, since the bloodlines in the porcelain bottles had already gotten merged twice, he had to be careful when fusing them again.</p>

  <p>But as soon as he heard Emperor Charm's words, his hand trembled violently. Suddenly, a wisp of cyan smoke rose from one of the porcelain bottles, and a needle-like flame drilled out of the bottle's mouth. Then, the porcelain bottle broke into pieces.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>He almost thought that he had misheard Emperor Charm.</p>

  <p>In return, Emperor Charm quickly repeated his words.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was considerably shocked. After a few seconds, he said, "Ask Zhurong and Chiyou to go with us!"</p>

  <p>The four human warriors who served as Great Ghost Priests were Zhurong, Emperor Charm, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and Chiyou.</p>

  <p>At that point, it was like a thick cloud of misery floated in the air.</p>

  <p>The Eye Spirit seemed to be asleep and stayed still.</p>

  <p>As for Claire, she glanced wickedly at Zheng and said, "I'm not happy to let you live a little longer."</p>

  <p>"Even if you are unhappy, you have to endure it," Fuxi shot back coldly.</p>

  <p>After all, they were now in a pretty bad situation, so he and the others naturally felt anxious.</p>

  <p>A cold smile graced Claire's face. Then she suddenly looked up at the Great Ghost Priests and asked, "May I kill a few people first?"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead." A Great Ghost Priest waved his hand.</p>

  <p>These people's lives had nothing to do with the Great Ghost Priests. They only stayed to guard the Eye Spirit and his group.</p>

  <p>"Good!"</p>

  <p>With a cruel grin, Claire gently waved her hand, and the little white dragon that was inside her body came out again.</p>

  <p>A layer of flame scales coated its body as flames rose from its skin. Then, it moved towards Zheng.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a voice came from the space channel.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Finally, the four human Great Ghost Priests came out of the transmission channel.</p>
