<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The interaction between the Genuine Dragon and the Demon Night was not much.</p>

  <p>Granted, the cyan dragon inside Zheng had already known Xun for quite some time now and naturally understood her personality more.</p>

  <p>Despite being already a hundred thousand years old, Xun was nothing more than a child in the cyan dragon's eyes whose emotions he could predict just by looking at her face.</p>

  <p>And right now, she was clearly dissatisfied with Snow Demon's appearance as Yan.</p>

  <p>Ever since she ascended the throne, Xun had been heralded as the Demon Night's killing symbol that struck fear into the hearts of outsiders.</p>

  <p>Yao was her counterpart. She represented the Demon Night's law and enacted punishment against clansmen who committed heinous crimes.</p>

  <p>A queen's ascension was always significant as those who took the throne would also become a symbol for the entire race. It was even said that a Demon Night queen was tainted with a trace of divinity.</p>

  <p>After countless years, Xun was no longer just an ordinary queen though she also could not be considered a True God. Still, the Demon Night regarded her as a goddess: all-powerful and mighty. However, despite being a pseudo-divine, it seemed Xun showcased a very human emotion: liking Zheng.</p>

  <p>Even the cyan dragon was surprised at this realization. However, it had nothing to do with him so he just let it be for now. Right now, the Snow Demon had caught Zheng in its grasp and was a witness to the young man's greatest weakness. The cyan dragon only hoped that Zheng would be able to work it out for himself as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>The illusion wasn't fully the Snow Demon's work. All it really did was to build up the foundations by digging out a person's greatest desire. The rest of the picture would be supplied by the person himself who then essentially painted his own fantasy.</p>

  <p>And Zheng's deepest desire painted the most beautiful picture of warmth and serenity. It was around sunset and the entire Luo residence was covered with faint, orange light.</p>

  <p>Zheng was on the roof of the mansion with a serene view of the C County laid out before him. There were no fights and no noisy rackets, but just him, his family, and this peaceful, wonderful view.</p>

  <p>He couldn't remember the last time he experienced such peace and silence. The past few years had been hard on him as he spent every waking moment trying to strengthen himself and gain power. His life had been nothing but a constant uphill climb and the summit didn't seem to be anywhere near.</p>

  <p>Yan sat beside him, flipping through a stack of old calligraphy and paintings she found in a corner of their house. She was very curious and opened each dusty scroll one by one.</p>

  <p>The artworks were all laid down in an orderly fashion and she passed those she deemed interesting enough onto Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Look at this one Zheng!" she said, handing over a scroll to him. "This was left behind by the only top scholar in our clan. It was actually abandoned in the corner! What a pity…"</p>

  <p>Of course, a top scholar wasn't really a big achievement for a clan. In fact, it wasn't even a big deal. This world was controlled by warriors after all. Not even an emperor could afford to offend a sect lest he made his entire country suffer.</p>

  <p>But Zheng gave an extremely thorough commentary on that piece of calligraphy.</p>

  <p>Time passed quickly and the orange sky soon darkened into the starry, evening sky.</p>

  <p>Both brother and sister were still on the rooftop. Zheng was on his back, staring at the stars while Yan whispered beside him.</p>

  <p>Her murmurs were like a soft lullaby, pleasant to the ears. Zheng suddenly remembered how he accidentally fell asleep on the roof many times in the past. Once, he even fell off and suffered a really bad injury.</p>

  <p>He didn't realize it but he had actually fallen asleep, lulled by Yan's whispers. Everything was calm, peaceful and he was at ease with the world.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a strange smile appeared on Yan's face, one that did not seem to fit her beautiful face.</p>

  <p>Inches away from Zheng's face, Yan suddenly opened her small mouth and revealed a row of extremely sharp, white teeth!</p>

  <p>At that moment, Zheng's eyes flew open!</p>

  <p>There was a trace of reluctance in his eyes as he looked at this monster in front of him. "This experience wasn't so bad. I actually really liked it.</p>

  <p>Thank you," he said with a smile. However, his gaze soon turned cold.</p>

  <p>"But I must kill you now."</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>His hand shot out and quickly pierced through the monster's body.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a cold, sinister laugh echoed through the air as Yan transformed into an entirely different creature. Her hands elongated into sharp claws and she desperately tried to swipe at Zheng. Unfortunately, the bulk of a Snow Demon's ruse relied heavily on the illusion. Once the person it had hoped to ensnare woke up from his fantasy, then there wasn't really anything the Snow Demon could do but struggle and exert a few weak attacks.</p>

  <p>Zheng only needed to exert a minuscule amount of force before the Snow Demon's body was twisted in his hand and died.</p>

  <p>The monster's death quickly wiped away the scenery that had served as his fantasy stage. His eyes once again gained clarity and could now differentiate fact from fiction.</p>

  <p>The Snow Demon also disappeared, its twisted body breaking down into pieces that were carried away by the wind.</p>

  <p>Zheng could've killed the Snow Demon at the very start but he chose to let it set up an illusion for him. He was partly glad for the experience. At least he was able to reunite with Yan even for just a moment.</p>

  <p>Still, there was that all-too-familiar pang of sadness in his heart as he was thrown back into reality.</p>

  <p>"You're out?" Xun's voice rang out. Her voice had always been cold but there was a trace of bitterness mixed with it this time.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he said, not sensing the change in Xun's tone at all.</p>

  <p>He turned around and quickly looked at how the other warriors were doing. It seemed all of them were still immersed in their own illusions as they closed their eyes during falling down. Meanwhile, the Snow Demons were unrecognisable. Their appearances had changed in accordance with the warriors' illusions and their figures were currently hard at work, whispering sweet nothings to their victims' ears.</p>

  <p>The girl with golden hair seemed to be an exception though. She had used some sort of treasure to stabilize her heart which rendered the Snow Demon unable to change its appearance. The monster was unable to attack this whole time.</p>

  <p>"Freya!"</p>

  <p>Zheng burst in surprise when his gaze landed upon the girl.</p>

  <p>She was curled up in a ball with a smile on her face. In front of her was a Snow Demon who looked very much like Zheng.</p>

  <p>"That Zheng is even way more handsome than you!" Xun remarked.</p>

  <p>And it was true. This Zheng the Snow Demon pretended was taller than the real one and was undeniably more handsome.</p>

  <p>It is often said that we often idealize the people we like. Those we hold dear in our hearts, for example, would always appear more handsome in our minds than they do in real life. If we hate a person, however, then the opposite would apply: they would look uglier instead.</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't realize Freya thought of him that way which embarrassed him a bit.</p>

  <p>"What do we do now?" he asked, trying to divert the topic. "Do we wake them up or wait until they break free?"</p>

  <p>The Snow Demon hadn't done any sort of harm to Zheng. However, that didn't mean that it wasn't dangerous. If a person let his heart be confused by the monster then his soul would be devoured entirely. The only thing that would be left behind was his body which would then serve as an empty shell for the Snow Demon's possession.</p>

  <p>"Let's wait. Snow Demon can confuse people but I think they all have a high chance of breaking free from their illusions," Xun advised.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a warrior suddenly opened his eyes and a strange smile broke through his face. He let out a burst of shrill, feminine laughter and summoned a long sword to his hand before charging straight towards Freya.</p>

  <p>"That warrior! He's already been occupied by the Snow Demon! He can no longer be considered as a human! Kill him," Xun ordered.</p>

  <p>Even before Xun said that Zheng had already known that there was something wrong.</p>

  <p>He quickly reached out and grabbed onto Freya to pull her beside him.</p>

  <p>There was a bright flash of light just as he took out his sword from his space ring and sent forth three Nether God Shadows towards the warrior.</p>
