  <p>
</p>

  <p>His left leg was the most injured. It was almost cut off by the black cracks, painting an incredibly terrifying sight.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng did not care. Instead, his heart was filled with ecstasy.</p>

  <p>"Incredible. It seems the Chaotic Source Spirits can really split infinitely.</p>

  <p>My God..." The Primeval Lord of Heaven also took a deep breath.</p>

  <p>He knew just how powerful this characteristic was.</p>

  <p>After the second split, Zheng would be able to withstand one hundred thousand divine megatons of force.</p>

  <p>However, the Primeval Lord of Heaven remained unable to clearly judge the true conditions for this current situation.</p>

  <p>Could it be that one would be able to split up the Chaotic Source Spirits so long as they merged with the Chaotic Source Spirits and entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm with their physical body? Or was the Truth of Godly Way in Zheng's body an indispensable part of this process?</p>

  <p>As the Primeval Lord of Heaven thought this through, Zheng began to heal himself.</p>

  <p>The four wounds he sustained were incredibly serious and it would take him a significant amount of time to heal them.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was back to full health, Zheng rushed into the Myriad Tribulations Storm with great interest.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, he wanted to go back and experience the late stage of the Chaotic Source Realm, but on the other, he couldn't help but expect something more. Could the Chaotic Source Spirits split again?</p>

  <p>Thus, once he entered the Myriad Tribulations Storm, Zheng repeated his cultivation way once more.</p>

  <p>Step by step, he was once again able to return to the eighteenth layer!</p>

  <p>This time, his progress was much faster owing to the fact that his tribulation skeleton had gotten even stronger. In just a little over 10 days, the one thousand eight hundred Chaotic Source Spirits in his body rapidly expanded and lit up, occupying almost every corner of his body.</p>

  <p>Every single Chaotic Source Spirit within him emitted light and completely turned his body into a pillar of luminescence.</p>

  <p>When Zheng looked within, he suddenly found a strange phenomenon.</p>

  <p>He quickly called out for the Primeval Lord of Heaven for this unexplainable occurrence. "There seems to be a vortex in my body," Zheng told him.</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven inhaled sharply. "Vortex?!"</p>

  <p>Zheng continued to stare at this abnormality with deep curiosity. "It seems to be similar to that vortex in the suns created by Emperor Charm, also to that one on Eastern Emperor Taiyi's golden sword!" he described.</p>

  <p>This kind of vortex seemed to be spinning crazily but in truth, it was a mere, flat surface. To the creatures in the chaos, it did not exist and was only considered a form of expression.</p>

  <p>The one in Zheng's body was the same. It slowly rotated but did not devour anything.</p>

  <p>It was truly an interesting phenomenon. "Oh!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed. "Let me have a look then!"</p>

  <p>Zheng quickly agreed and the Primeval Lord of Heaven saw through his body.</p>

  <p>Among the many white light dots, he indeed saw a vortex.</p>

  <p>"What do you think? Are they the same?" Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>There was no way that the Primeval Lord of Heaven wouldn't know about this type of phenomenon. He was bound to be the highest authority of knowledge about this sort of thing.</p>

  <p>At last, the Primeval Lord of Heaven nodded in reply. "Yes, but the vortex is spinning in the reverse direction!"</p>

  <p>This sort of vortex was known as the descending vortex phenomenon. In nature, all energy descended from outside the chaos. But when it reached a certain level, it would form a vortex.</p>

  <p>All the descending vortexes he met before spun left but Zheng's was spinning right.</p>

  <p>"Reverse direction..." Zheng repeated.</p>

  <p>He wasn't stupid. He knew what this most probably entailed. "It seems that this is related to the characteristics of the Chaotic Source Spirits. The power they absorbed has actually been transferred to a space outside the chaos?!"</p>

  <p>"Very smart!" the Primeval Lord of Heaven exclaimed in satisfaction. "The Snake Goddess was the first one to make this conjecture a long time ago.</p>

  <p>After all, there was no way the power absorbed by the Chaotic Source Spirits would disappear for no reason. We weren't able to find any evidence to support this, until now!"</p>

  <p>Zheng tilted his head in curiosity. "Where is the absorbed energy being transmitted?" he asked.</p>

  <p>His reply from the Primeval Lord of Heaven was a shrug. "I'm afraid I don't have the answer. We do not know much about the Abstruse Energy World and there's no way to find out in such a short period of time. We'll have to rely on you and your son to explore it..."</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit, who had been silent all this time, suddenly sighed. "I thought Wing King had had a thorough understanding of the Other Shore. I never expected so much of it to be shrouded by mystery. It's really incredible."</p>

  <p>As the Regal Jade Spirit understood the human civilization little by little, he gradually found that the Regal Jade Civilization's understanding of the chaos was far inferior although they were powerful.</p>

  <p>"Regal Jade Spirit, you're being too modest. To the entire Abstruse Energy World, our knowledge is but a drop in the ocean. I had previously thought our human race's understanding was second to that of the Element Spirit Civilization but it seemed we were far more inferior compared to the Calculation Civilization," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>It had to be noted that the Calculation Civilization had been able to transform the light dots into normal images and communicate with the creatures in the Abstruse Energy World. But the human race couldn't do this till now.</p>

  <p>After spending a bit more time in the eighteenth layer, Zheng broke through the nineteenth and twentieth layers relying on the strength of the Chaotic Source Spirits.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore creatures were already able to remain calm after seeing his performance. His previous outstanding performance had stunned them enough.</p>

  <p>It seemed when the Land of Bone Tribulation was opened for the third time, Zheng would no doubt be able to achieve the Myriad Tribulations Body, perhaps even obtain a few Bone Tribulation Imprints.</p>

  <p>The core of the Myriad Tribulations Storm was a mixture of Soul Interdicting Water and a sort of golden liquid.</p>

  <p>It was like a fierce tornado with the central area as the most chaotic and dangerous part.</p>

  <p>When Zheng got sucked in, so did his tribulation skeleton at the other side.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>Countless black cracks appeared and turned into tens of millions of black blades that cut Zheng's body and his tribulation skeleton at the other side.</p>

  <p>After Zheng passed through the eighteenth layer, his tribulation skeleton turned completely golden and released a dignified aura. If this glowing, golden skeleton merged with him to make him obtain the Myriad Tribulations Body, then Zheng would be able to release an amazing power with the help of the Civilization Artifacts. He had a lot of expectations for this.</p>

  <p>However, even as he entered the twentieth layer, Zheng had to give his tribulation bones a bit more time to be refined. Thus, he could only sit on the bone plate and wait patiently.</p>

  <p>There was no sign of a third split for the Chaotic Source Spirits, which made him feel a bit disappointed.</p>

  <p>"Primeval Lord of Heaven," Zheng called out, "I know the Myriad Tribulations Body is obtained on the twentieth layer, but how will I be able to obtain the Bone Tribulation Imprints?"</p>

  <p>The Holy Soul Imprints, along with the Bone Tribulation Imprints, were related to the Eternal Scroll Painting and deserved his attention.</p>

  <p>"You'll get the chance when your tribulation skeleton reaches the level of the Myriad Tribulations Body. I don't think it will be long..."</p>

  <p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven was sizing up the glittering gold tribulation skeleton on the other side but his words were cut off by the sudden luster it released. It was like a newborn sun that burned with bright flames and emitted a dazzling light!</p>
