<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 1305 The Roar From A Supreme Lord </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Although Luo Luo Zheng didn't bother concerning himself with the few hundred supreme life vitality crystals, Freya proceeded to carefully divide the crystals in half, splitting them with Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After securely stashing away all the supreme life vitality crystals they had gathered, the two sped up their pace downward. It wasn't long after they realized they had reached the end of the cave.</p>

  <p>Initially, someone else had dug up the area but seemed to have stopped after a certain point at the lower layer of the mine.</p>

  <p>Examining the place, Freya couldn't seem to find any other supreme life vitality crystals.</p>

  <p>"What should we do?" she asked, fixing her eyes on Luo Luo Zheng, waiting for his decision. "Should we change direction and find another cave to explore?</p>

  <p>Or should we move forward and dig this further?"</p>

  <p>Pointing a finger to the ground, Luo Luo Zheng replied, "We will go down!"</p>

  <p>"Down? You want to go to the lowest layer?" Freya's eyes flashed with surprise.</p>

  <p>If they continued digging the cave horizontally, while it would be rather troublesome, they could still probably gather quite a number of supreme life vitality crystals. With their cultivation and strength combined, they could randomly dig up the lower layer? even if the mine caved in, it wouldn't pose much danger to them.</p>

  <p>Going further down also meant heading toward the life vitality jades. She had also heard that eleventh-grade and twelfth-grade beasts awaited at the bottom. While the eleventh-grade beast wouldn't be too difficult for her to beat, the latter would be all too tough for her? they were equivalent to the Spirit Supreme Realm masters. If Freya was unfortunate enough to encounter them, she would be led to her doom.</p>

  <p>In a moment, it hit her how ambitious the Life and Death Realm guy in front of her really was.</p>

  <p>All the while, Luo Luo Zheng maintained a faint smile. He did not need the woman to follow him? if she was unwilling to go along, he wouldn't force her.</p>

  <p>In truth, he thought he would feel freer digging by himself? the feeling of having someone follow him felt like extra baggage.</p>

  <p>After taking two steps forward, he decided on a location. Extending his fist and gently waving it for a moment, the power of two thousand dragon scales gathered in his right fist? he smashed it heavily into the ground.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>In a single, powerful jab, numerous cracks appeared on the ground around him, spreading under his feet.</p>

  <p>Crack? crack? crack?</p>

  <p>Watching him go, Freya couldn't help but raise her brows in surprise.</p>

  <p>'This guy's strength is extraordinary. From the looks of it, he wasn't using his full power in the strike. But his physical strength is probably much more remarkable than mine, even though I'm at the Soul Sea Realm. Is he really only at the Life and Death Realm?' she wondered.</p>

  <p>Then, Luo Luo Zheng threw the second punch.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>The ground covered in countless cracks instantly gave way. Tiny fragments spread in all directions, forming a massive crater of seventy to eighty feet in depth under Luo Zheng's feet!</p>

  <p>Standing in the middle of the huge crater, he began incessantly swinging his fist downward, intending to form a path.</p>

  <p>Watching the scene unfold before her, Freya bit her lip hard. Inwardly, she was hesitant? should she leave him to search for supreme life vitality crystals in other areas, or should she follow him down?</p>

  <p>At the time, she decided to go with her gut feeling? her intuition told her that if she followed Luo Luo Zheng, she would get the task done much quicker.</p>

  <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

  <p>Following the ear-splitting sounds, Luo Luo Zheng continued to sink deeper.</p>

  <p>Seventy feet?</p>

  <p>One hundred feet?</p>

  <p>Two hundred feet?</p>

  <p>Five hundred feet...</p>

  <p>One thousand feet?</p>

  <p>Freya didn't remain idle either? she busied herself with checking the crater's walls for more supreme life vitality crystals, successfully picking up dozens.</p>

  <p>The large pit continued stretching downward under Luo Zheng's continuous stream of punches. After reaching a depth of over twenty thousand feet, his fist broke through the ground. With that, Luo Luo Zheng fell into a cave.</p>

  <p>Before he landed, the chaotic energy in his body circulated, steadying his figure as it floated in air. The debris that fell along with him scattered out of his way before falling to the ground.</p>

  <p>"It's broken! Is this the bottom?" Freya followed Luo Luo Zheng into the cave promptly.</p>

  <p>The caves in front of them seemed to have been formed naturally and left untouched by any humans? they had reached the bottom of the mineral vein.</p>

  <p>There, they had to be extra cautious. Most of those who had ascended to the Upper World wouldn't have dared enter the cave? dangers were probably awaiting.</p>

  <p>Ten thousand feet lay between where they stood and the top of the mountain. Over the past thousands of years, since the mine was formed, it couldn't be penetrated by sunlight. As waves of cold wind blew from the karst caves around, the two took more careful steps.</p>

  <p>But just as they were examining their surroundings, a voice suddenly scared them out of their wits.</p>

  <p>"Supreme Lord Myles! You bastard! You only know how to escape and hide yourself. If you have any guts, come to the Autumn Mountain World! We shall battle it out! Otherwise, I'll be cursing you like this every month!"</p>

  <p>The voice resounded clearly in Luo Zheng's and Freya's ears, putting fright on both of their faces.</p>

  <p>"This should be the Roaring Token?" Freya muttered immediately.</p>

  <p>Although she was also a martial artist that had only just ascended to the Upper World, she knew more about the place than most other martial artists did. Assuming that Luo Luo Zheng was not knowledgeable about this, she continued to explain, "It is said that the Roaring Token is incredibly expensive? a single token is worth tens of millions of life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>Even a world lord of a supreme world wouldn't easily make use of it.</p>

  <p>The one who did spend it is probably a powerful Supreme Lord. I'm afraid that this curse has already spread across all the supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>It's only a curse but it consumed so many life vitality jades...it's too much..."</p>

  <p>A hundred life vitality jades were enough for imprisoned warriors to buy their freedom? tens of millions of life vitality jades was an astronomical number. For a tenth-grade sacred place, it was an almost ridiculous sum of money.</p>

  <p>Much to Freya's surprise, Luo Luo Zheng seemed expressionless and merely nodded his head, indicating that he was already aware of the situation.</p>

  <p>What she didn't know was how mad he was at the man who shouted the curse, shocking him speechless.</p>

  <p>Having received a Roaring Token from the owner of the fairy palace, Luo Luo Zheng could use it limitlessly.</p>

  <p>But while he was busy looking for life vitality jades, he didn't bother finding out who did it, even when the shouting caught him off-guard.</p>

  <p>Instead, Luo Luo Zheng decided that if he had time after getting out of that place, he would use the Roaring Token to curse the offender, regardless of whether or not the person was a Supreme Lord? he wouldn't be able to trace it back to Luo Luo Zheng, anyway.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the Roaring Token was a highly precious treasure to even a Supreme Lord. After the roar resounded throughout the supreme worlds, it halted and disappeared.</p>

  <p>What Luo Luo Zheng had yet to find out was that it was the renounced Supreme Lord Amritpal who made use of the token. The conflict between him and Myles was something of common knowledge at that point? all the living beings in the supreme worlds, from toddlers to old men, were aware that a deep-seated hatred brewed between the two.</p>

  <p>Such was the effect of the Roaring Token.</p>

  <p>Once a month, Supreme Lord Amritpal would use the Roaring Token to lay a curse on Supreme Lord Myles. Because the number of Roaring Tapir was in decline, it became increasingly difficult to obtain the Roaring Tokens? even Amritpal, a Supreme Lord, had to use it sparingly.</p>

  <p>But even though he used it only monthly, each spending was extravagant.</p>

  <p>For a tenth-grade sacred place like the Spiritual Force Sacred Place that had governed an area of almost a twentieth of a supreme world, they could only afford half of a Roaring Token with ten years of revenue.</p>

  <p>What was worse was that the token was so precious that even the wealthiest in status couldn't make a purchase because of the limited supply.</p>

  <p>But this time, the Supreme Lord's roar aroused Luo Zheng's interest. The Roaring Token seemed to be a rather curious thing? he could probably use it to search for Yan if given the opportunity.</p>

  <p>But for the meantime, he had to find the life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>As Luo Luo Zheng and Freya slowly travelled through the naturally formed caves, they could tell how different it was from the upper layers. If any twelfth-grade vicious beasts sensed their presence, they would have no choice but to run for their lives.</p>

  <p>After squeezing through a passageway barely the width of a person, Luo Luo Zheng stepped into some kind of wide clearing. A massive creature lay prostrate within the cave? it had nine heads, all of which were lying quietly on the ground, sound asleep.</p>

  <p>"It's a legendary beast, Nine-head Snake! A fully grown one!"</p>

  <p>"Shh! It's a twelfth-grade beast. You can compare it to a Spirit Supreme Realm master!" "Let's go back!" Freya whispered harshly into Luo Zheng's ear.</p>

  <p>The sight made her extremely vigilant.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng only pointed to something in the distance. "Look over there!"</p>

  <p>In the area where the Nine-head Snake was in a deep sleep, a mass of milky white gems lay. Even though they were over four hundred feet away from them, the two could still feel the incomparably pure vitality of heaven and earth they contained.</p>

  <p>"Are those life vitality jades?" When the milky white gemstones came into Freya's view, her eyes gleamed with excitement. While she knew that the twelfth-grade beast wasn't something she could dare to provoke, she couldn't ignore the pile of live vitality jades.</p>

  <p>If she could obtain them, it would make a third of her task accomplished.</p>

  <p>Even if the gemstones were to be divided between her and Luo Luo Zheng, each of them could still get over ten.</p>

  <p>The weight of the gemstones made her consider the risks of heading straight for them? the Nine-head Snake was no obstacle to take lightly.</p>
