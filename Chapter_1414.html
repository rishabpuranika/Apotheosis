<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The curtain in the Sword Practicing Hall displayed the rankings of warriors.</p>

  <p>If Gorman remembered correctly, the topmost record had been set by Javier, and it was 32 times stronger than a warrior at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Going purely by this, Javier's strength should be more than ten times that of Gorman. However, there were many variables in a fight. Some cultivation methods were extremely powerful, but they might not be able to evoke particularly great power.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was not certain that Javier was definitely ten times stronger than Gorman, but it was certain that Javier was much stronger than Gorman.</p>

  <p>When Gorman's gaze fell on the screen, he was stunned.</p>

  <p>"Three hundred and seventy-nine times? This is impossible!"</p>

  <p>Gorman was dumbstruck for a while, unable to form a sentence.</p>

  <p>In terms of pure power, the number one on the screen was over a hundred times more powerful than him. This person was also more than ten times stronger than Javier, the number one disciple of the Swallow Cloud House.</p>

  <p>"This is impossible," he murmured again.</p>

  <p>A warrior who was capable of invoking such power was definitely not at the Soul Sea Realm. He would at least be a Spirit Supreme Realm warrior.</p>

  <p>This was the conclusion Gorman arrived at.</p>

  <p>However, the strongest disciple in the thirteen palaces was at the Soul Sea Realm. The Mist Palace would not enroll a disciple at the Spirit Supreme Realm.</p>

  <p>'It should be a steward from the Mist Palace. Or maybe an executive, or the palace leader, or some vice palace leader, ' he thought.</p>

  <p>But this was a low possibility, as the Sword Practicing Hall was a cultivation place only used for sword practicing. Gorman had never seen an executive from the Mist Palace practice in here before.</p>

  <p>After all, if they were to practice in here, the records on the curtain screen wouldn't be just a hundred times higher than the power of an Illuminating Soul Realm warrior, it would be tens or even hundreds of thousands of times higher. And the Illusion Space would not be able to bear their attacks.</p>

  <p>As the sky gradually brightened, more and more warriors entered the Sword Practicing Hall. Many warriors checked the rankings on the screen before entering the hall.</p>

  <p>For the disciples of the Mist Palace, this was a glorious place.</p>

  <p>"Three hundred and seventy-nine times? Who created this record?"</p>

  <p>"Am I dreaming?"</p>

  <p>"Could it be Luo Zheng?"</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors present didn't have the qualifications to participate in Passing the Torch, but some of them guessed that it was Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After all, news of the competition in Passing the Torch had already spread throughout the Mist Palace. Even those warriors who didn't have the qualifications to join Passing the Torch had heard about the showdown of Luo Zheng and Layla.</p>

  <p>This time around, the two of them stood out among the thirteen palaces.</p>

  <p>No one from the other twelve palaces could match up to them.</p>

  <p>A warrior dismissed this notion. "It is absolutely impossible for a warrior to be able to display such power with a cultivation below the Spirit Supreme Realm. I admit that Zheng's strength was like a monster's in Passing the Torch, but even he can't achieve this!"</p>

  <p>That day, news of the top ranker in the Sword Practicing Hall had already spread throughout the entire Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>Now speculation was rife among the warriors as to who had achieved such a terrifying result.</p>

  <p>The most popular contenders were Luo Zheng and Layla. Of the warriors in the Mist Palace, they were probably the only two who had the highest possibility of achieving such a result.</p>

  <p>The next day, Layla entered the Sword Practicing Hall under the watchful eyes of the crowd. After seeing the result of the first rank, she entered the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>Layla had also comprehended the Gods-intimidating Strike, but she had only got to 15%. Even with only 15%, her improvement was considerable.</p>

  <p>Unlike the other warriors in the Mist Palace, Layla did not know just how terrifying three hundred and seventy-nine times was. No matter how high this record was, she was willing to break it, regardless whether or not it was created by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>After about five minutes, Layla left the Illusion Space with a confident smile. But when she saw the results on the screen, her expression turned sullen.</p>

  <p>There was some change in the rankings on the screen, but three hundred and seventy nine times still stayed stubbornly on the first place.</p>

  <p>However, Layla's score pushed her up to the second place moving her competitor, with a score of thirty-two times, downward by a single line.</p>

  <p>She had scored eighty-two times by using her full strength in one strike.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't for the incredible score above her, she would have been in the first place for a long time.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem to be Layla," came a voice from the crowd.</p>

  <p>"Then it can only be Luo Zheng!"</p>

  <p>"I still can't believe it. Maybe it's someone else!"</p>

  <p>Layla's mouth pursed, and a look of disbelief appeared on her face when she heard all the gossip. She then turned around and once again entered the Illusion Space.</p>

  <p>Not long after, another second ranking score appeared on the screen, which was eighty-four times. This pushed Layla's previous score into third place, and as for the score that Javier had achieved, it was placed fourth now.</p>

  <p>Layla entered again, and returned having only achieved eighty-one times.</p>

  <p>Eighty-six times...</p>

  <p>Eighty-five times...</p>

  <p>Eighty times...</p>

  <p>Seeing Layla's behavior, the warriors in the hall were speechless.</p>

  <p>This was simply too much!</p>

  <p>Javier's result had been at the top of the ranking list for a long time.</p>

  <p>But now Layla's countless scores were pushing the rest down and off the screen� all except the first place.</p>

  <p>For the vast majority of the warriors in the Mist Palace, a score of over eighty times was impossible to achieve. So in the future, if another warrior wanted to be ranked on the screen, it would be nearly impossible.</p>

  <p>The warriors present were already disheartened. But seeing Layla's monstrous strength, they could only grit their teeth and endure.</p>

  <p>Just like that, Layla continued to rewrite her scores, one after the other, until she finally left the Illusion Space. Her face was pale, as if she had used a secret technique that drained her completely. This time, her score was only ninety-six times.</p>

  <p>In the end, she had no choice but to give up.</p>

  <p>The Mist Palace was in an uproar, but Luo Zheng himself didn't seem to care.</p>

  <p>He still went on with his life in a very orderly fashion.</p>

  <p>He was cultivating and observing the chaotic energy in his elixir field.</p>

  <p>The entire universe was as lively as ever. Occasionally, some creatures would use Roaring Tokens to spread their voices across the entire universe.</p>

  <p>In these past two days, it seemed as if several Supreme Lords had been engaged in a war of words. Moreover, two or three ogre Supreme Lords had also joined in.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng naturally wouldn't participate in this spat among the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>However, after overhearing their debate, he understood that they were fighting over a lost secret treasure.</p>

  <p>After a period of time, the Mist Palace once again welcomed two new groups of guests, and thus, there were new topics of discussion.</p>

  <p>"The Spring Fragrance Pavilion and the Gauze Pavilion have arrived at the same time."</p>

  <p>"It seems like they are going to take Luo Zheng and Layla away."</p>

  <p>"These two are so lucky. I'm so envious of them."</p>

  <p>But they could do nothing. If they could achieve results like Luo Zheng and Layla, they, too, would be highly valued by the Spring Fragrance Pavilion and the Gauze Pavilion.</p>

  <p>After joining the Gauze Pavilion, each warrior was presented a Gauze Token. With this token, one could travel freely through the alliance's supreme worlds. No one was allowed to intercept them. Moreover, as long as they were in the alliance's territory, they would be able to obtain help by showing their Gauze Token.</p>

  <p>Traveling through the supreme worlds was not an easy task for many warriors. Traversing several supreme worlds often meant an expensive price� the toll for travelling within a supreme world as well as travelling between two supreme worlds was enough to consume the life savings of an ordinary warrior. Luo Zheng still had many things to do in the supreme worlds. If this token solved so many problems, he naturally would not refuse it.</p>

  <p>Sometime later, Lincoln, who had fought with Luo Zheng in Passing the Torch, finally arrived at the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>He had rushed straight to the Mist Palace after he was freed.</p>

  <p>He had spent nearly two months reaching this place due to the unimaginably long distance between supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>After reuniting with Layla, Lincoln asked his sister whether Luo Zheng was still in the Mist Palace.</p>

  <p>This made her curious as to why her brother was so concerned about Zheng's whereabouts.</p>

  <p>In her eyes, Luo Zheng was nothing more than the defeated opponent of her brother.</p>

  <p>But Lincoln had told her that he was only able to obtain his freedom because Luo Zheng had let him win.</p>

  <p>Layla was surprised to hear this. She recalled Zheng's indifferent smile and finally understood everything. She was now completely convinced that he was stronger than her in every aspect, be it talent or strength.</p>
