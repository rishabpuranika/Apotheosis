  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Geoffrey stood still, gazing into the distance, Ziya was confused. He couldn't tell why Geoffrey remained motionless.</p>

  <p>The dots of light changing before him left him feeling suspicious.</p>

  <p>In the past, his activities in the Abstruse Energy World were limited to a low-lying area, where he could observe only a few things. Thus, he was unable to distinguish between heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>Now, the countless, densely-packed dots before him confused him greatly.</p>

  <p>It was completely beyond his comprehension.</p>

  <p>Whenever he tried to figure out what those dots of light were, he suddenly felt a splitting headache, as though someone had stabbed him in the head.</p>

  <p>Desperate to relieve himself of the pain, he tried to distract himself from the dots of light. Anyway, he knew it was futile to try to understand what they were.</p>

  <p>"In the center of the four giant pillars, there seem to be some buildings,"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey pointed out.</p>

  <p>Looking far into the distance, he could faintly make out the outline of a huge palace, but it was too far away and hazy.</p>

  <p>After staring into the distance for a while, Geoffrey suddenly pulled Ziya, urging him to keep moving forward.</p>

  <p>Now that he had discovered something new, Geoffrey had no plans of retreating.</p>

  <p>On the way to the four giant pillars, Geoffrey kept Ziya's instructions in mind, cautiously searching the whole way.</p>

  <p>Other than the chaos, they had already discovered two other worlds, including the one with poisonous mist. It was possible they'd stumble upon other worlds on their journey.</p>

  <p>In fact, after having stayed in the Abstruse Energy World for so long, Geoffrey was under the illusion that these weren't real worlds. Rather, they were large caves or some sort of low-level spaces.</p>

  <p>In contrast, everything in the Abstruse Energy World lived in harmony.</p>

  <p>Everything contained energy. The energy in the low-level worlds, like the chaos and the world with poisonous mist, seemed to be hidden. For example, stones, water, and herbs all had energy hidden in their bodies, which needed to be activated by various methods.</p>

  <p>As for the things in the Abstruse Energy World, they appeared as dots of light. These dots of light seemed to be made of energy, and they seemed to be more intuitive.</p>

  <p>Of course, Geoffrey was only theorizing at this point.</p>

  <p>After all, he was able to move with ease in the Abstruse Energy World.</p>

  <p>But to the creatures in those worlds, the Abstruse Energy World was like a nightmare.</p>

  <p>After searching for some time, Geoffrey finally found the fourth world.</p>

  <p>This world was soaked in some kind of strange mercury.</p>

  <p>Spiritual sense was completely blocked by the mercury, so Ziya couldn't use his spiritual sense to scan the world. Moreover, the mercury also affected the Space Law.</p>

  <p>The Grand Teleportation could only transport him over short distances.</p>

  <p>After a few attempts, it finally dawned on him that the mercury was messing with him.</p>

  <p>If he tried to explore this world further, he might've completely lost himself to the mercury. Thus, he decided to return with Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>As they explored the mercury world, Geoffrey told Ziya about the four huge pillars and the massive palace he'd seen prior. Immediately, Ziya recalled the densely packed dots of lights he'd seen, and his face lit up in excitement.</p>

  <p>To their disappointment, they didn't find anything noteworthy in the three worlds they'd just discovered. This couldn't possibly be a coincidence.</p>

  <p>Those worlds must have been destroyed.</p>

  <p>But this didn't answer the question as to how the chaos managed to escape this disaster. They figured they'd probably glean some more information from the four huge pillars.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey made up his mind. Instead of wasting time exploring those other worlds, he headed straight for the four huge pillars.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Ouroboros in the Ultimate Cycle stopped spinning, and the picture in front of Zheng also disappeared.</p>

  <p>But Zheng's mouth still hung open in shock.</p>

  <p>It came as quite a surprise to him that the vast chaos turned out to be a mere tool that generated energy.</p>

  <p>Once he retreated from the Ultimate Cycle, Zheng returned to the first space, where the creatures could multiply infinitely.</p>

  <p>As soon as he entered this space, he felt a chill run down his spine.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously, a strange and cold voice cut through the cold atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to stay here..."</p>

  <p>A frightened-looking boy stared at Zheng, his mouth wide open.</p>

  <p>The first time Zheng entered this space, this creepy boy had chased after him the whole time.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng tried to counterattack, the boy continued multiplying, generating more avatars with each second that passed. Zheng was left with no choice but to escape.</p>

  <p>But now, as Zheng stared down this boy, he felt the ancestry-level bloodline surging within his body, like ripples on a lake. The attributes of the ancestry-level bloodline started to change constantly, and several kinds of energy with life and destruction attributes merged together.</p>

  <p>"I can stay here," Zheng said. As he spoke, he raised his index finger.</p>

  <p>Then, a small gray thing appeared on the tip of his finger, like a gray bug.</p>

  <p>The boy had been smiling mischievously, his eyes dancing playfully.</p>

  <p>However, the moment he saw the small gray bug on Zheng's finger, his expression fell.</p>

  <p>"Waah!"</p>

  <p>With a shrill scream, the boy took a step back.</p>

  <p>He was the incarnation of the origin-level bloodline named Infinite Reproduction, and the energy of the bug on Zheng's finger was completely different from the Infinite Reproduction. It could restrain the boy, so the boy had an instinctive fear of the bug.</p>

  <p>Eyes filled with fear, the boy tried to retreat. But Zheng only needed to take a few strides to catch up to the boy. As he gently patted the boy on the shoulder, the bug landed on the boy's body with ease.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the boy's body began to swell like a balloon. Fist-sized bubbles dotted his skin, and he began to writhe violently.</p>

  <p>Then, he exploded into a pool of blood.</p>

  <p>Zheng squatted down next to the pool and dipped his hand into it. "The origin-level bloodline named Infinite Reproduction has eleven types of power in the map. If this truly is the origin-level bloodline, then the bloodline I just created must also be regarded as the same."</p>

  <p>The small grey bug suddenly emerged from the pool of blood and crawled onto his hand once more. Apparently, Zheng created it instinctively.</p>

  <p>Then, he turned around abruptly to return to the stone platform of the hexagram array.</p>

  <p>He had done this before, so he assumed he just needed to retrace his steps.</p>

  <p>However, when he stepped onto the stone platform, nothing happened.</p>

  <p>Puzzled, he looked down at the stone surface beneath his feet. He sensed that the rules of space and time of the stone platform had changed somewhat.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>With a slight nod, he immediately figured out what to do. The ancestry-level bloodline in his body surged again, transforming accordingly to one with space-time attribute.</p>

  <p>Then, a stream of energy flowed down his arms, then legs, until it passed from his toes and onto the stone platform. Suddenly, the stone platform lit up, and Zheng vanished into thin air.</p>
