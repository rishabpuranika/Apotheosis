<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3504 Dorothy's Affection </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>There was a long and narrow channel inside the energy vortex, and the colored energy bands coiled around each other like pythons.</p>

  <p>The wind beat Zheng's and Dorothy's faces as they moved and flew through the channel at an extremely fast speed.</p>

  <p>The Cloud Flying Wheels helped them adjust their direction, although it was a bit hard because of their highly swift pace.</p>

  <p>At that moment, several energy bands in the distance abruptly rolled up.</p>

  <p>They looked like several pythons jumping and curling around.</p>

  <p>"Be careful on your right. Follow me," Zheng told Dorothy who was behind him.</p>

  <p>In turn, Dorothy tilted the Cloud Flying Wheel to the right, and both of them leaned towards the left of the channel.</p>

  <p>After both of them had adjusted their positions, they successfully brushed past the energy bands without colliding into them.</p>

  <p>"Left!" Zheng shouted. The two of them quickly flew to the right.</p>

  <p>The mist clouds their Cloud Flying Wheels released formed long white lines in the energy channel.</p>

  <p>Since Zheng had warned Dorothy in advance, they passed several dangerous spots safe and sound.</p>

  <p>Dorothy held on to the Cloud Flying Wheel tightly and quietly followed behind Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her gaze swept across the brightly colorful energy bands around her as she lost herself in her thoughts.</p>

  <p>Ever since Feng Ge had arrived in their group, she had never been with Zheng alone like this.</p>

  <p>As soon as she realized it, she began to reminisce and miss the days she had spent in the Sea of Truth. 'I hope this is a very long channel...' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>Just then, a flurry of ripples showed up over the energy channel. Several thick energy bands came down.</p>

  <p>"Down!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was also shocked when he saw these thick energy bands, but he didn't think it would be a problem for them to use the Cloud Flying Wheels to dodge them.</p>

  <p>Just as he adjusted the Cloud Flying Wheel and began to fly downward, he suddenly felt that something was amiss behind him. Dorothy seemed to be absent-minded, as she was flying forward in a blank manner and did not descend like he did.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy!" he shouted as he immediately turned the Cloud Flying Wheel around.</p>

  <p>His entire body spiraled upwards, and the white mist spun around his body in circles.</p>

  <p>As soon he got close enough to Dorothy, he grabbed her with one hand and seized her Cloud Flying Wheel with the other.</p>

  <p>Mist sprayed out from the two Cloud Flying Wheels, while Zheng and Dorothy fell straight downwards.</p>

  <p>They still got to dodge the energy bands above their heads, but because they fell quite fast, they were dashing to the lower wall of the energy vortex at full speed.</p>

  <p>Dorothy was scared silly that she huddled in Zheng's arms, totally motionless.</p>

  <p>When Zheng saw that they were approaching the lower wall of the energy vortex even faster, he gritted his teeth and aligned the two Cloud Flying Wheels right downwards.</p>

  <p>If they hit the lower wall, they would definitely die.</p>

  <p>"Wow..."</p>

  <p>More clouds and mists puffed out and acted as a buffer to weaken their downward momentum.</p>

  <p>The moment Zheng was only half a foot away from the lower wall, they finally stopped falling and began to float gently.</p>

  <p>"Wow, that was so close!" Zheng exclaimed and sighed in relief.</p>

  <p>"How could you space out at such a time!?" he scolded.</p>

  <p>Dorothy, however, just stayed limp in his arms.</p>

  <p>She didn't explain nor refute him. "What's wrong with you?" Zheng asked in confusion.</p>

  <p>He could not see the expression on Dorothy's face, but he could feel that her Soul of Light currently gave out a somewhat loose aura.</p>

  <p>Logically speaking, there was nothing that could affect souls in the energy channel. Therefore, just passing through it would not cause her Soul of Light any harm.</p>

  <p>Now, Zheng had planned to return her Cloud Flying Wheel to her and let her continue to follow him.</p>

  <p>Yet, Dorothy just curled up in his arms and didn't say a word. Thus, he just had to hold her in one arm and grab the two Cloud Flying Wheels together in the other, and flew forward.</p>

  <p>"Dorothy, what happened?</p>

  <p>Was your Soul of Light hurt?</p>

  <p>I have soul pills, um... and soul crystal..."</p>

  <p>Soon after they had left Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore, they arrived at the Desire World.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the pressure on souls was certainly stronger in the Desire World than it was in the Lust World.</p>

  <p>Naturally, Zheng also faintly felt such pressure? but since Dorothy had entered Stage Thirteen of the Other Shore together with him, he believed that she could withstand the pressure as well.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Dorothy just looked at Zheng's blurry face. 'What a fool!' she thought.</p>

  <p>She did hear him ask a series of questions, but she didn't answer any of them. When Zheng finally didn't know what to say next, he moved forward in silence.</p>

  <p>After a while, Dorothy suddenly said in a low voice, "If only this space channel has no end!"</p>

  <p>"You must be joking, Dorothy," Zheng said with a smile. "Even if the space channel does have no end, the energy in the Cloud Flying Wheels will be used up sooner or later.</p>

  <p>By then, we will be transformed into..."</p>

  <p>Suddenly, he stopped talking.</p>

  <p>Even though Zheng lacked a sense of romance, he soon realized that he and Dorothy didn't seem to be talking about the same thing.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng stopped speaking, Dorothy quickly tightened her arms that were around his neck and lowered her head onto his chest. Her lips stretched into a shy smile.</p>

  <p>Clearly, her character was totally different from Feng Ge's.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the Oneness Sky Palace knew that Dorothy was warm and outgoing, but when actually faced with a man she liked, she was very shy and could not express her love explicitly.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, Feng Ge looked haughty and cold. She seemed to keep away from everyone else, but she was straightforward and honest when she fell in love with someone.</p>

  <p>At that point, Zheng's body was a little stiff.</p>

  <p>He had spent most of his time with Dorothy since he had entered the Other Shore, and the two of them had also experienced several life and death crises together.</p>

  <p>Still, he never expected that this little girl from the Origin Mountain would have a crush on him.</p>

  <p>His heart felt warm at the thought of Dorothy using the Heart of Accomplice without the least hesitation in the Chaotic Source World.</p>

  <p>"But I..."</p>

  <p>As soon as he began to speak, Dorothy stretched out her hand to cover his mouth. At the same time, she said, "I don't care about any 'but'..."</p>

  <p>She never had a relationship with any man yet, and just like Feng Ge had said, she wasn't brave enough to confess her feelings.</p>

  <p>When Feng Ge goaded her, however, she began to worry about losing Zheng, and then couldn't hold back her affections any longer.</p>

  <p>Although she was a beloved one in the Origin Mountain, she was very young, and her mentality was not very different from that of any other young girl.</p>

  <p>As for Zheng, he didn't know how to respond to her words.</p>

  <p>Just then, dozens of energy bands rolled up like mad in the channel ahead of them. Energy flowed wildly and vented towards the channel in a deranged fashion.</p>

  <p>It turned out that they had reached the most dangerous part of the vortex.</p>

  <p>"Hold me tight!"</p>

  <p>Of course, Zheng couldn't afford to be distracted. As the two Cloud Flying Wheels turned slightly, he shuttled in multiple directions among the energy bands, like a swallow that flew in a thunderstorm.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, it was not a long journey. After no more than half a minute, they had successfully passed through, and there was no more dangerous part ahead.</p>

  <p>They flew in the peaceful vortex for about five minutes, then they finally saw the exit in front of them.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was about to get close to it, he suddenly felt a strong force thrust upon him. Unlike what had happened when he had entered the energy vortex, this thrust directly pushed him and Dorothy out.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a purple light curtain flashed everywhere in the sky outside.</p>

  <p>The purple light curtain caused a trace of dreamy colors to wash over Stage Fourteen of the Other Shore.</p>
