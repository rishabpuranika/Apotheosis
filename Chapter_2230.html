<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Holy Emperor City knew that while the Han Clan had shown them great sincerity, they couldn't grasp it.</p>

  <p>There was a distinction in rank and status between the disciples of the Han Clan's Floating Island? according to their born status, those disciples could be divided into four grades.</p>

  <p>The disciples with other surnames were in the fourth grade, including Luo Luo Zheng. But his situation was rather special.</p>

  <p>Those in the third grade were members of the Han Clan sub-branches.</p>

  <p>These children differed little from the disciples at the fourth grade in strength and talent, but because they had 'Han' for a last name, they had to be taken care of by the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>On average, the children of the main Han Clan belonged to the second grade. These kids were born and raised on the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, their talent was mediocre at best and they lacked in strength, so their clan could only use certain resources to keep these children from being thrown out? they were clan members after all.</p>

  <p>Those in the first grade, of course, were the elite children of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>These people were considered the pride of their clan, meaning that the Han Clan provided them with almost all their resources and efforts. As elites of the clan's next generation, they bore great expectations from their people.</p>

  <p>The elites included Pascal, who had been in the limelight for years, and Han Liusu, who had just become a low-rank True God.</p>

  <p>Normally, these people seldom appeared in public, but they weren't invisible in the Arena of Legends. Compared to those in the same realm, they ranked extremely higher. Although this group of people made up only a fraction of the Han Clan's population, their points could often determine the ranking of the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God explained it clearly? these five treasures were the best of the best, and the ordinary disciples of the island could only drool over them in the future. Those who could take the treasures out were destined to be the elite children of the Han Clan.</p>

  <p>"Whether or not you're qualified, you need a fair rule, right?" Luo Luo Zheng asked, his eyes crystal clear.</p>

  <p>He was well aware that in this world, there was no such thing as absolute fairness. There was a huge gap in strength between all the Han Clan disciples. While on the surface, these treasures could be obtained by anyone, only a select few could even meet the conditions.</p>

  <p>The mid-rank True God glanced at Luo Luo Zheng with utter indifference? he figured that as a proving godly warrior, Luo Luo Zheng was overestimating his own strength, so he reported the Han Clan's request. "The thirty treasures below need you to add fifteen thousand points in three months, and the five treasures above need fifty thousand. As a proving godly warrior, if you want to get one of the thirty treasures below, you need to win about five thousand battles. If it's one of the five above, you must win about fifteen thousand battles."</p>

  <p>He assumed that the number he gave would put a dent in Luo Zheng's expression.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng remained absolutely calm, giving no reaction but a slight nod.</p>

  <p>A proving godly warrior only got the most basic three points in a match.</p>

  <p>But so long as Luo Luo Zheng won consecutively, the extra points from each would add up. If he worked hard enough, it was entirely possible for him to win fifteen thousand points.</p>

  <p>But his goal lay in one of the five most precious treasures, the Golden Beast Statue. To be exact, he needed the huge plate below the statue.</p>

  <p>Still, it was difficult even for Luo Luo Zheng to obtain fifty thousand points in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Just then, a crowd of people swarmed in from the side of the hall.</p>

  <p>They were escorted by guards clad in gold armor? it was clear that they were of high status.</p>

  <p>"Look, Han Liusu, look! This time, Father finally agreed to take out the precious Golden Beast Statue," a girl that looked seventeen or eighteen years old exclaimed, bouncing up and down in excitement as she pointed to one of the hall's treasures.</p>

  <p>"The voice sounds..." Luo Luo Zheng raised his brows and narrowed his eyes at the sound? he recognized the girl before him was Aleyna, whom he had met in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>When he met her, she was still rather weak, but now she was one of the best proving godly warriors.</p>

  <p>Next to her was Han Liusu.</p>

  <p>She looked much thinner than he had last seen her, with no trace of passion in her eyes. Instead, she looked rather melancholic. But in spite of that, she had become a True God. Although she was still at the low-rank, her momentum was undoubtedly strong, giving Luo Luo Zheng a feeling that she was even more powerful than Pranav, Marko, and Mateo.</p>

  <p>It was surprising to bump into them there, but Luo Luo Zheng had no intention of coming forward.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng had even asked Master Evil how to change his appearance for such situations before coming to the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>In the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, the two helped him get rid of the doubts about his origin? they were well aware of his identity. If they exposed him rashly, he would find himself in deep trouble.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that he didn't believe in them? in actuality, they were very loyal. But Luo Luo Zheng had to be extra cautious.</p>

  <p>"Princess Royal is coming. Miscellaneous people, leave the hall!" one of the guards announced.</p>

  <p>As he quietly sized up the guards, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't find Kennan.</p>

  <p>Presumably, the group of guards in the Han Clan always stayed in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>The news of the Princess Royal's coming gave everyone a shock. These True Gods in the hall knew that the girls were no ordinary folks, but never did they expect one of them to be the Han Clan's Princess Royal.</p>

  <p>"Let's go. There's nothing to see here. Look, the elites of Han Clan have already ordered these treasures," said the mid-rank True God as he shook his head and patted Luo Luo Zheng kindly on the shoulder, suggesting his leave.</p>

  <p>"You're right," Luo Luo Zheng replied, ready to go. But at that point, a woman's voice resounded, calling out, "Tianxing! Wait!"</p>

  <p>Hearing the voice, Luo Luo Zheng paused in his steps, turning around to see a girl clad in a green dress beside Han Liusu and Aleyna? the girl he met on the first day of the Heavenly Han House test.</p>

  <p>At the time, the old man who accompanied the young girl displayed a small sword, making everyone in the house fall silent, keeping secret the girl's identity.</p>

  <p>The muscles of Luo Zheng's face had shifted as he disguised himself the way Master Evil taught him. With a new appearance, he wasn't recognized by Han Liusu and Aleyna, but the little girl in green did, having met him recently.</p>

  <p>The guards in charge of clearing the hall stopped right in front of Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Seeing him seemed to make the girl in green very happy as she turned and smiled at Aleyna, "I told you, there was a powerful talent in the Heavenly Han House and he would be coming to our Floating Island sooner or later. I wasn't lying."</p>

  <p>With that, she ran towards Luo Luo Zheng excitedly.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing, now that you've passed the great test of the Heavenly Han House, why didn't anyone from the Holy Emperor City pick you up?" she asked him all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>Holding a high position in the Han Clan came with access to inside information? she knew that the house had recommended Tianxing to the Floating Island and that he was to arrive. But she had no idea that something had happened? because of the dispute between Yazid and Bentley, Luo Luo Zheng was sent to the Purple Soul Hall in the end.</p>

  <p>So the girl in green had come to the Holy Emperor City several times to investigate, getting no news that Tianxing had entered the city? it was rather odd, in her opinion.</p>

  <p>She was on good terms with Aleyna and Han Liusu, but the elites of the Han Clan weren't only good friends? they were also great competitors.</p>

  <p>When Aleyna and Han Liusu encountered Luo Luo Zheng in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, they came across a series of adventures. When the two girls returned to the Floating Island, they told the girl in green about the story.</p>

  <p>She had been getting an earful about Luo Zheng's stories, seizing the Pristine Life Vitality, single-handedly fighting off a group of top-level elites from big clans of Floating Islands. A twinge of envy came when she heard the tales, for the two girls who met such a strange person in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land? she herself had grown very curious about the stranger.</p>

  <p>After returning to the Han Clan's ancestral land, the girl in green met a genius named Tianxing Luo. Judging from his strength, she figured that even the big clans' elites couldn't measure up to him. The girl was barely sixteen, even younger than Aleyna, but her great competitiveness and ego had her bragging about Luo Luo Zheng when she came back.</p>
