<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The meaningful words spoken by Samuel left Joy, Alfredo and the other Han Clan members feeling stunned.</p>

  <p>It was Samuel, the Holy Emperor of the Han Clan, who made the ultimate decision to curry favor with the Dongfang Clan in recent years.</p>

  <p>Therefore, the people of the Han Clan had nothing to say about it. In fact, even Joy hadn't dared speak her mind, even though she disliked such a decision. After all, the Han Clan, its Floating Island and the clan's property were all created by Samuel.</p>

  <p>Now though, based on what Samuel had said, he seemed to have other plans.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what Holy Emperor is up to," Alfredo admitted. As the master of the Han Clan, he seemed to sense a hint of danger. He had to control his emotion for the greater good of all.</p>

  <p>From Alfredo's and other Han Clan members' perspectives, joining the rich and powerful clans' union wasn't a big deal, and they'd even gain great benefits from doing so. After all, the Dongfang Clan did nearly control almost the entire Hall of Holy Beings. As long as the Sword Clan's and the Moon Clan's Holy Brings didn't say a word, Nicholas Dongfang was the only individual allowed to make a decision in the Hall of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>If anyone wanted to have a stable position in the Time Sea, it was almost inevitable that they'd attach themselves to the Dongfang Clan. The Xie Clan and the Liu Clan demonstrated this perfectly. Both had been the last to rank and became more and more powerful with the help of the Dongfang Clan.</p>

  <p>"It is absolutely impossible for Samuel to demean himself in front of others. Although I don't know what exactly he's doing, I'm afraid that if anyone wants to take advantage of Nicholas, they will drag the entire clan into deep trouble," said Joy hysterically. Then she turned around and left.</p>

  <p>Ever since the Hall of Holy Beings' establishment, the divine land was peaceful for thousands of divine eras.</p>

  <p>Prior to such, Joy had vaguely understood that Mike and Bromley's layout might affect the entire divine land, but she still hadn't thought carefully about her own, nor the Han Clan's future. She hadn't made a clear plan for dealing with everything that was bound to happen, probably sooner rather than later.</p>

  <p>In this moment though, it seemed as though Samuel had a greater foresight than her, and he had already made his choice.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng came to the Floating Island, she had been considering building another island and even thinking about her next opportunity for becoming a true Holy Being.</p>

  <p>'What should I do?'</p>

  <p>As she pondered this thought for a few seconds, Zheng's figure flashed in her mind.</p>

  <p>'Should my choice be simpler?' she thought to herself.</p>

  <p>After the rankings of the Floating Islands were made public, Luo Zheng once again returned to the Purple Soul Hall's practice room.</p>

  <p>After condensing a Godly Tile, he immediately began collecting the Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>The Evil God's movements were extremely fast. The martial artists of the inner world, and even the intelligent creatures from other races, all began to worship Zheng's statues.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, Luo Zheng had seen the Faith Energy in the universe. At the time, Xun's greatest reliance was the Faith Energy consistently accumulated by the Demon Night. This latter energy was considered to be produced by the spirit. After the energy accumulation, certain specific changes would take place. The members of the Demon Night even stored this Faith Energy in the special Pools of Faith.</p>

  <p>More so, the Ancestral Dragon even took Faith Energy as food and grew rapidly by means of such. It was simply impressive.</p>

  <p>However, something very strange had also happened in Zheng's inner world.</p>

  <p>The statue erected in the Emerald Pine City quickly became the holy object in everyone's heart. Every day, people worshiped the statue and gave their Faith Energy to their Creator.</p>

  <p>This amazing statue never needed to be cleaned, as it would not be tainted by any dust or dirt.</p>

  <p>However, one day, after a young warrior finished his worshiping activity, he raised his head, looked at the crowd before him and said, "The Creator! The Creator's statue has turned black!"</p>

  <p>Staring at Zheng's statue in the secret sect set up by the Evil God was a behavior considered blasphemous. The vast majority of people bowed down and looked toward the ground in order to worship the statue. By the time the young man spoke out, Zheng's statue had already darkened.</p>

  <p>In fact, this wasn't only true for the statue in the Emerald Pine City.</p>

  <p>Hundreds of other statues scattered around the world had turned black after a period of time.</p>

  <p>What was even more interesting was that the more people there were, the blacker the statues became.</p>

  <p>"Who has stained the Creator's statue in this way?" someone questioned.</p>

  <p>"Who is bold enough to act in such a way?" someone else murmured.</p>

  <p>"Let's scope the person out and burn them to death!" a voice was heard shouting above the crowd.</p>

  <p>The pious people in the Emerald Pine City suddenly became noisy. They had all forgotten the fact that these statues emitted the sacred and inviolable Mu Ning, and almost no one could approach them!</p>

  <p>Zheng's incarnation and the Evil God appeared in the air above the Emerald Pine City once again.</p>

  <p>The Evil God looked at Zheng's black statue with a puzzled expression on his face and shouted, "It shouldn't be like this! How could Faith Energy cause the statue to become like this? Impossible!"</p>

  <p>According to this world's measurement of time, the Evil God had also collected Faith Energy tens of thousands of years ago, and at that time, Luo Zheng hadn't condensed his Godly Tile yet, which meant he was still unable to use the Faith Energy. The Faith Energy collected by the Evil God at that time still wasn't normal, and Luo Zheng had witnessed the proof with his own eyes.</p>

  <p>And yet, something so incredibly strange happened after the Godly Tile had been condensed and the Faith Energy formally absorbed. The Evil God could feel nothing but absolute confusion.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng walked up and wiped at his statue with his hand, all while wearing a strange expression on his face. He looked at the people kneeling on the ground below it, and then said to the Evil God, "I have to take this statue away first."</p>

  <p>Upon finishing his sentence, Luo Zheng and the statue simultaneously disappeared into the square of the Emerald Pine City. Of course, the Evil God followed Luo Zheng and left, too.</p>

  <p>As expected though, as soon as Luo Zheng took the statue away, the people worshiping it began to wail.</p>

  <p>"Creator, don't abandon us!" they shouted.</p>

  <p>"We are your most loyal servants..."</p>

  <p>As it turned out, these warriors thought that Luo Zheng was venting his anger on them, thus taking the statue away. This however, wasn't actually the case.</p>

  <p>As they continued worshiping the statue at all times, Luo Zheng had quickly become their spiritual sustenance.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng returned to the Emerald Pine City, his mouth twitching slightly. He didn't like the idea of setting up the secret sect, but after he mastered the Godly Way, it was necessary for him to gather the Faith Energy and use it within his inner world.</p>

  <p>Only Holy Beings didn't care about the Faith Energy, because they could use the momentum within the entire universe at will. During the war in the Evolutionary Universe, everything from the biggest beast all the way to the smallest blade of grass, emitted momentum. A Holy Being didn't need to deliberately absorb Faith Energy. Even if someone set up a secret sect in the universe, or if the Demon Night race were to take the Faith Energy, the Holy Beings wouldn't meddle in such situations.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng waved his hand and a brand-new statue appeared before them on the ground, landing with a slight tremble, which made everyone present cheer and applaud happily. Upon doing so, Luo Zheng simply turned around and left.</p>

  <p>The top of the mountain peak was white with snow.</p>

  <p>The black statue stood out against the white background.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng reached out to grab the statue's hand, and with a gentle twist, the statue's stone hand immediately shattered. At the same time, a faint power was emitted from the stone. Luo Zheng looked down at the piece of stone he now held and said, "It's also black inside..."</p>

  <p>The Evil God picked up a piece of stone this time and thought, 'The Mu Ning from this stone is similar to that of the Faith Energy, but why is it black?'</p>

  <p>"The black Faith Energy... What kind of secret sect have you actually built?" Luo Zheng asked, in complete disbelief.</p>

  <p>Because the followers had different beliefs, the colors and auras of the Faith Energy they produced would also be different.</p>

  <p>Xun was the Demon Night race's Queen of Killings. When countless Demon Night members worshiped her, there would be an unanimous killing thought. In other words, Xun's statue was blood-red, and the Faith Energy gathered in the Pool of Faith was like a lake of blood, and the Faith Energy equally contained violent, killing wills.</p>
