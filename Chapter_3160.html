  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the soul sword navigated its way towards Marco at lightning-fast speed, his face began to lose all color and turned as white as a sheet.</p>

  <p>After all, he was the son of the master of Vastness Mountain, and if he were to be killed by Dorothy, there would be severe consequences.</p>

  <p>"You... you wouldn't dare!" Marco roared in frustration, his veins protruding from his neck. Instinctively he closed his eyes shut bracing himself for impact as he had no time to dodge.</p>

  <p>When the distance between the soul sword's pointing end and Marco's forehead was only half a foot long, it stopped in its tracks. Slowly he opened his eyes to see the soul sword had manifested itself into a cloud of soul aura and retreated into Dorothy's Necklace of Mystic Soul.</p>

  <p>Dorothy glared at his frightened pale face to spite him. "Next time, I won't be so forgiving."</p>

  <p>As she finished speaking, she casually turned around and began walking away with Luo Zheng, leaving a shocked and silent crowd behind the Seclusion Door.</p>

  <p>Marco stood still, with a dark shadow hovering over his face. He clenched his fists and kept his gaze lowered to the ground. Although they couldn't see his face, they could sense his Soul of Light was brimming with anger and hatred.</p>

  <p>Scared from the possibility of Marco losing his temper on them, they didn't dare approach him to calm his restless breathing down.</p>

  <p>Silence lingered in the walls of the room before Marco finally spoke.</p>

  <p>"Which mountain does the guy with Dorothy belong to?"</p>

  <p>"We don't know anything about him. We only heard Dorothy refer to him as Luo Zheng," the person standing behind Marco explained.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, huh? I want you to go and look into it. I don't care how long it takes.</p>

  <p>Find out everything there is to know about him!" Marco demanded with rage. His tone reflected how much he loathed Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>In the temple of Taiyi Heaven Palace, there were specific rooms built for the sake of cultivating one's Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>To make one's soul stronger, one had to integrate their soul with rare soul crystal, or constantly harden their soul. However, the latter was far more difficult.</p>

  <p>The soul crystal was also not easy to obtain on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>There was only a small amount of it stored in the temple. Yet, Luo Zheng managed to retrieve a fist-sized chunk of soul crystal. It was quite fortunate of him since there had been no more than fifty people in the Taiyi Heaven Palace who were that lucky.</p>

  <p>Throughout the way, Dorothy remained silent, which spoke volumes about how disturbed she was from what had happened. When they finally arrived at the rooms, she turned to Luo Zheng and lowered her gaze. "I'm sorry to have gotten you involved in such trouble."</p>

  <p>In response, Luo Zheng gave her a warm smile and said, "Don't worry about it.</p>

  <p>Although, that guy seemed to have some bad blood with the Origin Mountain, is that right?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so," Dorothy sighed as she nodded lightly.</p>

  <p>In the past, Dorothy's grandmother took part in a battle where she almost lost her life. Luckily, she was rescued by the master of the Vastness Mountain, after which she was heavily indebted to him.</p>

  <p>Many years had passed since that day until the favor was brought up again.</p>

  <p>The master of Vastness Mountain came with his son to visit Dorothy's grandmother with a proposal of marriage.</p>

  <p>Seeing right through their intentions, Dorothy's grandmother knew that they were only plotting a union through the wedding so they could infiltrate the Taiyi Heaven Palace and gather all its secrets. Therefore she turned them down. Humiliated by the rejection, the master of the Vastness Mountain attempted to impose pressure on her by bringing up the favor she owed him years ago. This caused many disputes between the two groups.</p>

  <p>After some time, the pointless quarreling had subsided, but the grudges remained, which was partially the reason why Dorothy had overreacted upon encountering Marco.</p>

  <p>When Dorothy briefly told him about this matter, Luo Zheng shook his head and said, "The people from Vastness Mountain are too hardheaded. Even though the master had saved your grandmother's life, they shouldn't have mixed it with your marriage."</p>

  <p>"That's why I don't want to talk to Marco." Dorothy rubbed her shoulders with an embarrassed expression. It was obvious the thought of him filled her with disgust.</p>

  <p>Seeing her awkward profile, Luo Zheng attempted to ease her tensed body with a gentle smile. "All right. Let's forget about him and focus on other more important things. Dora, don't let him upset you. First of all, you need to integrate Other Shore Token with your soul."</p>

  <p>"Right, okay." A flustered smile etched across her face when she heard Luo Zheng call her Dora. She bit her lip feeling shy and entered a room.</p>

  <p>After Dorothy went inside, Luo Zheng sighed and slumped his back on the door behind him and fell victim to his thoughts once more.</p>

  <p>There was no denying the fact that Luo Zheng was far more experienced than Dorothy in knowing a person's mindset. After meeting Marco, he immediately understood the matter was not on the straight and narrow; things were going to get complicated from here on out.</p>

  <p>Marco was a different man, compared to Milo.</p>

  <p>Milo might be arrogant, young, and proud, but he was level-headed. He would never get carried away in battle. Luo Zheng knew he was going to face him sooner or later, yet he was not worried about it, as it would be a decent battle.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng's first encounter with Marco was rather unpleasant, as the latter attempted to kill him.</p>

  <p>Thinking about this made Luo Zheng smile bitterly to himself.</p>

  <p>'Ever since I came to this world, I have tried my best to keep a low profile to avoid awkward situations like these. Yet, I still managed to provoke these guys somehow. I feel so helpless...'</p>

  <p>It was useless to keep dwelling over such thoughts. What was destined to happen would happen sooner or later. Besides, Luo Zheng was prepared to face anything because of all he went through to get here.</p>

  <p>Driving his thoughts away, he focused and went into a room too and took out the Strength God Totem. He sat down with his legs crossed. Then his Soul of Light released the Truth of Eternal Sword Intent, and absorbed the Strength God Totem into his soul.</p>

  <p>Quickly, he retreated from the Other Shore once again and guided the Strength God Totem into his inner world, and started to nourish his Other Shore Token.</p>

  <p>After his first experience, Luo Zheng became more skillful at it.</p>

  <p>Last time, Luo Zheng had accidentally caused fear and chaos in his inner world.</p>

  <p>Eye of Will was not a strengthening type of Other Shore Token, and its own Other Shore Power was not particularly compelling.</p>

  <p>But this time he was careful. In comparison to the Eye of Will, the Strength God Totem contained terrifyingly strong Other Shore Power. If it was released carelessly, it would probably shatter the entire world to dust.</p>

  <p>With a fit of shudder in the Thousand Sanskrit Land, streaks of Sanskrit words lit up and danced around in the air.</p>

  <p>A sharp aura that appeared to be in the form of chains extended from the Sanskrit words and swept towards the Strength God Totem.</p>

  <p>'This time, there are one hundred and forty Sanskrit words in total. It seems that it will be more challenging to nourish Strength God Totem as opposed to the Eye of Will.' Luo Zheng continued to process it in his head.</p>

  <p>After nourishment was completed, the chains disappeared.</p>

  <p>Followed by that, Luo Zheng was taken aback as a series of messages rushed into his mind and showed him visions of another race.</p>

  <p>One message said, "Super powerful warriors..."</p>

  <p>The other read out, "Giant Force Believers..."</p>

  <p>He felt conflicting emotions take over his existence.</p>

  <p>It was overwhelming to know he had learned of one more compelling race from the past.</p>

  <p>The Giant Force Believers believed in and gave precedence to powerful strength.</p>

  <p>They thought force alone could solve any problem, and just like the Dreaded Eye Demon race, they also believed in Finale Way.</p>

  <p>This particular race was so formidable that they even managed to control everything in the chaos. They wanted to use their strength to end everything, but in the end, they still failed.</p>

  <p>'Why did such a strong race fail to exist?' Luo Zheng wondered feeling confused, as he attempted to interpret each message.</p>

  <p>Both the Dreaded Eye Demon race and the Giant Force Believer race were superior to the human race. And now, they ceased to exist with only their temples on the Other Shore and had both disappeared in the Source World and the chaos. How was this possible?</p>

  <p>In all the books Luo Zheng had read from the Taiyi Heaven Palace, none of them even mentioned these races. He was baffled.</p>

  <p>Even the messages provided to him by the Strength God Totem were not enough to answer his questions.</p>

  <p>After he removed the avatar in his body, Luo Zheng opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>Carefully, he sat up from his current position and stretched his one arm forward to activate the totem.</p>

  <p>The purple Soul of Light and Dorothy both had doubts about his choice of the Strength God Totem. They were afraid that he wouldn't be able to withstand such a powerful force.</p>

  <p>But still, he wanted to give it a try and see for himself.</p>

  <p>As he provoked the totem, a series of overwhelming aura rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>'Force of one hundred Jun!'</p>

  <p>When the force was concentrated on his arm, a dent formed in the space around his arm.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still able to resist such power.</p>

  <p>'Force of two hundred Jun!'</p>

  <p>He continued to test his limits and doubled the pressure.</p>

  <p>This time, Luo Zheng roughly felt his bones were strained as if a million mountains were pressing down on his arm, squeezing it in between. The muscles became extremely stiff, and the veins in the arm were as tough as steel.</p>

  <p>'Force of four hundred Jun!' Once again, Luo Zheng doubled the pressure.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly a crackling sound filled the room as his arm suddenly caved in under pressure. A stream of his blood spurted out, like a fountain. It sprayed up in all directions uncontrollably. It broke through the enchanted barrier he set up, the ceiling of the house, and left behind a ten-foot-wide crack!</p>
