  <p>
</p>

  <p>The mummy suddenly opened its eyes, startling everyone.</p>

  <p>Especially Malcom, who was standing the closest to Yolande. He suddenly retreated several steps as though he had been bitten by a venomous snake.</p>

  <p>He stared at the mummy warily.</p>

  <p>After all, the mummy used to be a world lord. He had the strength to control the world when he was alive. Now all that was left of him was a corpse, but the moment he opened his eyes, he caused fear in the hearts of the onlookers.</p>

  <p>Yolande glanced at Malcom lightly before saying, "I didn't know how to leave the core area. But I do know now."</p>

  <p>Everyone stared at the mummy carefully, afraid that it might come back to life. They couldn't imagine the strength of a world lord. Even one in ten thousand of his strength might be enough to kill everyone.</p>

  <p>However, along with fear, one more emotion shone in the eyes of the onlookers, and that was greed, just like it did in Malcom's eyes.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the mummy's previous identity, what he offered at this point was a great opportunity for everyone. Even the contents of the skylark bracelet that Yolande just took were hard to imagine.</p>

  <p>Although they all eyed the skylark bracelet, they still had to be reasonable.</p>

  <p>Yolande knew more about the Dark Nether Cave than anyone else, and she said that there was a way to leave this place.</p>

  <p>Opportunities were important, but survival was more important, so was leaving this damn place. They had to get out of the fog no matter what.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, they would die!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, on the other hand, had an altogether different concern. He asked Xun in a low voice, "If Yolande knew her brother died here, why did she wait until now to enter the Dark Nether Cave?"</p>

  <p>He knew that it had been quite a long time since Yolande had entered the Tower of Sin. If her only goal was to collect her brother's belongings, there was no need to wait until now to enter the Dark Nether Cave. After all, the Dark Nether Cave opened every year.</p>

  <p>Xun shrugged her shoulders and said, "I'm not sure." After thinking for a while, she added, "Maybe it's because of you."</p>

  <p>"Me?" Luo Luo Zheng frowned.</p>

  <p>"It's just a guess, but she has been following you from the beginning of the trip to the Dark Nether Cave. Collecting her brother's belongings might not be her only goal. There is some other reason too," Xun said. "That guy called Immortal Mist, who gave you the Jade Butterfly, may also have his own ideas. If you find the inheritance, then you'll have to act according to the circumstances. He may not be a good person."</p>

  <p>It was purely speculation. From Xun's point of view, the human race was an extremely large race in the Upper World, and they controlled many more worlds than the Demon Night. Furthermore, the humans didn't get along well with each other. Wars and conflicts were common among them.</p>

  <p>According to Xun, it was very likely that what happened in the Dark Nether Cave was an internal conflict within the human race and had nothing to do with any other race.</p>

  <p>Xun's only goal was to ensure that Luo Luo Zheng would quickly grow up and bring her back to the Demon Night. Therefore, she didn't want him to become a victim in the human race's internal strife.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng nodded his head. Although Immortal Mist was just a dying soul, he had his own motives. Luo Luo Zheng had to make his own decisions at critical moments.</p>

  <p>He knew that Xun was looking out for him.</p>

  <p>Soon Yolande put her brother's body into her Sumeru Space, which was not like a small world. It couldn't contain living things. If one forcefully put them in, they would be excluded. But if they put a weak living being into the Sumeru Space, it would be instantly killed.</p>

  <p>After collecting the mummy, Yolande took the bracelet out again. She gently bit her finger and squeezed a drop of blood onto the little golden skylark at the end of the bracelet.</p>

  <p>The drop of blood was quickly absorbed by the skylark.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were on the bracelet. Of course, they were aware that Yolande was refining the bracelet. Malcom, Rehaan, Shane, and their companions were dying to know if the bracelet really did contain a Sumeru Space. If so, what kinds of shocking treasures were inside? Any treasure from there would allow these people to reap endless benefits.</p>

  <p>After Yolande had refined the bracelet, she gently touched the skylark and retrieved something from it.</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were burning with curiosity. There was indeed something inside!</p>

  <p>Yolande was holding something that looked like a crab. There was a long metal chain at the bottom of the crab. The crab looked like a small ornament.</p>

  <p>Yolande slowly climbed up from the bottom of the pit and walked toward Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Luo Luo Zheng stared at Yolande.</p>

  <p>"Don't move." Yolande walked in front of Luo Luo Zheng and pulled the metal chain, putting it over his head.</p>

  <p>She hung the crab on Luo Zheng's chest. "This is for you," she said without offering any further explanation. Then she sniffed at him, turned around, and continued walking forward.</p>

  <p>Everyone was at a loss. Yolande was being so cryptic that nobody was able to understand what was going on.</p>

  <p>They didn't dare to ask her what she gave Luo Luo Zheng. Since she was the only one who knew how to get out of this place, they might as well follow her obediently right now.</p>

  <p>Yolande was walking in the front, while Luo Luo Zheng and the rest were following behind. Malcom, however, was at the rear of the group.</p>

  <p>The road they were on previously had been desolate, but now as they got closer and closer to the red dot in the sky, strange things started to appear.</p>

  <p>For example, not too far away from the huge pit that they passed, a huge sword was being stabbed into the ground.</p>

  <p>The sword of the Blood Fiend Emperor that Luo Luo Zheng had obtained from the Cloud Road was huge. However, it dwarfed in comparison to the enormous sword in front of them.</p>

  <p>The giant sword was over a thousand feet tall, even taller than some mountains. Luo Luo Zheng raised his head to look up, but he was unable to see the hilt of the sword as it was shrouded in mist.</p>

  <p>Even the members of the Giants would not be able to wield such a large sword! Who knew what kind of person could use such a huge sword?</p>

  <p>Esther, Fabian, Malcom, and the others all took a fancy to the sword.</p>

  <p>Esther and Fabian originally wanted to use their space rings to store the sword, but soon discovered that it was futile. Even if their Sumeru Spaces could hold the sword, the sword just wouldn't budge.</p>

  <p>Malcom was even more determined than the others. He flew up and stood on top of the hilt of the sword. He held it with both hands hoping to pull out the huge sword from the ground.</p>

  <p>"Ha!"</p>

  <p>Malcom shouted. Ogres were naturally blessed with great strength. Besides, he had eaten the fruit of the Dark Sky Mage, which increased his cultivation a lot. The forceful energy in his body suddenly erupted. Such a violent force was enough to move even a small hill.</p>

  <p>But not this sword. It just did not budge.</p>

  <p>In the end, Malcom jumped down from the huge sword looking resentful.</p>

  <p>"I can't take this sword away!" Malcom walked to the side with his hands behind his back. Having entered the treasure mountain but leaving empty-handed was indeed depressing.</p>

  <p>Now Luo Luo Zheng walked towards the sword.</p>

  <p>"Humph! You think you can pull out the sword?" Malcom sneered.</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng, the weight of this sword cannot be estimated. Even if your strength differs from an ordinary person's, you still won't be able to pull it out,"</p>

  <p>Fabian reminded him.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng smiled and said, "Who said I wanted to pull it out?"</p>

  <p>The moment he said that, Yolande immediately understood what he wanted to do. Xun agreed, "This sword has no owner. Since we can't take it away, it wouldn't be a bad idea to smelt it."</p>

  <p>"Smelt it?" Shane narrowed his eyes and laughed. "It's not that simple to smelt this sword!"</p>

  <p>"This sword of the Upper World has been standing here for countless years.</p>

  <p>The power contained in this giant sword is far beyond what we can imagine. Even if all of the weapon refiners in the world were invited here, they still wouldn't be able to smelt it," Jarrod said and shook his head.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, however, did not speak. He walked to the side of the giant sword and sat down cross-legged. He had already used his black flame before them, and there was no need for him to conceal it. With a blink of his eye, the black flame in his mind shot out towards the giant sword.</p>

  <p>"The black flame..."</p>

  <p>Esther and Fabian had seen Luo Zheng's black flame before, but Malcom had never seen it. The moment the black flame made contact with the sword, a small hole immediately appeared on its blade.</p>
