<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3093 No Room For Retreat </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As the two men hurriedly retreated towards the stern, a ray of golden light suddenly shot out from the body of the three-legged bird.</p>

  <p>The light turned into powerful energy and devoured everything around it.</p>

  <p>The people closest to the three-legged bird immediately exploded and were dismantled. Their heads were instantly separated from their other body parts. Additionally, the entire huge flying ship was broken in two!</p>

  <p>"Now! Charge out!"</p>

  <p>Zheng shouted at Gant who was still shocked.</p>

  <p>After the giant flying ship was destroyed, the enchanted barrier in the outer layer also immediately collapsed.</p>

  <p>The two jumped up and escaped outside.</p>

  <p>The others on the huge flying ship also fled. Their timely decision saved their lives.</p>

  <p>Those who dared to go to the Mountain Viewing Province at least reached the Other Shore Realm. As such, they were rather quick to react when faced with danger.</p>

  <p>"Hoo, hoo, hoo..."</p>

  <p>The broken flying ship fell down.</p>

  <p>More than one thousand people floated in the air and stared blankly at the flying ship.</p>

  <p>The guards of the transmission array had already warned them.</p>

  <p>Additionally, they were mentally prepared. However, the accident happened just when they'd arrived at the Mountain Viewing Province, which naturally took their group by surprise.</p>

  <p>"Quack!"</p>

  <p>At that moment, a strange bird's cry echoed from the sky.</p>

  <p>As Zheng raised his head, his pupils suddenly shrank with curiosity.</p>

  <p>In a higher space, a huge dark cloud floated over. If looking at it carefully, one could tell that it was not a cloud at all.</p>

  <p>Countless strange black birds were flying together!</p>

  <p>The power of a single black bird had already caused so much destruction. If every black strange bird in the flock above them unleashed such power, they would be in trouble.</p>

  <p>"Quick! Run!"</p>

  <p>"The Grand River Fortress of the Mountain Viewing Province is not far from here!"</p>

  <p>"We will definitely die if we are attacked by those monstrous birds!"</p>

  <p>Flashes of space fluctuations suddenly began to appear. The use of the Grand Teleportation technique was the quickest way to flee for them.</p>

  <p>However, just as they made use of the Grand Teleportation technique, several gold threads suddenly appeared. The golden threads seemed to have formed a huge net and immediately covered the whole Mountain Viewing Province.</p>

  <p>Those who had just entered the space channels quickly stumbled and fell out of the channels.</p>

  <p>At the sight of the gold threads in the distance, the warriors couldn't help but tremble in surprise. A look of despair burdened their faces.</p>

  <p>"Is that the Cage of Heaven and Earth?"</p>

  <p>"What the hell? The Mountain Viewing Province is even enveloped in the Cage of Heaven and Earth!"</p>

  <p>"No! It's all over!"</p>

  <p>The set-up for the Cage of Heaven and Earth was a rather complicated and advanced method in the eyes of the ordinary Other Shore Realm warriors.</p>

  <p>The Cage of Heaven and Earth could lock up the space of a province directly. No one would be able to leave even if they used the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>Generally, when two different races were fighting, very few would actually dare to release the Cage of Heaven and Earth. The reason was that the cage not only trapped the enemy but also their own members.</p>

  <p>However, the cage could greatly shorten the duration of the war. The people of the two sides could not use the Grand Teleportation technique to fly back and forth. The limited space would mean that the battle would be very fierce as the retreat of both sides was already blocked.</p>

  <p>The fact that the Sun Crow race was using the Cage of Heaven and Earth only meant that they were determined to occupy the Mountain Viewing Province. They had cut off the escape route so that they could end the war.</p>

  <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p>

  <p>Although everyone was frightened, their instinct to survive still helped them run away.</p>

  <p>"Oh no! What should we do?"</p>

  <p>As he stared at the group of black birds that were getting lower and lower, Gant felt very upset. He wondered how pathetic it would be if he died just after he had arrived at the Mountain Viewing Province.</p>

  <p>"Charge out!"</p>

  <p>In their situation, Zheng couldn't give him a second answer.</p>

  <p>Over one thousand beams of light were rushing towards the north at an extremely fast speed. However, the black birds flew even faster.</p>

  <p>In just five minutes, those black strange birds had already arrived above everyone's head. Terror enveloped everyone below them.</p>

  <p>"Quack, quack, quack..."</p>

  <p>Countless birds let out strange cries which made people very upset.</p>

  <p>"Quack!"</p>

  <p>A black strange bird suddenly broke free from the flock and surged towards the crowd.</p>

  <p>As it rushed down, the energy within its body began to accumulate.</p>

  <p>Afterward, the bird let the energy explode as it approached the Other Shore Realm warriors!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Although the people immediately scattered in different directions, the horrible energy flow still engulfed six or seven of them!</p>

  <p>"What the hell. These strange birds..."</p>

  <p>Zheng's eyes twitched as he watched the miserable situation. A sense of despair dawned upon him.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a group of black strange birds also broke from the flock.</p>

  <p>They hovered above his head and rushed towards him. When he noticed that the strange birds were getting closer and closer to Zheng, Gant shouted,</p>

  <p>"Flag Master, be careful!"</p>

  <p>With intense rage, Zheng's eyes lit up. When he turned over, the long sword in his hand had already flashed a ray of white light!</p>

  <p>"Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship!"</p>

  <p>The Nine-Flash Light-splitting Swordsmanship was a unique kind of swordsmanship. With its elegant slash, it was committed to the pursuit of extreme speed.</p>

  <p>The nine rays of sword radiance didn't spread like the shape of a fan.</p>

  <p>Instead, they actually looked like nine cold stars scattered above Zheng's head.</p>

  <p>They seemed like stars that flew across the sky and disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>"Phew! Phew! Phew..."</p>

  <p>The black strange birds that were about to attack Zheng were instantly cut in half!</p>

  <p>After he eliminated the black strange birds that approached him, Zheng suddenly descended.</p>

  <p>The force that a single black strange bird released could reach over a hundred divine megatons! As such, if numerous black strange birds were to burst out the power, wouldn't it be able to destroy the whole world? Such a horrible thought crept deep into Zheng's mind. A worried look painted his face.</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, those black strange birds that had been cut in halves only fell down directly. Zheng originally thought that they were to explode violently, but fortunately, it did not happen.</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is." Zheng's eyes flashed as he gave a sly smile. With a confident voice, he shouted loudly, "Everyone, don't run away like that.</p>

  <p>These black strange birds won't explode after being killed. Just kill them before they can reach you. Fight and retreat at the right time, and you still have a chance to survive!"</p>

  <p>The explosive power of the black strange birds was terribly scary. No one could resist it. With fear in their hearts, everyone tried to escape. However, their speed was inferior to that of the black strange birds. If the black strange birds burst one by one and released their power, all of them would probably die right away.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Zheng immediately notified everyone about what he had discovered. Excitement overwhelmed all of them after they heard the news.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they could still fight for a way out!</p>

  <p>"Whoosh..."</p>

  <p>Over one thousand people immediately flew forward. As they charged, they also displayed their own theurgies.</p>

  <p>The explosive power of the black strange birds was astonishing. However, their defensive power was extremely poor. Those who reached the Other Shore Realm could fuse with any Other Shore Token to exert the force of at least one divine megaton. After they achieved such power, they could easily kill the black strange birds.</p>

  <p>"Wind Rain Sword Strike!"</p>

  <p>"Sky Sword Stab!"</p>

  <p>All of them violently showcased their skills.</p>

  <p>As they all came from the provinces under the jurisdiction of the Oneness Sky Palace, many of them cultivated the swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>Countless rays of sword radiance brilliantly charged into the sky. All the strange birds that touched the sword radiance immediately were killed.</p>

  <p>Their black feathers were flying in the air while their limbs splashed everywhere. Gruesome innards fell down like raindrops unstoppably.</p>

  <p>The outcome was the same as what Zheng experienced after he cut the birds just now. After the strange birds were killed, they would not be able to explode. It must be because they needed a considerable amount of time to accumulate energy. As such, their threat was greatly weakened.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, there were still too many strange birds.</p>

  <p>A large number of strange birds surged in front of the group. With their numerical advantage, the birds covered the warriors like the lid of a pan.</p>

  <p>They tried to besiege the warriors!</p>

  <p>"Bang!"</p>

  <p>Over ten black strange birds descended earlier and violently burst out their energy again. The spread of energy once again trapped more than ten people ahead.</p>

  <p>The energy force that was erupted from each black strange bird easily reached over a hundred divine megatons. Each explosion was about twice as powerful as the full force of Fergus. Any Other Shore Realm warrior that was engulfed by the black strange bird's energy immediately died.</p>

  <p>Even Zheng was shocked by the devastation made by the strange power!</p>

  <p>"Descend!"</p>

  <p>Zheng gave the order with a confident voice. Immediately, he descended three hundred feet along with Gant.</p>

  <p>When the others heard Zheng's command, they immediately understood what he meant and descended with haste as well.</p>

  <p>They rapidly lowered their altitude and stalled for time for everyone.</p>

  <p>However, a few seconds later, their calamity continued. The black birds above their heads followed them and also descended!</p>

  <p>"Descend once again!"</p>

  <p>Zheng said helplessly as he gritted his teeth.</p>

  <p>He led the crowd to move down a certain height. However, the countless black strange birds also descended.</p>

  <p>That was the only way for them to move forward. However, they were currently in the midair of more than three thousand feet. If they descended for about ten times, they would be left with no room for retreat.</p>
