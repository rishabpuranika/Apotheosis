<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>The Wishing Spell was quite a powerful technique. In fact, when it was used, it could greatly increase the strength of its user in a very short period of time.</p>

  <p>This technique had a catch, though. The users were condemned to fulfilling the wishes they had made, otherwise they would never advance in their cultivation.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, no one dared use the Wishing Spell unless it was a life and death situation. A battle to the death. Once Zheng used this skill, he would have no choice but to kill Pranav, a True God!</p>

  <p>Upon Pranav's arrival here, Zheng had chopped off his arm with the Great Weighty Sword. Although this made Pranav extremely furious, he didn't have the time or the opportunity to revenge himself on Zheng at the time.</p>

  <p>However, at the crucial moment when Pranav had reached his limit and was about to go all out to deal with Wynn, Zheng suddenly reappeared at his side and interrupted him.</p>

  <p>What sent Pranav into a spiraling disarray of emotion was that this basic fellow actually knew how to use the Wishing Spell.</p>

  <p>He knew that Zheng was a Godly Genius, and the Wishing Spell was a Godly Way that nearly everyone in the divine land would have the chance to learn. However, the Godly Geniuses in this universe rarely came across such an opportunity. Zheng had surpassed what was expected of him.</p>

  <p>There were no words to describe how Pranav was feeling right now.</p>

  <p>"It's you! Again, you brat! Get out of my face!"</p>

  <p>Pranav shouted, as he thrust out a hand in an attempt to slap Zheng away.</p>

  <p>He really didn't have the time right now to bother with him.</p>

  <p>On Zheng's behalf though, now that he had activated the Wishing Spell, he was entering a wondrous, dazzling state of mind.</p>

  <p>It was as if everything else in the entire world was left behind, leaving him to concentrate on Pranav alone. At the same time, an invisible force entered his body and he felt it tingling every one of his senses. The power seemed to be coming from some sort of contract.</p>

  <p>Zheng had experienced the wonders of the Wishing Spell once before, directly after he had first mastered this Godly Way.</p>

  <p>Back then, he had used the Wishing Spell on an ordinary beast. After he had activated it, he near immediately felt a miraculous change that greatly improved his physical body, strength, and even psychic force.</p>

  <p>What Zheng didn't know though, was that this power wasn't obtained from anywhere else at all, but was given to him instead... by himself!</p>

  <p>After he made the wish, he believed that he would have the power to fulfill the latter, and thus, he possessed that power. In other words, it was his own personal faith and belief that generated such power.</p>

  <p>This power though, could only be used against the one specific target. If he gave up on killing that said beast and changed his target, he would instantly return to his normal state and he'd lose the additional power.</p>

  <p>Once Zheng had successfully killed that beast and fulfilled the wish, the wonderful feeling disappeared and the world returned to its regular order.</p>

  <p>This time, he was using the Wishing Spell skill on Pranav. The same feeling was now bubbling up inside him.</p>

  <p>Through his eyes, everything else in the world had completely vanished, leaving only Pranav. His focus became pristine.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>His reaction had become several times faster than even Zheng himself had expected.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, there would have been no way to dodge Pranav's slap, but now, with nothing but a slight twist of his body, Zheng avoided it with ease.</p>

  <p>"Gods-intimidating Strike!"</p>

  <p>As all the distracting thoughts in Zheng's mind vanished, his Gods-intimidating Strike became sharper, and with purer power.</p>

  <p>Pranav had previously been victim of Zheng's sword attack and paid the price of an arm. He knew that this world lord's cultivation level was inferior to his, but despite this, he didn't dare take a second sword attack head on. He was taking this battle very seriously. If he didn't, high chances were that he'd be killed by Zheng.</p>

  <p>Without any other option, Pranav gritted his teeth in resentment and pulled out one of the five small swords in hopes that he'd be capable of blocking Zheng's attack.</p>

  <p>Originally, his plan was to use the five small swords in order to kill Wynn. With the five small swords, he could form a Five-element Divine Sword, which was incredibly powerful. Pranav was certain that this was more than enough to kill Wynn, but using the skill would require the five swords to complement each other.</p>

  <p>But because he'd had to separate one of the small swords in order to block Zheng's attack, it was no longer possible to summon the Five-element Divine Sword.</p>

  <p>Several clanging sounds could be heard.</p>

  <p>The small sword, which looked to be as light as a feather, collided with Zheng's Great Weighty Sword, but didn't waver in the slightest.</p>

  <p>Instead, it moved smoothly, almost like a nimble flying snake, as it continuously swerved in the air, trying to find an opportunity to close in and kill Zheng.</p>

  <p>Despite its relentless precision, Zheng's reaction and flying speed had also greatly increased. Furthermore, having activated the ultimate sword intent from the Great Weighty Sword, he protected himself perfectly. The power he infused into the Great Weighty Sword was extremely strong, and every time it collided with the small sword, it would send the small sword flying quite a distance away.</p>

  <p>One second.</p>

  <p>Two seconds.</p>

  <p>Three seconds.</p>

  <p>Pranav had initially planned to end Zheng's life within three seconds so that he could then use his full strength to kill Wynn.</p>

  <p>But once again, Zheng had displayed a strength that far exceeded Pranav's expectations, forcing him to deviate from his devise.</p>

  <p>It didn't take long before a full thirty seconds had passed and Zheng was still vigorously waving the Great Weighty Sword in his hand. Zheng was trying to turn the tables... if only he could find a flaw in Pranav's attack!</p>
