<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Pascal waved a hand, causing a shallow whirlpool to appear within the black sphere in his right hand.</p>

  <p>As he extracted the power of the Abyss Demon Region, the plain that had been illuminated by the sword light began to dim again.</p>

  <p>But Pascal knew that he could only suppress the light and not the power of the sword light.</p>

  <p>The energy in the black sphere surged as he pushed gently with his right hand.</p>

  <p>It rippled like countless tangled black snakes and headed straight for the sword light.</p>

  <p>Pascal thought Tianming's sword strike to be powerful, but the black energy would still absorb it.</p>

  <p>But the moment the black energy met the sword radiance, something strange happened.</p>

  <p>The golden sword light melted while the black energy kept extending. The golden light turned into something that resembled a spider's web and wrapped the black energy into its folds. It then moved towards Pascal at an incredible speed.</p>

  <p>By the time Pascal realized what was happening, the golden energy had already spread all over his body, its beams looking like a knitted net as they covered him.</p>

  <p>The black energy within the net had frozen, and was no longer under Pascal's control.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>Pascal roared.</p>

  <p>Samuel's voice boomed from outside the Mountain of Holy Beings at the same time. "That's impossible! I can control the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>How could its power be rendered useless so easily? And by a mere consummate True God!"</p>

  <p>Pascal's black armor, along with his wings, cracked and fell apart, revealing his body. His face was filled with utter disbelief.</p>

  <p>It was then that Luo Zheng pulled out a long sword and rushed towards Pascal.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>With a sound like that of a whistle, the blood jade necklace on Pascal's chest broke as the sword light flashed across it.</p>

  <p>The blood jade necklace was only a soul weapon, and although it was given by a Yellow Emperor Guard, it had still been unable to withstand Luo Zheng's strike.</p>

  <p>"Hurry up, now!"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng said. Before he could finish talking, No. 9527 had entered Pascal's mind.</p>

  <p>Something that looked like a small bug lay at the back of Pascal's soul. It was the strand of soul from Samuel.</p>

  <p>This was the third time that Samuel had encountered No. 9527's soul. The first two times, he had only felt pity that he lost control of Liusu and Aleyna. After all, Liusu and Aleyna weren't that important. But Pascal was different.</p>

  <p>Now, Samuel enjoyed a status that was superior to others and had the strength to challenge Other Shore Realm warriors. All these were attributed to Pascal. Once Pascal was out of his control, Samuel would be forced to return to his original state.</p>

  <p>"No! No! How dare you break my soul mark! Let me go!" Samuel's soul fragment roared.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 didn't pay heed to him. To it, this Holy Being was no different from dust.</p>

  <p>A cyan light flashed and the bug formed by Samuel's strand of soul turned to ashes.</p>

  <p>Now that Pascal had lost the force that had been controlling him, his eyes rolled back into his head and he fell through the air.</p>

  <p>Before Pascal could land on the ground, Luo Zheng gently pulled at him. In a matter of moments, Luo Zheng had put Pascal's owner-less body into a small world.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Boom!</p>

  <p>The moment Pascal had lost consciousness, the black spheres floating over everyone's heads in the Mountain of Holy Beings exploded and disappeared.</p>

  <p>The darkness that enveloped the divine land was erased, and the divine land was filled with light again.</p>

  <p>Outside the Mountain of Holy Beings...</p>

  <p>Samuel's eyes seemed blank as he stared at the huge silver mountain before him.</p>

  <p>He was smart. He knew exactly what it meant. If he lost Pascal, he lost everything.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>Leyton stepped out of the void and asked, "Samuel, how is the battle going at the Mountain of Holy Beings? Did you kill Luo Zheng and the others?"</p>

  <p>Samuel looked blankly at Leyton and whispered, "My soul mark... Luo Zheng has erased it..."</p>

  <p>Leyton's face darkened at this. "Didn't I give you a blood jade necklace?</p>

  <p>Your soul mark was still erased? Despite that?"</p>

  <p>"There was another person who broke Pascal's defense, and Luo Zheng took the chance to cut off the necklace," Samuel said, his voice weak.</p>

  <p>Leyton's eyebrows twitched and his hands bunched into fists before he punched Samuel square in the face.</p>

  <p>Samuel's body crashed to the ground, creating a large crater. "You're trash.</p>

  <p>What's the point of us having you here?" Leyton barked coldly.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Emperor Guards and Samuel were only taking advantage of each other.</p>

  <p>In theory, once Samuel had released the Yellow Emperor Guards, he became useless to them.</p>

  <p>But Samuel controlled Pascal. With the power of the Abyss Demon Region at his disposal, his strength could not be ignored. This was why the Yellow Emperor Guards were still willing to support him after he had released them.</p>

  <p>And now, Luo Zheng had even taken Pascal away, which meant that to Leyton, Samuel was nothing but trash.</p>

  <p>Inside the Mountain of Holy Beings...</p>

  <p>Sword Chen was floating in the air, his eyes fixed on an arm close by.</p>

  <p>At one end of this arm was the Soaring Snake Sword. The entire arm was cyan gray in color and had completely turned into a stone. That was Tianming's right arm.</p>

  <p>His body had been annihilated by the black energy, and this stone arm was his only limb that remained.</p>

  <p>Some distance away, some Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods were staring at the long sword, a hint of greed in their eyes.</p>

  <p>This sword was definitely not an ordinary weapon.</p>

  <p>But no one dared rush forward and take the sword away, because Luo Zheng was already strolling towards it.</p>

  <p>The fight between him and Pascal had shocked everyone present.</p>

  <p>These two consummate True Gods, had shown strength that had completely surpassed that of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>And the warriors present knew that they could not match up to them.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng landed on the ground, and picked up the stone arm and the Soaring Snake Sword. Even now, Tianming's hand still gripped the sword handle tightly.</p>

  <p>"My father is a little selfish," Luo Zheng murmured. Mike had predicted that this would happen when he had given the Soaring Snake Sword to Tianming. Mike knew Tianming would eventually sacrifice himself.</p>

  <p>"With your talent, it will only take you a few decades to start over again and come back, and I will never let you die," Luo Zheng continued.</p>

  <p>He then pulled the Soaring Snake Sword gently from Tianming's hand and put his broken arm into the space ring. He gazed calmly at the crowd and smiled before saying, "I know what the Yellow Emperor Guards have promised you."</p>

  <p>At these words, the Soaring Snake Sword in Luo Zheng's hand shook and let out a clear, melodious sound.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng continued, trying to sound indifferent, "But Tianming will not die in vain.</p>

  <p>Eleven people have attacked him before and to them, I say, come out and offer your lives to the sword. This is what you have to pay for causing Tianming's death."</p>

  <p>Many people's hearts skipped a beat at Luo Zheng's words.</p>

  <p>In fact, when this group of people had rushed into the Mountain of Holy Beings, most of them had intended to kill Luo Zheng, Sword Chen, and Tianming.</p>

  <p>Some had thought that their own strengths weren't powerful enough and had refrained from taking any action. Some others remained silent and decided to watch from the sidelines. Only a dozen people had attacked Tianming.</p>

  <p>Tianming had killed three of them and then, the remaining ten-odd people didn't dare make a move again.</p>
