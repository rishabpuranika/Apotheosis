  <p>
</p>

  <p>Blood splattered across the ground as the Snake Goddess killed a black snake, then she quickly moved to the next place.</p>

  <p>She wasn't the only one who attacked. Upon hearing her call, Fuxi, the sect, and mountain leaders also jumped into action and cleared the black snakes in the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>However, the area covered by their spiritual sense was much smaller than that of the Snake Goddess. Thus, they could only kill the black snakes near the central area of the Li Shan mountain. They couldn't reach the black snakes beyond that area.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the spiritual sense couldn't be used to locate the three hundred black snakes, so it was quite hard to kill them.</p>

  <p>When they sensed that a warrior of the Li Shan mountain had died, that was only when they could go to the place and kill.</p>

  <p>The wild flames were intense, but the Grandmaster of Heaven had used them to create three hundred black snakes, so the power was divided.</p>

  <p>Warriors at the Holy Soul Realm could resist them, as long as they were careful.</p>

  <p>Although they killed the black snakes, the Li Shan mountain had suffered many casualties.</p>

  <p>Within five minutes, the entire Li Shan mountain was in a fix.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess surmised that after the group of snakes entered the Li Shan mountain, over seven hundred members of the Li Shan mountain had died, which included many elites.</p>

  <p>Although the Li Shan mountain had many members, all the warriors who died were her members. No one could blame her for feeling devastated.</p>

  <p>Soon enough, Yan felt the panic of the people of the Li Shan mountain.</p>

  <p>After all, those mountain and sect leaders contributed nearly half of the energy needed. When they left to kill the black snakes, the energy used for the Energy Shaft naturally became unstable.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Yan was quite skilled. She restrained the blue pillars that grew like mad with constant adjustment.</p>

  <p>When the mountain and sect leaders returned to their positions, the supply of energy to the Energy Shaft became stable again.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, who was in the Dark Haze Peak, also saw the commotion, but he did not act rashly. Before the war, the Snake Goddess said that she was in command of everything.</p>

  <p>Phoenix, Pearce, and some others were in another main peak and infused energy into the Cloud Cover Array as well, but they also did not participate directly in the battle.</p>

  <p>When they returned to the jadeite platform, Fuxi looked calm as usual, but the Snake Goddess was a little worried.</p>

  <p>"If everything continued like this, I'm afraid that the Li Shan mountain won't be able to hold on," the Snake Goddess said.</p>

  <p>Fuxi glanced at the Snake Goddess. He knew that she had a kind heart and didn't want to see her people die.</p>

  <p>However, it was common for millions of creatures to die in such a large-scale war.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid they won't come in," said Fuxi, lost in thought.</p>

  <p>According to the Snake Goddess's plan, everything would be successful if they could trick and lure a Chaos Ancient God into the Li Shan mountain then kill him. Now, it seemed that it was never going to happen.</p>

  <p>While Fuxi and the Snake Goddess racked their brains for a solution, the Grandmaster of Heaven, who was in the distance, shook the Six Soul Flags once more, and hundreds of black snakes dived into Li Shan mountain again.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, it appeared that things just repeated.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess and her people killed the black snakes once again, but more than a few thousand disciples of the Li Shan mountain had died!</p>

  <p>The core disciples were always few. How could they hold off against such a slaughter?</p>

  <p>At that moment, the Snake Goddess turned from worried to aggressive. She looked at Fuxi and said, "If we let the real Snake Goddess and real Fuxi take over our physical bodies, we can fight our way out."</p>

  <p>After she came back to the Li Shan mountain, she talked to the real Snake Goddess once.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess quickly accepted her identity as an avatar. She felt the real Snake Goddess's character and real aura. She was the same as the real Snake Goddess, but the real one lived longer and was more knowledgeable.</p>

  <p>She didn't mind that the real Snake Goddess occupied her body.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the real Snake Goddess remained trapped in Stage Thirty-three and the one she referred to right now was only an energy soul, so she could not really control her.</p>

  <p>However, Fuxi strongly opposed the idea. Even if she begged him in private, he would never compromise.</p>

  <p>But now that the people of the Li Shan mountain were dying one after another and they couldn't find a way to stop it, they had to change their previous strategy and take the initiative to attack.</p>

  <p>The safest way to do that was to let the real Snake Goddess and real Fuxi take over their bodies.</p>

  <p>"No need." Fuxi shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Fuxi." The Snake Goddess stared at her husband. She was begging him.</p>

  <p>Of course, she knew that Fuxi was a proud man.</p>

  <p>Then again, he was the number one warrior when the Chaos Ancient Gods were excluded and was said to be the strongest warrior at the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>Even someone as powerful as Xuanyuan, who had the Element Spirit race's support, was still no match for him.</p>

  <p>Now, to let someone occupy his body was ridiculous.</p>

  <p>Even if that person was the real Fuxi, he still found it hard to accept.</p>

  <p>When he felt that the Snake Goddess had stared at him for a while, he finally felt annoyed. He simply waved his hand and said, "I'll give him only two hours! After that, I will take back my physical body."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the Grandmaster of Heaven was quite satisfied with his attack method.</p>

  <p>In many cases, small tricks often had a good effect.</p>

  <p>The people in the Li Shan mountain guarded the place with all their might, so he naturally wouldn't charge recklessly.</p>

  <p>The best option was to force them out step by step while he waited. That was the most effortless way.</p>

  <p>When he released the fifth wave of black snakes, the situation in the Li Shan mountain far away finally changed.</p>

  <p>The white clouds that surrounded the Li Shan mountain quickly dissipated and revealed the vast, green mountain range.</p>

  <p>As the Cloud Cover Array was removed, an enormous figure, which was millions of feet high, emerged. It was neither Judson nor Gerald, but the real Fuxi, who had activated the Wild God Body!</p>

  <p>The corners of his mouth curved up in relief.</p>

  <p>"I haven't fought for a long time..."</p>

  <p>Then, he spread out his hands, and the blood in his body flowed at insane speeds.</p>

  <p>Compared to Fuxi in this round of chaos, the real Fuxi had more power and control over his bloodline!</p>

  <p>"Clap!"</p>

  <p>He clapped his hands, then two marks of Eight Diagrams appeared on his palms.</p>

  <p>"You can make a move now!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he slammed his hands hard on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Buzz!"</p>

  <p>Othniel and Herbert were both in the Taoism Province. Suddenly, enormous marks of Eight Diagrams appeared under their feet, and the same happened to Grandmaster of Heaven, who was in the Victory Province.</p>

  <p>"This is..."</p>

  <p>Upon seeing the big mark, the Grandmaster of Heaven felt a chill run down his spine.</p>

  <p>In turn, he quickly grew up to ten million feet high. With a wave of his hand, he sucked the black ship into his long sleeve and suddenly teleported away.</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>Powerful palm prints immediately fell from the top of the marks of Eight Diagrams, and a bottomless pit appeared on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven only took away one black ship. The other black ships swiftly turned into thousands of pieces as the palm prints covered them.</p>

  <p>Although these black ships could repair themselves, the captain of the Black Ship still felt crushed when he saw that the black ships were destroyed just like that.</p>

  <p>Still, the real Fuxi didn't stop attacking, and his large hands continuously slapped the ground. As the palm prints kept coming down, the Grandmaster of Heaven, Othniel, and Herbert had no choice but to move and dodge.</p>

  <p>The Grandmaster of Heaven was confused when he dodged and retreated.</p>

  <p>He had never seen Fuxi become so powerful when he fought against him before. It seemed that he suddenly became a different person, which reminded the Grandmaster of Heaven of the Fuxi in the past.</p>

  <p>This was not a good omen.</p>

  <p>Just as Othniel and Herbert still dodged, the real Snake Goddess, the real Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Gerald, and Judson all rushed towards the Victory Province at the same time.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess planned that they would all charge forward to take down the Grandmaster of Heaven first, then deal with the Chaos Ancient Gods next.</p>
