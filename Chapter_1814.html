  <p>
</p>

  <p>The sudden appearance of this elder from the Celestial Position made many Supreme Lords feel delighted and extremely happy.</p>

  <p>They never imagined nor expected that there would be a True God in the Celestial Position. Relief washed over them, for it was a great help for them.</p>

  <p>However, the Sacred race's True God left unhurriedly, leaving his son here, which meant that the other side did not take this True God of the Celestial Position seriously.</p>

  <p>As for Supreme Lord of Original Sin, a smile appeared on his face as he heard Maha's words. "Your father just won't let you die. Get out!"</p>

  <p>After his words, Supreme Lord of Original Sin flicked his long spear. As quick as it was, Maha only felt his vision blur as if a star had smashed into his chest. The explosive impact sent him flying back!</p>

  <p>Watching this scene, the nine Supreme Lords didn't say a single word.</p>

  <p>Then they all soared into the sky, following their Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>"Are we going to let them go just like that?" Supreme Lord of Original Sin indifferently asked as he casually rolled up his spear and held it in his hands.</p>

  <p>The elder merely looked towards the direction they had left and insisted,</p>

  <p>"Let them go. All our chances will be lost once we slay a Godly Genius.</p>

  <p>It is not worth it."</p>

  <p>After the Sacred race were all out of sight, Master Feng introduced this person to the Supreme Lords present.</p>

  <p>Everyone was surprised as it turned out that this elder was the third disciple of the Holy Being. And his name was Wynn.</p>

  <p>Because of the dispute among the Holy Beings, their disciples were either dead or injured. Wynn had escaped into the inner world of the Holy Being, which meant that he had not only managed to escape death, but he had also fallen into a long and deep slumber.</p>

  <p>Many years ago, Wynn only woke up once to activate the bloodline of the Celestial Position.</p>

  <p>Since the Celestial Position was set up by the disciples, it began to operate according to their designated path right after its activation at a designated time.</p>

  <p>Among them, the head was one part of their arrangement, both the Genuine Dragon and Thoughtless Minds were one part of it, while Zheng was the most important.</p>

  <p>It was just that in the beginning, the disciples of the Holy Being had intended to treat Zheng as a secret chess piece, hoping that he would grow in the dark, while Nathan was a distinct chess piece, having all the support of other Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>However, there were still a lot of flaws in the way they operated. No matter how skilled the disciples were, they could not be counted as perfect.</p>

  <p>Thus Zheng won the first place, and in the end, Xenia had become the hidden chess piece.</p>

  <p>But the rate at which the plan was being pushed, already made it impossible for Wynn and the head of the Celestial Position to consider it further. They had no choice but to send Zheng and the others into the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land first.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, no matter how many layouts there were carefully mapped out, it would all be in vain.</p>

  <p>The uproar caused by the Sacred race had caused many Supreme Lords to feel an even greater sense of crisis, especially the Thoughtless Minds led by the four great Supreme Lords. Nathan's clan, Lawson's clan, Lucille's clan, and Janet's clan, they were all descendants of the disciples.</p>

  <p>If the Sacred race occupied the entire universe, they might let other forces live, but first, they would have to eradicate the four great clans.</p>

  <p>Several days had already passed when the Godly Geniuses left the universe and teleported to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>According to Master Feng, the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was a notably complicated place.</p>

  <p>First of all, the world was vast and boundless. It might not belong to the universe, but it was also the inner world of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Warriors from the divine land, as well as warriors from the inner worlds of Holy Beings, dwelt in this so-called inner world. Many good and evil people mixed up together, with all sorts of races also residing in it.</p>

  <p>Besides all these, the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was also an excellent place to gain experience.</p>

  <p>The ten Godly Geniuses simultaneously teleported as if they were in sync. The transmission channel, where they successfully passed through, was no ordinary thing!</p>

  <p>Normally, the Space Law was used in a transmission channel to shorten the distance, not to eliminate the distance.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng's transmission at this time only lasted for an instant. He realized he came to a strange world and knew that this place was no longer the universe.</p>

  <p>"Cave?"</p>

  <p>Zheng instinctively lifted his head to look at the sky and noted that he was in a huge cave!</p>

  <p>It could be said to be 'huge', because Zheng could no longer describe the size of the cave. Its dome stretched as far as his naked eye could see.</p>

  <p>And its height was probably equivalent to the height between the supreme worlds and the stars!</p>

  <p>This enormous cave was so tremendous that it could no longer be called a cave but a world.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be countless specks of light at the top of the cave, alternating between dimness and radiance. Moreover, from time to time, it was illuminated with glittering wave of lights.</p>

  <p>Not only these specks of light brought light to this enormous cave, but they also served as the suns in this cave!</p>

  <p>Due to the distance being too far, Zheng was unable to see what those dots of light were. However, he assumed that they were probably some life forms, stuck at the top of the cave. And as they were able to emit that kind of radiance at such a long distance, these creatures' size might not be small. The tiny dots of light might be as big as a star.</p>

  <p>Though those dots of light looked mesmerizing when viewed from afar, they were not the destination of Zheng's exploration.</p>

  <p>This time when he entered the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, he mentally motivated himself to raise his cultivation as fast as possible!</p>

  <p>As a Godly Genius, Maha was only a step away from becoming a True God. If he could become a True God, then he would have the qualifications to save the universe.</p>

  <p>And as for who was right or wrong, that didn't matter anymore!</p>

  <p>The location of Zheng's teleportation was extremely desolate. It seemed as if he was standing on a flat desert, with not a single soul roaming around.</p>

  <p>But strikingly, there were countless divine textures carved into the bottom of the desert.</p>

  <p>What surprised Zheng was that the level of these divine textures was so high that he had never heard of it before!</p>

  <p>From Zheng's perspective, the divine texture techniques the cyan dragon had imparted to him were already exceptionally formidable. However, when he randomly eyed the whole area, he figured out that the divine textures recorded by the cyan dragon were not even one percent of those divine textures!</p>

  <p>"The divine textures in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land are abnormally developed," Zheng concluded.</p>

  <p>However, he did not dwell on these matters. Instead, he quickly left the desert.</p>

  <p>Before they set off in this journey to the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, Master Feng had carefully explained in detail the precautions in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land.</p>

  <p>One reminder was that there were numerous teleportation areas in the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land. They could appear at any location, but wherever it was, the first thing they must do was to hide.</p>

  <p>The Divine Refinement Forbidden Land was a cruel world. At the same time, dead people could not be reborn, so if one wanted to train there, the first step was to live and keep alive.</p>

  <p>It was an advantage on Zheng's part that this desert was completely barren as it took him an hour to pass through the desert with ease. Not long after, he discerned a grey forest coming into his view. And as he got nearer, he realized that it was composed of stones!</p>

  <p>Zheng rapidly approached one of the trees and leaped lightly, and unknowingly, broke a branch as soon as he landed on the solid ground.</p>

  <p>No matter how carefully he examined them, from the bark to the tree trunk, and then to the leaves, he found they were all stones!</p>

  <p>It was not rather rare for trees to be turned into stones. For example, fossils were often formed when various creatures wallowed in the river of time. This area of the forest might have encountered some unforeseen situations, turning it into stones.</p>

  <p>However, when Zheng felt the life force flowing through the tree trunk, he was sure that the stone forest was still growing. They were born stones.</p>

  <p>"In the Divine Refinement Forbidden Land, anything that goes against common sense can happen. Don't be too surprised. The inner world of every Holy Being is different…"</p>

  <p>One of Master Feng's warnings echoed in Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>After Zheng cautiously had observed the forest for a while, he laid the broken branch back on the ground and stealthily snuck into the stony forest.</p>

  <p>What Zheng did not know was that a gigantic creature had set its sights on him the moment he had entered the forest.</p>
