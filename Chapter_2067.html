<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, in order to escape into the fairy palace, had used the mountain token. It was his last resort.</p>

  <p>On the record, Luo Zheng mainly had three methods of escaping. The first method was the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>However, it would be useless to apply the Grand Teleportation technique in front of a True God. Everyone at Pranav's level would easily block off Zheng's Space Law, and even if he successfully used the Grand Teleportation technique, he could only travel a thousand miles at most.</p>

  <p>He wouldn't be able to escape even from a Supreme Lord at such distance, let alone get rid of a True God.</p>

  <p>The second method of escape was to use the Teleportation Token, which was essentially a Heavenly Destiny. This Heavenly Destiny could create a space for Luo Zheng, allowing him to freely teleport to any supreme world in the universe. But despite the advantage, the speed he would use for the Teleportation Token was much slower than that of the Grand Teleportation technique. If things came to worst, he might be intercepted by his opponent before he could even formulate the space channel.</p>

  <p>The third method of escape was to activate the mountain token, which was a projection of the fairy palace's entrance. For this technique, once he activated the mountain token, he would immediately be pulled into the fairy palace without leaving any sign of the Space Law Power.</p>

  <p>Assessing that the first two methods would have a big possibility of having no effect before Pranav, Luo Zheng had chosen to use the mountain token.</p>

  <p>Aside from his three usual methods of escape, Luo Zheng in truth could also rely on Supreme Lord Healum's Space Lock. However, wherever he was sent to by Supreme Lord Healum, it would still be impossible for him to escape from a True God's pursuit. And since Supreme Lord Healum was busy fighting with the Sacred race's Supreme Lords, Luo Zheng knew that he had no time to offer him a helping hand during this crucial time. He could only rely on his own ability.</p>

  <p>"You want to escape from me?"</p>

  <p>Seeing Luo Zheng suddenly disappearing from his vision, Pranav's mouth twisted in a contemptuous sneer.</p>

  <p>He taunted Luo Zheng since it would be impossible for him to easily flee. He could reach every nook and cranny of the entire Evolutionary Universe in just one step.</p>

  <p>As his eyes glittered with scorn, his powerful soul released a massive mental power that instantly spread out.</p>

  <p>He had indeed noticed that Luo Zheng had disappeared in a strange way. He felt that not a single trace of the Space Law Power was left on the spot at the time he instantly disappeared. Nonetheless, wherever he hid or how far he had gone to, may it be hundreds or thousands of miles, he did not think that Luo Zheng had the ability to escape that far from him.</p>

  <p>But at this moment, something made him frown slightly. As he spread out his soul power throughout the entire supreme world to search for his location, he couldn't be traced.</p>

  <p>He never thought that Luo Zheng was able to escape from the present supreme world in such a short period of time. Not a single sight of his figure nor his presence could be found.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>His invisible soul power continued to spread out. This time, it extended its search over the ten supreme worlds around him.</p>

  <p>But, he still couldn't detect Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>One hundred supreme worlds!</p>

  <p>Even a Supreme Lord wouldn't be able to travel over a hundred supreme worlds in such a short amount of time.</p>

  <p>There was still no trace of Luo Zheng. Impossible!</p>

  <p>At this moment, his eyes started to flash with confusion. He activated his Godly Tile and greatly increased his soul power.</p>

  <p>One thousand supreme worlds!</p>

  <p>The surrounding one thousand supreme worlds had already been enveloped by his invisible soul power.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords of both sides were currently battling and had already expanded the battlefield to over a thousand supreme worlds. Throughout the search, Pranav could easily spot and recognize every Supreme Lord of the Evolutionary Universe and the Sacred race.</p>

  <p>But being unable to find Luo Zheng left him dumbfounded. How was this possible?</p>

  <p>"Hey, Pranav, you haven't let the boy run away from you, right?"</p>

  <p>Observing him at the side, Marko grinned as he asked.</p>

  <p>Just as he finished his words, the five small swords beside Pranav emitted an ear-piercing whistling sound and in an instant, pierced through the air aiming at Marko. He didn't seem to be pulling his punches!</p>

  <p>"I've endured you for a long time, you brat!" Pranav berated in anger.</p>

  <p>Pranav had always been reserved and arrogant.</p>

  <p>He had come all the way to the Evolutionary Universe, only to be annoyed by a world lord again and again. He was already in an extremely bad mood but yet, Marko dared to make fun of him.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment Pranav reached his highest point of patience towards Marko, who had always liked to gloat and had mocked him from the sidelines. Having no way to find Luo Zheng, he felt so embarrassed that he vented his anger on him.</p>

  <p>"Pranav, I was just joking! Why do you have to be so worked up?"</p>

  <p>Seeing the swords charging at him, Marko of course didn't dare to stand still and immediately turned around to evade the attack.</p>

  <p>However, Pranav had already been swallowed by his rage and continued to chase after him...</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>A star in the sky had been shattered by Mateo's finger.</p>

  <p>Mateo had continuously exchanged blows with Wynn for more than a thousand rounds.</p>

  <p>As the fight between the two True Gods progressed, Mateo became increasingly vigorous, while Wynn had appeared to be overmatched.</p>

  <p>Wynn could only escape into the deep space and had to use the star power to constantly obstruct Mateo's attack.</p>

  <p>Although the stars were constantly summoned by Wynn, It was no match to Mateo's powerful Godly Way. Just as the stars were about to hit Mateo, he would simply shatter them all. Throughout the fight, he had already extinguished hundreds of stars!</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>Amidst the fight with Wynn, Mateo still spared the time to take note of what was happening below. He was surprised to discover that Pranav and Marko were battling against each other.</p>

  <p>"Both of you, stop right now!"</p>

  <p>Mateo was considered to be the strongest among the three of them. He usually spoke very little, but had the highest authority. Right when he gave the order, Pranav immediately stopped his attack. He tried to defend himself, "It was Marko..."</p>

  <p>"I know. Marko, stop being mischievous now. Otherwise, I will report your silliness to master. Help Pranav and deal with the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe before things go wrong," Mateo instructed.</p>

  <p>There was a massive gap in cultivation between a Supreme Lord and a True God. With a Godly Tile, a True God's physical body, soul, and life vitality were far beyond what a Supreme Lord could compare to. After all, a Supreme Lord was no different from an ordinary world lord without the Heavenly Destiny.</p>

  <p>But under special circumstances, there was a high possibility for Supreme Lords to overturn such results. There were some of them who had very powerful Heavenly Destinies that could help them to defeat or even kill a True God.</p>

  <p id="top_11">If the three True Gods were the only ones who had been sent to the Evolutionary Universe to battle with the 128 Supreme Lords, the three of them probably wouldn't be a match to the Supreme Lords. However, on this battle, the Supreme Lords of the Sacred race would be enough to fight off against the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe to a draw. The three of them only needed to kill Wynn and then wipe out the remaining Supreme Lords. But in truth, it seemed that Mateo alone would be able to defeat Wynn.</p>

  <p>In order to prevent any unexpected events from happening, Mateo still didn't want Marko and Pranav to be at a loose end.</p>

  <p>Pranav glared at Marko in anger and coldly demanded, "Hand over your Soul Searching Flag!"</p>

  <p>Marko, after being scolded by Mateo, became more obedient. Hearing Pranav's request, he felt quite curious and had to ask, "What do you want to do with my Soul Searching Flag?"</p>

  <p>"I have to find that brat!" Pranav spat angrily. Obviously, he was still resentful about letting Luo Zheng escape from him. For him, even though Luo Zheng was just insignificant in this battle, he still hated to spare his life.</p>

  <p>Marko had also figured out Pranav's intentions. Since Mateo asked him to give a helping hand, he could only obediently bring out a grey flag.</p>

  <p>A grey light instantly shot out from the flag and had connected with Pranav's soul.</p>

  <p>The Soul Searching Flag was a soul-related treasure. Once activated, it could greatly increase one's soul power in a short period of time.</p>

  <p>Originally, Pranav's soul power could only cover an area of 10, 000 supreme worlds at most. But with the help of the Soul Searching Flag, the range of his soul power greatly increased!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>His formless soul power once again surged out in every direction like raging tides.</p>

  <p>One hundred thousand supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>One million great worlds.</p>

  <p>The endless deep space.</p>

  <p>The entire Evolutionary Universe had been completely covered by his soul power.</p>

  <p>From Pranav's point of view, it would be impossible for Luo Zheng to escape from the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>After scanning every corner of the entire Evolutionary Universe, he was completely caught in a surprise as the perplexed expression on his face became more and more obvious. He couldn't find even a tiny hint of Zheng's figure!</p>

  <p>"How was it? Did you find him?" Marko, who was sulking on the side, asked. He always felt that Pranav was too serious and often wasted his time on meaningless matters. Was there any good in trying to kill an insignificant world lord?</p>

  <p>"No! I can't find him!" Pranav breathed a deep sigh. Zheng's sudden disappearance had already exceeded the scope of his understanding.</p>

  <p>"This is really weird. Just forget it. After we destroy this universe, the heavens will collapse. All the living creatures in this universe will surely disintegrate and die automatically. That boy will definitely not be able to escape." Marko didn't have a way to figure it out as well but could only try to comfort him.</p>

  <p>"But it wouldn't be me who killed him," Pranav replied.</p>

  <p>"Is there any difference? Is there any meaning to be so obsessive?"</p>

  <p>Marko could only shake his head. He really couldn't understand Pranav's logic.</p>

  <p>Pranav glanced at Marko and said in a stern voice, "You will never understand the meaning of the word 'meaning.' Therefore, even though your talent is greater than mine and you have more resources than me, your strength will never be stronger than mine!"</p>

  <p>But Marko wasn't annoyed at all and only shrugged his shoulders. He was born to be playful and carefree. He would rather die than become someone like Pranav. "Well, we can talk about this later," he said, "but we need to take actions now."</p>

  <p>Pranav nodded and then lowered his head. His gaze locked onto the Supreme Lords of the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, at this moment...</p>

  <p>After entering the fairy palace, Luo Zheng fell face first to the ground. His golden blood slowly flowed through the cracks on the stones. Weakened and bleeding, he seemed to no longer have the strength to get up.</p>
