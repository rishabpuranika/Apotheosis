<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3262 The Soul Fighting Skill </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Chaim was smart. He knew that the Bearing race was more powerful and that the people from the Taiyi Heaven Palace were no match for them.</p>

  <p>If a conflict erupted with the Bearing race now, the other races that followed the Bearing race wouldn't stand by idly.</p>

  <p>But after they entered the Grand Sky Temple, the situation would change.</p>

  <p>Considering the many dangers and risks in the temple, it would be difficult for the Bearing race to deal with the people from the Taiyi Heaven Palace if they made trouble.</p>

  <p>Chaim's threat left Haider quite restless.</p>

  <p>He clenched his fists and said, "It seems that it's necessary to kill all of you here now."</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>The soul auras of all members of the Bearing race rose in an instant. The tension was so thick, and people were so on edge that even the smallest offense would spark a big fight here.</p>

  <p>Unlike the others, Chaim was not nervous at all. Instead, he grinned and said, "So the mission of exploring the Grand Sky Temple isn't important to you. Our Taiyi Heaven Palace may not be your equal, but we can still kill at least half your people. Do you want to take that risk?"</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace standing behind Chaim were on the alert as well. They were prepared to make a move as soon as Chaim gave them the signal.</p>

  <p>Haider hesitated when he heard Chaim's statement.</p>

  <p>Their goal was the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>It was not wise to fight with the Taiyi Heaven Palace now. If too many members of the Bearing race were killed, Haider would be responsible for the loss.</p>

  <p>The Ear Mice, who were the gatekeepers, observed from the sidelines all this while.</p>

  <p>They didn't care about the life or death of humans. They thought it was better for the Bearing race to die since they had paid the soul pills.</p>

  <p>After brief contemplation, a smile appeared on Haider's face. He then shouted, "Members of the Jin Wu, the Divine Farmer race, and the New Moon race, please help me kill this group of disciples from the Taiyi Heaven Palace!"</p>

  <p>The three races had been on the fence during this discussion between Chaim and Haider. After hearing Haider's call, they stood, one after another.</p>

  <p>The number of people on Haider's side was about a hundred. In Stage Thirteen, except for a small part of the Indigo Souls that had some special innate theurgies, the strength gap between them was not too big. Now that Haider had an overwhelming advantage, the strength of the people from the Taiyi Heaven Palace was insufficient to defeat them.</p>

  <p>A bitter smile appeared on Chaim's face when he saw the other large races support Haider. It seemed that they could not avoid trouble, no matter what logic Chaim presented Haider with.</p>

  <p>"Chaim, what should we do?"</p>

  <p>"Should we run?"</p>

  <p>"But we can't abandon Princess Feng Ge."</p>

  <p>If they fled and left Feng Ge behind, they would become the joke of the Taiyi Heaven Palace.</p>

  <p>Chaim didn't have much time to figure out their next move. The Bearing race, as well as the other races, was already rushing toward them!</p>

  <p>With no other alternative left but to fight, Chaim stretched his hands. In an instant, his arms separated from his Soul of Light and transformed into eight purple long swords.</p>

  <p>"I will stop them. Go rescue Princess Feng Ge," Chaim instructed.</p>

  <p>He had observed the situation while talking to Haider. Now that the battle had begun, he could implement his plan.</p>

  <p>The other members of the Bearing race, who held Feng Ge captive, were on the other side. If they decided to move Feng Ge, they would be at a disadvantage, which the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace could exploit to defeat them.</p>

  <p>"But..." someone hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry. I won't die!"</p>

  <p>Chaim was quite confident.</p>

  <p>As Chaim was one of the top three disciples at the Taiyi Heaven Palace, excluding the Land of Sword Grief, he was as well-known as Feng Ge and Efrain. He also had the ability of Instant Enlightenment, and his soul was even more powerful than Efrain's.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The eight purple soul swords shot forward like dragons, and Chaim began to retreat quickly.</p>

  <p>He was not only powerful but also experienced.</p>

  <p>The Other Shore was a special place. He knew he could leave as long as the Soul Binding Thread did not block him.</p>

  <p>He chose to distance himself from the other party from the very beginning to ensure his safety.</p>

  <p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>

  <p>The eight soul swords flew in all directions and formed a sword curtain that blocked Haider and his group for a while.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the disciples of the Taiyi Heaven Palace rushed toward Feng Ge.</p>

  <p>As those who held Feng Ge captive were unable to deal with the situation, they left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"You have a lot of dirty tricks!"</p>

  <p>Haider was furious when he saw that Chaim's cooperation with the disciples resulted in Feng Ge's release.</p>

  <p>He shook his fingers lightly, and several little snakes flew out. These little snakes were purple-black, and their mouths were wide open. Their ghastly fangs promised an agonized death to anyone who had the misfortune of being bitten.</p>

  <p>As Chaim's arms had transformed into eight soul swords, he could not stop these little snakes.</p>

  <p>He kept backing away, but the little snakes shot straight at him even faster!</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>Those little snakes caught up with Chaim and then entered his Soul of Light.</p>

  <p>"Is he trapped?" Haider was delighted.</p>

  <p>Just then, Chaim's Soul of Light blurred. As he had left the Other Shore unexpectedly, those little snakes only collided with his shadow.</p>

  <p>After Chaim left, the eight soul swords disappeared as well.</p>

  <p>Haider was furious as Chaim had cheated him again. Although anger coursed through him, Haider could not seek revenge as Chaim had left the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"Kill the other disciples! And if they escape, kill the woman!" Haider shouted.</p>

  <p>It was not easy to break free from the Dragon Snake Trap that he had set.</p>

  <p>While the disciples could leave the Other Shore, Feng Ge could not.</p>

  <p>Feng Ge, who was still tied up, was shocked. Did the Bearing race really dare to kill her?</p>

  <p>After Haider gave the order, however, Chaim returned to the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>"It's not a dirty trick. It's a soul fighting skill." His cynical tone enraged Haider further.</p>

  <p>"Screw you!" Haider wanted to tear Chaim apart.</p>

  <p>"The first rule of the soul fighting skill is that once a soul leaves the Other Shore, the soul fragments will also disappear. However, if the soul returns in a short time, the soul fragments will not integrate with it. Instead, they will reappear at the same place from where they disappeared earlier," explained Chaim with a smile.</p>

  <p>At his words, the soul swords that had disappeared with his exit reappeared.</p>

  <p>The people of the Bearing race had left their earlier positions to carry out Haider's order. Now, the soul swords were flying toward them from behind.</p>

  <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p>

  <p>Unable to defend themselves, the Souls of Light of several members of the Bearing race were pierced by the swords.</p>

  <p>A long sword cut Haider as well. He screamed as his Soul of Light emitted a burning pain.</p>

  <p>Although this kind of attack was not fatal, it had a significant impact on their Souls of Light.</p>

  <p>The other races that witnessed this battle from a safe distance, marveled at Chaim's superb abilities and his knowledge of the rules of the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>It was truly worth their respect.</p>
