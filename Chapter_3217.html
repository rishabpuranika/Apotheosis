<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3217 Madam Yasamin </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Both Athemar and Goran were surprised to see the old lady. Their eyes lit up with delight.</p>

  <p>As soon as Calum informed Athemar that Zheng had been abducted, and by whom, Athemar had gone to Goran to ask him to accompany him to the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>Goran immediately agreed. Before leaving, he went to Winchell to tell him of Zheng's abduction too.</p>

  <p>What happened next was completely unexpected. To the astonishment of Goran and Athemar, Winchell didn't come alone. He had brought the head of the Origin Mountain with him.</p>

  <p>The Origin Mountain was headed by Yasamin, whose power was second only to that of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, the great leader of the Oneness Sky Palace. Yasamin herself held an important position in the Oneness Sky Palace as well.</p>

  <p>It was generally known that the stature and glory of the Oneness Sky Palace could be attributed, in part, to the efforts of Yasamin. Indeed, many said at least half of the credit for all the achievements of the Oneness Sky Palace should go to Yasamin.</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect that Madam Yasamin would take an interest in a disciple of the Flow Sword Sect," Gethin said, stepping down from the golden throne.</p>

  <p>He went to Yasamin and reached out a hand to support her.</p>

  <p>The old lady grunted, ignoring Gethin's help. "No need," Yasamin said, making her way towards the throne.</p>

  <p>Gethin cursed her inwardly, but he forced a smile and followed behind Yasamin.</p>

  <p>After a few moments, Dorothy helped Yasmin to take her seat on the golden throne.</p>

  <p>Yasamin sat, exhaling heavily. Then she bent and used her long, thin stick to poke the golden engravings around the throne. Cracks formed on the ground where her stick touched it. "Don't hide now, you two little assholes!</p>

  <p>Come out!"</p>

  <p>There was a puffing sound.</p>

  <p>Two people staggered out of the shadows where they had been hiding, falling to the ground. They were two leaders of the intelligence agency.</p>

  <p>As soon as they were exposed, they scrambled to their feet and bowed to Yasamin, not daring to show the slightest hint of disrespect.</p>

  <p>Although most of the people in the Oneness Sky Palace had never even seen Yasamin, everyone had heard of her legend.</p>

  <p>The thin walking stick she always carried around was her weapon. It was called the Gliding Dragon Sword.</p>

  <p>She was famous for many outstanding feats, including the creation of the Origin Swordsmanship. At one time she had capably guarded the Dragon Cliff alone. People still spoke with awe of how she had killed in one strike a powerful master who lived many provinces away, using the Origin Deity Attack. Many thought of her as the hero who stabilized chaos.</p>

  <p>Moreover, her Other Shore Token was a strengthening type? it had no special ability, but it contained incomparably massive divine megatons of force. Anyone who met her was struck by the formidable impression she made on others.</p>

  <p>Thus, although she looked like a weak old woman on the verge of death, her reputation always preceded her, and everyone went to great lengths to treat her with the proper respect.</p>

  <p>Yasamin didn't waste time with small talk. "Hand Zheng over!" she ordered from her perch on the golden throne.</p>

  <p>Gethin took a deep breath. He had no choice. Even though Yasamin was legendary and the head of the Origin Mountain, he could not give in and just hand Zheng over without a fight.</p>

  <p>He decided to try dissembling first. He gave her a wry smile and said,</p>

  <p>"Madam Yasamin, you have just arrived here. Don't you want to talk about it? What makes you so sure that Zheng is even here?"</p>

  <p>Yasamin was unmoved. "I don't need to explain anything to you. I repeat, hand Zheng over now. I don't care what your reasons were for abducting him."</p>

  <p>She looked coldly at Gethin, daring him to defy her. She was used to dominating everyone around her, and Gethin was no exception.</p>

  <p>Gethin wasn't immune to the pressure. Indeed, if it had been about anyone else, Gethin might have acquiesced to Yasamin's request. However, he couldn't this time. This was about the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>"I apologize, Madam Yasamin, but I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>

  <p>I'm afraid I cannot hand over someone we don't have," Gethin said, forcing his voice to stay calm.</p>

  <p>Athemar, Goran and Winchell exchanged glances. They knew he was lying, but couldn't imagine why he would dare to lie to Yasamin.</p>

  <p>It seemed that Gethin was absolutely determined to obtain the Truth Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>Or was this about something else? Was there some other plot involved?</p>

  <p>They wondered what would happen if Gethin kept arguing with Yasamin.</p>

  <p>Yasamin snorted. "I don't care about your denials. Winchell! Go and search the Vastness Mountain for Zheng," she ordered.</p>

  <p>Winchell snapped to attention. "Yes, Madam Yasamin!" he said.</p>

  <p>Gethin was losing his cool. Dropping some of his deference, he said coldly,</p>

  <p>"Madam Yasamin, this is not reasonable at all. We are not responsible for anyone you might be looking for. Is the Origin Mountain superior to the Oneness Sky Palace? Do you have the right to impose your will on us?"</p>

  <p>The seven mountains were the alliance formed by Eastern Emperor Taiyi.</p>

  <p>No one could command all seven mountains except Eastern Emperor Taiyi, who was the leader of the alliance.</p>

  <p>Although Yasamin had incredible strength and could probably go head-to-head with Eastern Emperor Taiyi in terms of ability, she still had no power to violate the rules of the alliance. She was overstepping her authority.</p>

  <p>What would the heads of the other mountains think when they heard what Yasamin had done in the Vastness Mountain?</p>

  <p>At Gethin's words, a slight look of hesitation appeared in Yasamin's wrinkled face.</p>

  <p>Dorothy pursed her lips. She thought, 'Gethin is truly cunning. What he said is true, and that will make it harder for grandma to deal with him. But we can't give up on Zheng...' She wore a look of anxiety as she wondered where exactly Zheng was and what had happened to him.</p>

  <p>Athemar and Goran also understood the import of Gethin's words and felt worried. They hadn't expected him to have the nerve to stand up to Yasamin like that.</p>

  <p>There was a sudden blast of sound.</p>

  <p>Two people appeared in front of the Mighty Sword Hall, moving too quickly to be identified by the naked eye.</p>

  <p>Gethin and the two leaders of the intelligence agency felt a surge of tension, worried about who were coming. They wished no more people would get involved in this.</p>
