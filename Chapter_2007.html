<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>As Zheng was smashed down, an enormous one-thousand-foot crater was formed in the ground. Supreme Lord Shadow, too, was pretty badly battered by the impact.</p>

  <p>The Great Weighty Sword had been stabbed into the ground.</p>

  <p>The huge square surrounding the Inauguration Altar was paved with a unique kind of solid green stone. In front of the Great Weighty Sword though, the green stone was softer than tofu. So much so that the Great Weighty Sword made no sound as it penetrated directly through the stone, sinking into the soil below.</p>

  <p>The soil of the Rosy Cloud World was even less capable of withstanding the weight and power of the Great Weighty Sword, which kept sinking downward into the soil.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before the Great Weighty Sword pierced through the soft soil and drilled into the rock stratum.</p>

  <p>If it were an ordinary weapon, it would have most likely gotten stuck in the rock stratum, but the Great Weighty Sword was just too heavy. These rocks couldn't support the sword and thus, it continued on its downward momentum.</p>

  <p>Zheng was lying in the pit, an expression of gloom sitting on his face.</p>

  <p>In a battle against a Supreme Lord, strength truly couldn't play a decisive role. It was too easy to be restrained by all sorts of different methods.</p>

  <p>As Zheng lay motionless, the willow leaf stuck to his right hand began acting more and more strange. As it appeared, currently, it could actually completely absorb the power in his arm. No matter how Zheng circulated the power within his body, it disappeared without a trace like an ox slipping into the mud sea.</p>

  <p>For the time being, his greatest advantage was his power. Once his power had been sealed off though, how would he go about dealing with such a situation?</p>

  <p>"Hey, kid, you've suffered a lot now …" Not far away, Supreme Lord Shadow slowly stood up. He stared at Zheng and let out a cold chuckle.</p>

  <p>Only after seeing Zheng get frustrated did he begin to feel a sense of satisfaction in his heart.</p>

  <p>"The outcome is still uncertain!" Zheng calmly replied.</p>

  <p>And that was when Ying sweetly smiled in midair. She opened her arms and waved once more. Under the concentration of pure green life energy, a few more willow leaves appeared. These willow leaves slipped out of her way and floated toward Zheng!</p>

  <p>'Again?' he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Zheng's heart skipped a beat. He still had a chance to resist, even with one of his hands sealed off. If the willow leaves were to cover his entire body, then he would really be finished!</p>

  <p>He suddenly flipped over from the ground and the Space Law began to flicker beneath his feet. However, just as Zheng was about to use Grand Teleportation to leave this place, Supreme Lord Shadow, who was at his side, noticed what Zheng was doing and he suddenly leaped in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>They were linked together by the Death Chain. As they pulled on each other, the ribbon of light surrounding the Death Chain suddenly stretched out straight!</p>

  <p>Supreme Lord Shadow's strength was far inferior to Zheng's. However, due to this unexpected pull, Zheng was unable to use Grand Teleportation.</p>

  <p>Although a large half of his body had already disappeared into the blazing white light, he was now forcibly pulled back out!</p>

  <p>Thump! Thump!</p>

  <p>Thus, they both fell back down once again into the huge pit with loud thumps.</p>

  <p>In the past, this Death Chain had caused Supreme Lord Shadow his fair share of great suffering. Now though, it had become Zheng's restriction!</p>

  <p>As for Supreme Lord Shadow, he was still panting heavily as he lay on the ground. Yet, the corners of his mouth were curled up in a complacent manner.</p>

  <p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p>

  <p>It was too late for Zheng. As soon as he fell back down into the pit, the four willow leaves respectively stuck themselves onto his left hand, his legs, and stomach.</p>

  <p>Within a split-second of the leaves touching his body, the power in those areas disappeared immediately, leaving nothing at all behind.</p>

  <p>Ying's beautiful eyes continued quietly staring at Zheng, as she floated above him in the air, her legs crossed like a genie.</p>

  <p>She'd lost to Zheng in the past and had wholeheartedly accepted the result.</p>

  <p>She even had a good impression of him, but they belonged to different factions. This was what she had to do— it was all she could do.</p>

  <p>"I'll leave the rest to you," Ying said faintly to Yao, before backing away from the scene.</p>

  <p>As the Queen of Life, her cultivation method was originally only limited to assisting her. When it came to a battle where weapons came into play, the Queen of Life wasn't particularly skilled.</p>

  <p>Yao smiled without emotion and then dashed down, like a lightning bolt. She raised the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hand and looked down at Zheng, pity filling her eyes. "You've struggled for far too long. But you know, bugs are bugs. The time has come to put an end to all this!"</p>

  <p>After she finished speaking, rays of dazzling light emitted from the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer and revolved around Yao. The streaks of bright light exploded in rapid succession, one immediately after the next.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>The skinny bolts of lightning warped inward and transformed into several small balls of lightning. These balls hovered above the huge pit, releasing threads of lightning that connected with each other like electrical currents.</p>

  <p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p>

  <p>Once all of the thunder balls were connected together, they began revolving slowly as one, forming a terrifying vortex of thunder. The vortex was like a water tank of thunder, exploding outward in consistent booms.</p>

  <p>And then the vortex began to spin as well. In doing so, it became an intense force of attraction, dragging in rocks, rubble and then the pilgrims' corpses. Everything was sent spinning high into the sky.</p>

  <p>Anything, alive or not, that touched the thunder vortex would be destroyed in an instant.</p>

  <p>This whirlpool appeared to be brewing an unimaginable attack. No one knew what was going to happen next.</p>

  <p>Upon noticing everything that was going on, Supreme Lord Shadow's face grew extremely pale, almost milky white. "Yao, I'm still down here!" he cried out.</p>

  <p>And yet, she knew that he and Zheng were linked by the Death Chain.</p>

  <p>Whatever happened down here, he too would one hundred percent be affected by the attack. Would Yao really kill him, too?</p>

  <p>"She won't kill you," Ying said coldly, a creepy grin on her face.</p>

  <p>Despite hearing her words, Supreme Lord Shadow still wore a mournful expression. Today, he had definitely run out of luck. Karma wasn't on his side. He was destined to meet a calamity like this one. Why did he have to suffer so much just to kill Zheng?</p>

  <p>Deep in the sky, Leroy also watched the scene. His old face was so gloomy, his features hanging so low, it almost looked as though his expression would drop off at any second, just like water.</p>

  <p>No matter what, if Zheng died, Xun's soul would perish too.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, Leroy was afraid that he would never have the chance to reverse the situation that was playing out before him.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng's physical body was ridiculously strong, what Yao used now was known as the Profound Holy Thunder. Attacked by such a vortex of thunder, even a Supreme Lord would perish beneath the power.</p>

  <p>'Ah, what the hell. I'll go all out!' Leroy thought to himself.</p>

  <p>And he knew, now more than ever, that he couldn't hesitate any longer, not even for a second. After heading down toward the ground, he directed himself straight at the fire birds!</p>

  <p>Leroy's entire body was scorched black as the flames raged and licked at him. Although the protective life vitality of a Supreme Lord was extremely strong, it still wasn't capable of resisting Supreme Lord Korbin's theurgy.</p>

  <p>'Is this old man crazy?' Supreme Lord Korbin thought to himself, surprised to see Leroy being so valiant.</p>

  <p>Once he had successfully passed through a fire bird, Leroy finally found an opportunity to shoot. He let out an incredibly loud roar!</p>

  <p>"Yao!"</p>

  <p>The Blood-devouring Bone Arrow, already nocked on the bowstring, slowly began to glow before burning like embers.</p>

  <p>On the bone arrow's head, a blood-red flame lit up!</p>

  <p>Hearing Leroy, Yao, who was still watching Zheng, slightly raised her head. The moment she saw the Blood-devouring Bone Arrow, her eyes didn't shut but twitched and bulged instead.</p>

  <p>'The arrow...' she thought.</p>

  <p>This Blood-devouring Bone Arrow exuded a power that made her heart palpitate!</p>

  <p>'That old fellow!'</p>

  <p>A sense of deadly threat arose in Yao's heart. She was panicking.</p>

  <p>"Release Zheng!" Leroy roared. "And I won't kill you!"</p>

  <p>Leroy pulled his bow back and open, keeping an eye on Zheng as he spoke fiercely and loudly.</p>

  <p>He was staring at Yao, straight on. He had his eyes locked on her. In theory, she had no way of dodging and thus had no choice but to accept the arrow's attack head on.</p>

  <p>Such Blood-devouring Bone Arrows were made from Leroy's ribs.</p>

  <p>The refining process was similar to the burning blood essence method. It was just that when an ordinary martial artist burnt their blood essence, they could greatly increase their strength in a short period of time. Leroy had instead used his own blood essence to create these bone arrows over a long period of time. For this reason, their power was guaranteed to be even more terrifying!</p>

  <p>Once the bone arrow hit its target, the blood flame on the arrowhead would enter the target's body and burn their blood like fuel!</p>

  <p>But the Blood-devouring Bone Arrow was a part of Leroy's life. In other words, every time he shot an arrow, a third of his life was burned to ashes. If he shot three arrows… Without doubt, he would then perish!</p>

  <p>On the one hand, the price was too high.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if Zheng were to die right now, it would be impossible for him to escape. And in that sense, the price was worthwhile.</p>

  <p>"Ha…"</p>

  <p>Yao's face revealed a sneer. Despite her expression, her face was so beautiful that anyone could fall absent-minded upon staring at her.</p>

  <p>"Just having strong determination isn't enough. Are you sure this arrow can kill me?"</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, her tone of voice displayed not the slightest intention of backing down.</p>

  <p>"Let's find out!"</p>

  <p>Leroy shouted back. The golden light in his eyes grew brighter and brighter. As soon as Yao made any unusual movement, he wouldn't hesitate to shoot her with his arrow.</p>

  <p>But Yao didn't seem to care about the Blood-devouring Bone Arrow at all...</p>

  <p>Instead, the expression on her face became more and more relaxed, and she gave a cold, scary smile. "I do want to give it a try!"</p>

  <p>And as she finished speaking, Yao didn't even spare a glance at Leroy before she continued swinging the Saint Thunder Meteor Hammer in her hand. The thunder vortex spun faster and faster, and the Profound Holy Thunder began brewing unceasingly, too.</p>

  <p>When he noticed what was going on, Leroy let out a deep sigh. A resolute expression appeared on his face. He released the bowstring in his hand! Ultimately, he was left without any other choice.</p>

  <p>The moment the arrow shot out, his originally gray hair turned silvery-white; his eye sockets sunk inward by at least an inch; the skin on his face became unusually sallow and wrinkled, and he slowly began to resemble more of a skeleton as he aged anew.</p>
