<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Every time a round of chaos ended, some creatures would flee to the Other Shore. These creatures brought with them their knowledge and recollection of what had happened, so people were familiar with the end.</p>

  <p>As long as one reached the Other Shore Realm, it would be easy to find records and descriptions of the end of a round of chaos.</p>

  <p>It was not a secret. It was simply a disaster that no civilization could survive.</p>

  <p>Most records described it as a huge needle that pierced through the very fabric of the primitive land, smashing everything into pieces, and causing an unimaginable wave of destruction.</p>

  <p>However, this direct description was not entirely accurate.</p>

  <p>The needle only appeared in the final stage of the end. In fact, the end was a series of processes divided into separate stages.</p>

  <p>When the last Shade Stone descended, the entire chaos would rumble and shake madly. It was said that the noise was deafening.</p>

  <p>This loud sound came from the collision between the chaos and the main world. It was like the most powerful thunderbolt, and this also signaled the first wave of disaster in the end. The thunderous sound turned into destructive sound waves, which would spread throughout the entire chaos within three days.</p>

  <p>The weakest of the creatures that lived in the chaos would be pulverized into puddles of blood and gored by the force of the sound waves. The buildings built around the bottom region of the chaos would be the first to collapse, crumbling so thoroughly that they would be reduced to a powdery white mist that blew across the land.</p>

  <p>As for the creatures in the primitive lands, they were much luckier, because they had a natural barrier.</p>

  <p>There was a deep rumbling sound.</p>

  <p>Destructive sound waves quickly spread throughout the chaos.</p>

  <p>However, even before this, the Snake Spirit King had already begun to downgrade the chaos. All the corners of the chaos had been devoured by the heads. Those who had been eaten were gone and could no longer be reduced to blood puddles by the sound waves.</p>

  <p>Twenty eight hours later, the sound waves spread towards the Source World.</p>

  <p>The sentry Evil God saw a slight distortion in the space in the distance. He tilted his head and smoothed his hair, unconcerned. The next moment, his ears exploded, and two spurts of blood gushed from his ears.</p>

  <p>In fact, with his cultivation base, it would have been easy for him to protect himself from the sound waves, but he deliberately chose to experience the impact.</p>

  <p>Since he had been deafened by the shock, the sentry Evil God had to repair his eardrums so that he could hear clearly again.</p>

  <p>The thick outer wall of the Source World offset most of the energy of the sound waves. By the time the sound waves reached the inner parts, their power had been greatly reduced.</p>

  <p>Even so, the rumbling sounds were still far beyond the ordinary sound of thunder.</p>

  <p>Everywhere in the Source World, the sound waves penetrated.</p>

  <p>Initially, the creatures in the Source World were uncertain as to what had happened. They initially assumed it was some fluke of abnormal weather.</p>

  <p>Others imagined it was the sound of some extraordinary warrior unleashing powerful thunder.</p>

  <p>But four hours later, the rumbling sounds had yet to dissipate. Because the creatures couldn't communicate with each other in words, they communicated using their spiritual senses. Some of them couldn't bear the sounds and punctured their ears.</p>

  <p>Soon, more and more creatures began to realize that something was wrong. Some rushed to the ancient books, vaguely remembering something similar, and they found the terrible answer.</p>

  <p>This was probably the last thunder before the end!</p>

  <p>This meant that the end was drawing near.</p>

  <p>Panic quickly spread into every corner of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Everyone reacted in different ways. Some began holding sacrificial ceremonies, praying to the gods to spare them. Some began looking for a place of safety, and many of these creatures hid underground. Most, however, were reduced to pure panic and fear, unable to think what to do next. After all, what was there to be done? Everything in the chaos was about to be destroyed. There was nowhere to escape.</p>

  <p>However, some powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm retained a glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>They had gone further on the Other Shore. They had learned some things from the masters at the Holy Soul Realm and the Eternal Realm. Most of all, they were familiar with the tyrannical Evil God, the current controller of the Source World, and understood just how powerful he was.</p>

  <p>Maybe he would find a way to survive the end.</p>

  <p>In times of despair, when there was no other choice, people were forced to hold on to even the faintest slivers of hope. Soon, the wisest and most powerful people in the Source World had all turned their eyes towards the Evil God, waiting to see what he would do.</p>

  <p>Zheng's primitive land was undergoing the same experience.</p>

  <p>Within seconds, the primitive land was completely enveloped by incessant sound waves.</p>

  <p>However, the internal structure of the primitive land was much simpler than that of the Source World.</p>

  <p>Most of the primitive land was empty. Only the continents, the Pear Hill, and the Ruin Graveyard were occupied. Zheng used a kind of Extreme Form energy to build a huge enchanted barrier to cover these places.</p>

  <p>The enchanted barrier was unable to completely block the sound waves, but it helped to reduce the sound level significantly.</p>

  <p>But although the disturbance caused by the sound waves was alleviated, panic inevitably began to spread across the primitive land.</p>

  <p>Most of the people in the Ruin Graveyard, the divine land, and the continents were fine. The vast majority of them didn't even know what the end meant, and they continued to live without worry.</p>

  <p>But all the people in the Pear Hill were from the Source World, and some of the elites had learned about the end. They recognized the signs and felt a growing fear that the end was about to come.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess didn't hide the news. Instead, she announced it to the public.</p>

  <p>She knew it would cause a panic, but she felt that everyone had the right to know, and to face this moment in the best way they chose.</p>

  <p>At the top of the divine land, many Holy Beings gathered together. They had been summoned by Mike and did not yet know what had happened.</p>

  <p>Mike stood with his hands behind his back and solemnly told them that the end had arrived. This information was news to them.</p>

  <p>The Holy Beings had been calm despite the strange, muted rumbling sounds, but now their whole demeanor changed.</p>

  <p>The current divine land was so peaceful. They had never thought that such a disaster could strike without warning.</p>

  <p>Like the wise warriors in the Source World, they quickly considered their options, and decided to place all their hopes on Zheng.</p>

  <p>"Your son could create a world that is so many times larger than the divine land. Can't he deal with the end?" said one of the Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything in the chaos that Zheng can't do?" another said.</p>

  <p>"We believe he will make it!"</p>

  <p>Zheng was their only hope, and the Holy Beings put their faith in his abilities.</p>

  <p>Of course, Mike knew what they were thinking. He smiled bitterly but did not contradict them. Although he and the Holy Beings were powerful in the divine land, they didn't even have the right to speak when the end came.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the fairy palace, Geoffrey stood in the empty courtyard and looked up at the sky.</p>

  <p>He was highly sensitive, and his perception of energy fluctuations was far stronger than that of ordinary people. It was even stronger than Zheng's.</p>

  <p>"Geoffrey," Yudie called at the gate. She gazed at him as he stood with his back towards her.</p>

  <p>After a moment, Geoffrey turned around, smiling. "Mother, it begins."</p>

  <p>Yudie nodded. She knew what Geoffrey meant.</p>

  <p>"I want to fight. I want to protect this world and you," Geoffrey said. His tone was grim, almost fanatic in his determination.</p>

  <p>For the first time, Yudie didn't object. Instead, she nodded, her eyes shining.</p>

  <p>In the Ruin Graveyard, Tianming sat on a broken giant tombstone. In his hand was the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>He had mastered the methods that Kincaid taught him. He was now capable of unleashing the full power of the Lone Sword.</p>

  <p>He had never regarded the survival from the end as his goal. Indeed, before this, he hadn't even known much about it.</p>

  <p>However, he did not plan to wait passively for the end. He was ready to act at a moment's notice.</p>
