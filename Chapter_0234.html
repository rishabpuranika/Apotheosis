  <p>A loud, rough rumble resonated from the rocky statue. Everyone's eyes were trained on the floating object.</p>

  <p>The first statue was slowly dragged on the character "heaven." The floor slightly vibrated as it did so.</p>

  <p>As he watched the scene unfold, Luo Luo Zheng briefly remembered that Chase once wrote the number "three" beside "heaven" in his book. Thus, he assumed that three statues should be moved to the word "heaven".</p>

  <p>Once the long-haired woman finished putting the first statue in place, she lowered her head and began to calculate again. When she got the result, she sent a second statue to where "heaven" was for the second time.</p>

  <p>Shortly after, the woman had done the next calculation and moved a third statue to "heaven" for the last time.</p>

  <p>A slight nod was given by Luo Luo Zheng. It seemed that she appeared too modest when she claimed that she was not skilled at the Eight Diagrams. Her calculation on the first character was exactly the same as the book written by Chase. He only hoped that she could calculate all the next succeeding characters correctly.</p>

  <p>When the three statues were finally placed on the character "heaven," the big "heaven" name carving emitted a golden light--the woman had done it right.</p>

  <p>The positive outcome made everyone brim with confidence.</p>

  <p>"Sandra's knowledge of formation is extraordinary!"</p>

  <p>"How could she merely be proficient? She is qualified to be a formation master!"</p>

  <p>The rest of the Illuminating Soul Realm masters showered her with flattery and other words of praise.</p>

  <p>In return, Sandra only shook her head and slicked back her long hair.</p>

  <p>"Don't count the chickens before they hatch. It's the easiest to work out the first character of the formation. Deciphering a formation becomes harder and harder along the way. The chances of failing become bigger as the calculation gets more complicated," she said.</p>

  <p>After she finished her talk, her head lowered once again. Then she continued to work on the calculations.</p>

  <p>Six statues were next struck on the character "Earth," and this step she performed was also exact the same as stated in Chase's book.</p>

  <p>This correct move gave Luo Luo Zheng a confidence boost as well, as she got two consecutive calculations right.</p>

  <p>Next, Sandra placed two statues on the "Water" character, and then nine statues on the "Fire".</p>

  <p>The calculations she did for the first four characters were all correct, as bright golden rays of light emanated from all of them. The light was dazzling, but the real excitement came from the characters as everyone was firmly transfixed on them.</p>

  <p>"It seems that this adventure will fare well after nearly so many misses.</p>

  <p>We can get the supreme treasures of the immortals soon," one Illuminating Soul Realm master exclaimed in excitement.</p>

  <p>The calculations for the next four characters proceeded.</p>

  <p>The next one up was the character, "Valley."</p>

  <p>If Luo Luo Zheng remembered correctly, Chase wrote "four" beside "Valley" which meant four statues were to be moved to the character.</p>

  <p>Life vitality was unceasingly released from Sandra's being, and she struck four statues in a row towards "Valley." After the fourth statue was in place, she proceeded to drag a fifth one.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" someone yelled abruptly.</p>

  <p>It was Luo Luo Zheng, and the moment Sandra began to drag a fifth statue he wasted no time in stopping her.</p>

  <p>It was a crucial calculation that allowed for no mishaps, so Luo Luo Zheng didn't want her to make any mistakes that would trigger the trap of the Immortal Mansion and bring them all to hell.</p>

  <p>However, one of them did not seem to agree.</p>

  <p>"You stinking brat! What are you doing?" Wilson Huang stared at him and asked angrily.</p>

  <p>Yet, Luo Luo Zheng paid him no mind and shifted his attention to Sandra. "On the 'Valley' character, you should only put four statues, right? Are you sure it's correct to strike one more statue?" he asked.</p>

  <p>A frown made its way to Sandra's face and she looked a little hesitant.</p>

  <p>She paused momentarily and thought about her calculation.</p>

  <p>"I did the calculation and I am also not sure whether my answer is right.</p>

  <p>I'm not very sure whether it's four or five statues?"</p>

  <p>At her response, Luo Luo Zheng shook his head and firmly said, "Then it should be four."</p>

  <p>However, Sandra still looked a bit doubtful.</p>

  <p>"Was I wrong? But the result I calculated seemed to be five," she said with uncertainty.</p>

  <p>Just then, an Illuminating Soul Realm master suddenly said, "Then just move five statues there. Sandra, don't listen to the bullshit of this brat.</p>

  <p>He's so disturbing!" "Stinking brat, we are already very gracious not to have killed you. If you continue to talk nonsense and interrupt Sandra, I will kill you immediately!" he added.</p>

  <p>Wilson again echoed his sentiments and nodded in agreement. "Don't be muddled by this brat. He only wants all of us to die with him. What a vicious boy!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Anxiety crept its way to Luo Zheng's thoughts when he saw these two people act so unreasonably against him. "We sink or swim together. What makes you think that I will lie to you?" he asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" Wilson yelled and cut him off.</p>

  <p>Life vitality constantly flashed on his body, "Stinking brat, talk one more time and I'll kill you immediately!" he angrily added.</p>

  <p>Now, Seymour and other several Illuminating Soul Realm masters also activated the life vitality within their bodies. Their figures emitted bright flashes of light and terrifying power.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng felt pressed, so he had no choice but to shut up.</p>

  <p>After a bit of hesitation, Sandra bit her bottom lip and finally chose to believe in herself.</p>

  <p>Once again, a rocky rumbling sound was heard from a statue.</p>

  <p>A fifth one was moved towards "Valley." Once it was placed into position, a click sound was heard, followed by the sight of "Valley" turning into a blood red glow instead of the supposed golden flash of light.</p>

  <p>Everyone's faces were drained of color, and only then did they realize that Luo Luo Zheng was right.</p>

  <p>Then again, it was already too late for regrets. There was no use crying over spilled milk.</p>

  <p>They felt the ground shake a bit as the Eight Diagrams suddenly began to rotate. When they gradually came to a halt, a white and black mist came out from the Eight Diagrams and formed several characters.</p>

  <p>The writing read, "Desperate Melee!"</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"It's ominous! We must have fallen into a trap!"</p>

  <p>All the Illuminating Soul Realm masters exclaimed in horror, their faces ghastly pale. The Immortal Mansion was a dangerous place, and they were doomed this time.</p>
