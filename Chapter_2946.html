<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2946 Return To The Cloud Hall </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Luo Zheng was lost for words after Aleyna's remark.</p>

  <p>"At least he didn't say that to his first woman," Liusu said as she nudged Aleyna's arm playfully with her elbow.</p>

  <p>He sighed to himself and raised his hands as if surrendering to the girls.</p>

  <p>With a swift wave of his hands, he opened the passageway to the Evolutionary Universe out of thin air.</p>

  <p>Before entering the Mountain of Holy Beings, Luo Zheng had sent Yudie, Margaret, and the others to the Evolutionary Universe. Even the Godly Geniuses were made to return back safely.</p>

  <p>These Godly Geniuses held immense power and strength within them, power that could not be fathomed. They had become top-rank True Gods within a short amount of time. Their return to the Evolutionary Universe brought prosperity to their respective clans and forces.</p>

  <p>Back in the days, Wynn was only a low-rank True God, yet he was so strong that he was almost invincible in the entire universe. The potential of the top-rank True Gods was beyond conjecture, even for the Supreme Lords.</p>

  <p>However, Nathan and the other Godly Geniuses still felt a bit regretful.</p>

  <p>Their purpose of becoming Godly Geniuses was to help Mike, Luo Zheng's father.</p>

  <p>However, Mike's opponents were powerful warriors at the Other Shore Realm. Even Mike couldn't fight against them, let alone these Godly Geniuses.</p>

  <p>After opening the gateway to the Evolutionary Universe, Luo Zheng promptly reached out his hand. In the blink of an eye, they arrived at the Breaking Cloud World.</p>

  <p>In the Breaking Cloud World, the members of the Celestial Position race had been waiting for them.</p>

  <p>The first person to welcome them was Master Feng. He personally approached them and greeted them with humility. All the Supreme Lords of the universe were present too.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's current visit to the Evolutionary Universe was different from his last.</p>

  <p>This time, he came with the intention of informing the Supreme Lords of his father's decision. Mike wanted to relieve them of their titles as the Supreme Lords for the purpose of providing them with a chance to enter the divine land. He wanted them to pursue higher levels of cultivation.</p>

  <p>The Crown of Destiny was similar to the position of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>Although the power of a Supreme Lord was far beyond that of a world lord, a Supreme Lord couldn't advance further.</p>

  <p>Back then, to face the upcoming war against Murphy, Mike had to appoint the Crowns of Destiny on these warriors. Moreover, the path to the divine land was half closed. It was impossible to enter it, unless they were led by the Jiang Clan.</p>

  <p>The only exception was Sword Chen. In contrast to the other Supreme Lords, he could sneak into the divine land at will due to his special Heavenly Destiny. The Heavenly Destiny distinguished him from others.</p>

  <p>Now that the threats of the divine land no longer existed, Mike decided he no longer needed the Supreme Lords to work for him. He allowed them to return the Crowns of Destiny.</p>

  <p>Upon receiving the news, the Supreme Lords' faces lit up with joy. They were now relieved of their duties.</p>

  <p>They were important figures in the Evolutionary Universe.</p>

  <p>However, for the Supreme Lords, higher cultivation meant pursuing their beliefs. They were always trying to reach a higher level. In the divine land, they could now do it freely.</p>

  <p>The removal of their Crowns of Destiny meant they turned into world lords again. And if they went into the divine land, they would become mere divine citizens. Many crises and challenges awaited them with patient eyes.</p>

  <p>Therefore, after Luo Zheng's announcement, half the Supreme Lords immediately handed over their Crowns of Destiny. They wanted to head to the divine land to become divine citizens.</p>

  <p>Wynn had left the Evolutionary Universe, and Mike was trying to find a way to restore his inner world. Luo Zheng listened attentively to all the demands of the Supreme Lords, and promised to fulfill them. He then asked Master Feng to record them and report them back to Mike.</p>

  <p>After those events, Luo Zheng and the others resided in the Breaking Cloud World.</p>

  <p>After three days, he took Xun to the Demon Night race's territory, before they visited the Lower World.</p>

  <p>Returning to the Central Region, he brought more people with him.</p>

  <p>Originally Nelly had doubts she would cause a lot of disputes among Luo Zheng's women. However, everyone got along. Everyone except for Margaret, who had a dominating nature. Yudie, Xun and the other ladies seemed to adjust to the environment after some rough experiences.</p>

  <p>In contrast to all the other women, Yudie was most thrilled. She could not wait to return to the Central Region, her hometown. Her eyes were beaming with joy as she anticipated all the scenarios that could unfold at her return.</p>

  <p>The Lower World and the Upper World shared the same time flow rate.</p>

  <p>However, the warriors residing in the Lower World had shorter life spans.</p>

  <p>Time flew in the Evolutionary Universe. Several hundred years equated to a lifetime for many warriors.</p>

  <p>Many third-grade and fourth-grade clans in the Cloudy City rose and fell in power. Various sects went through different changes in their ranks.</p>

  <p>However, Cloud Hall remained the number one sect.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Cloud Hall was the only eighth-grade sect in the Central Region. It stood tall as the most powerful sect, whilst the other sects followed behind.</p>

  <p>The women followed after Luo Zheng obediently, and peered down at the floating stone that held Cloud Hall. They studied it in awe with their eyes widened, taking in the entire scenery.</p>

  <p>"It's hard to imagine Luo Zheng received training in such a sect," Nelly exclaimed as she looked down at the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>To Nelly, Liusu and Aleyna, who were from the divine land, the creatures in the universe were all secondary creatures, so they were somewhat shocked by what they had seen.</p>

  <p>However, the fate of the divine land was now in the hands of a secondary creature. Just the thought of it made their stomach turn.</p>

  <p>It did not come as a surprise to Xun, Yudie, Aura, and Margaret. They had watched Luo Zheng work hard to climb up the ranks. He had struggled to get this far with his strong will. Although he had to cross many hurdles to progress towards where he stood now, it proved fruitful in the end.</p>

  <p>"Huh, what's that?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood in his tracks as if he noticed something. He stood beside the women with a stern expression. He could sense a strong killing intent coming from the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Yudie, who was now at the True God Realm, could sense it too. She said with a frown, "The Cloud Hall is an eighth-grade sect. Who in the Central Region dares to be rude to the Cloud Hall?"</p>

  <p>"Let's go have a look first," Luo Zheng smiled gently as he signaled the ladies to follow him to the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Within the walls of the Ice Palace, Lewis sat poised in his host seat. His eyes seemed to have lost the colors of the past. He emitted a haughty aura, his eyes gave out a cold expression and his face was stern.</p>

  <p>Lewis had progressed in ranks and became the mightiest one among the Soul Sea Realm warriors. He was now strong and superior. It would not take long before he was rejected by the great world. He would fly to the Upper World soon after.</p>

  <p>Lewis had visited the Upper World in the past with Luo Zheng and Patrick.</p>

  <p>However, Patrick turned out lucky and was successful in getting chosen by the Blessed Buddha Land in the Upper World. On the other hand, Tianming and Luo Zheng went ahead to the divine land because of their talents and skills.</p>

  <p>Upon returning to the Central Region, Lewis trained hard and spared no effort. He worked tirelessly and took over the position of the leader of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>It was the dream of many warriors to take charge of the eighth-grade sect, the Cloud Hall. Lewis proved himself worthy of being the leader. As a Soul Sea Realm warrior, however, he still had to fly to the Upper World in the end.</p>

  <p>Cloud Hall was a big sect. But there was no one worthy of taking control over it in the future.</p>

  <p>What was even more troublesome to Lewis was that the four divine kingdoms on the Divine Kingdom Continent would cause trouble at the critical moment of his ascension to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>The former war kings and war emperors of the four divine kingdoms had already left this great world because the path to the Upper World had been fixed.</p>

  <p>Now four warriors of the divine kingdoms, three war kings and one war emperor, gathered in the Ice Palace. They all stood before Lewis and raised their concerns about his ascension to the Upper World. A war king stepped up confidently and questioned him in an arrogant tone, "Master Lewis, although you can protect the Cloud Hall right now, haven't you ever thought about who would be able to do so after you ascend to the Upper World? By then, the eighth-grade sect will probably not live up to its name!"</p>

  <p>"You're right." Lewis removed his hand from his chin and sat up. He leaned forward towards the four men. His expression turned cold as he glared at them. "How about this? I eliminate the source of trouble before I ascend by killing all the war kings and war emperors of the four divine kingdoms?"</p>

  <p>The expressions of the four men slightly turned pale at his words.</p>

  <p>With the disappearance of the Chaotic Ocean of Stars, there had been a period of time that the Central Region and the Divine Kingdom Continent had a good relationship with each other. They lived in harmony until recent years, the warriors on the Divine Kingdom Continent were restless. The conflict between the Central Region and the Divine Kingdom Continent continued and they could not come to a conclusion to end it.</p>
