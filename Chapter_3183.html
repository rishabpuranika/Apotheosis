<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 3183 A Foolish Provocation </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Kate seemed unfazed by Milo's willfulness. She even smiled at him. "Zheng is right next door. If you want to know, you can ask him yourself."</p>

  <p>There were only a few independent houses in the Flow Sword Sect, and all of them were located in the same area. Milo's house was only a few steps away from Zheng's.</p>

  <p>Milo hesitated, and then made up his mind. "All right. I'll go and visit Zheng."</p>

  <p>The Truth of Eternal Sword Intent was essentially the soul of any swordsman? it was crucial to release and maximize one's power. The subsequent chapter was even more important. Milo was thus desperate to learn and master it.</p>

  <p>"What? I was only kidding.</p>

  <p>You're not exactly on good terms since you threatened him before.</p>

  <p>What if he does not welcome you? What if he drives you away?</p>

  <p>Not to mention, these rumors are just speculation. The fact might be that he and Feng Ge used another method to drive the giant stones,"</p>

  <p>Kate said quickly. But she was talking to his back. Milo was already walking towards the door of his house, intending to pay a visit to Zheng.</p>

  <p>Since the Seven Mountains Meeting, Zheng had felt that his life had become less peaceful, more bothersome and chaotic.</p>

  <p>The elders of the Flow Sword Sect had showered him with rewards.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Konnor and Mekhi invited him to come over almost every day.</p>

  <p>Zheng found their persistence annoying.</p>

  <p>But he had kept refusing, and finally, the invitations stopped. After two days of blessed peace and quiet, however, there was a commotion in Zheng's courtyard. He rushed out to see what was going on. A huge hammer was smashed onto the ground in the middle of the yard.</p>

  <p>"Master Hai! How did you find the hammer so quickly? You must have spent a fortune on this. Don't worry, I will pay you back," Zheng assured him, his eyes widening at the sight of the enormous hammer, its head embedded in the ground.</p>

  <p>It had been a long time since the hammer last appeared in the world. Zheng knew it must have required plenty of efforts and resources for Master Hai to find the hammer, especially since he only had the clue in his memory.</p>

  <p>"I don't need divine crystals. The one hundred and fifty words will do,"</p>

  <p>Master Hai replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>Zheng shook his head, grinning back at Master Hai. He was such a big shot.</p>

  <p>Zheng couldn't figure him out. Still, if Master Hai said he didn't care about divine crystals, then Zheng would take him at his word. Zheng immediately went to fetch a piece of rice paper, which he handed to Master Hai.</p>

  <p>He and Master Hai thanked each other, then the latter took his leave. As soon as Master Hai had gone, Zheng went to the hammer, examining it closely. He picked it up, pleased with its hefty weight, and returned inside the room.</p>

  <p>He placed the hammer down beside the Shade Phoenix Sword.</p>

  <p>Although the two weapons looked nothing alike, they had at least two similarities. Both were completely dark in color. And both were made of Shade Stones.</p>

  <p>As Zheng gazed at them, something suddenly occurred to him.</p>

  <p>He thought, 'Weapons made of Shade Stones are extremely solid. How can I absorb them?'</p>

  <p>Shade Stones and weapons made of Shade Stones were virtually indestructible. No one in the Blue Cloud City, for instance, had been able to destroy the Shade Stone. It could only be melted very slowly by the Su Clan's Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array.</p>

  <p>He wondered if this meant he would have to melt the weapons as well.</p>

  <p>Deep in thought, Zheng flicked his finger, and a flame appeared over the hammer, burning steadily on the surface of the weapon.</p>

  <p>"You must be dreaming!"</p>

  <p>No. 9527's voice came through without warning. It sounded like it was laughing.</p>

  <p>"I am just experimenting,"</p>

  <p>Zheng said, a tad defensively, and with some embarrassment, he put out the flame. It was indeed daydreaming to try to destroy the hammer using the Elementary Fire Godly Way.</p>

  <p>"Just go to the Su Clan and ask them to melt the weapons for you. I'm sure they won't refuse," No. 9527 suggested.</p>

  <p>The people of the Su Clan could definitely use the Nine Edges Weapon Refining Array to melt the weapons for Zheng. It was a reasonable idea.</p>

  <p>"But I absorbed the Shade Stone last time," Zheng said with some hesitation.</p>

  <p>After all, the reason for that fierce battle in the Blue Cloud City was that the two races were fighting to get their hands on the Shade Stone. But now it was gone, and the Su Clan was still investigating how it had been lost and where it was now.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter," said No. 9527 pragmatically. "They don't even know that you've absorbed the Shade Stone. And even if they knew, they could do nothing to you. Don't forget how important you are now."</p>

  <p>Though No. 9527 didn't explicitly praise Zheng, it clearly thought highly of his choice.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that by giving part of the Truth Enlightenment to the masters of the Oneness Sky Palace, he would be able to improve his own status very quickly.</p>

  <p>Zheng had started out as a talented new star brought by Athemar into the Oneness Sky Palace. Now he was one of its most talented disciples, a hero whom everyone expected to lead the Oneness Sky Palace forward in the future. This would be an important consideration for anyone? including the Su Clan? in their dealings with Zheng.</p>

  <p>In fact, No. 9527 didn't think highly of Zheng just because of the Truth Enlightenment. It hadn't really attached too much value to the Shade Stone at first. However, once it learned that Zheng was able to absorb the Shade Stone, it had changed tack. The Shade Stone seemed to have greater significance now, which was why No. 9527 had suggested going to the Su Clan.</p>

  <p>Zheng considered No. 9527's words as he placed the two Other Shore Treasures into his space ring. He decided to go to Gant in Dragon City before approaching the Su Clan.</p>

  <p>At that moment, a voice sounded from the courtyard. It was Trish. "Mr.</p>

  <p>Luo, someone is here to visit you," she called.</p>

  <p>"Again?"</p>

  <p>Zheng was still trying to adjust to the high volume of guests he had been receiving lately.</p>

  <p>He made his way to the gate of the house and pushed the door open.</p>

  <p>Instantly, Zheng was enveloped by a strong murderous aura, which he hadn't expected at all. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw three rays of light launched by someone nearby.</p>

  <p>Trish was a True God but she had zero tolerance for the killing intent.</p>

  <p>Under the sudden blast of the powerful killing intent, she was unable to bear the strain, and her eyes rolled up in her head as she fainted.</p>

  <p>Zheng looked to his right, towards the rays of light and saw a man standing some distance away from the gate. His face darkened. It was Marco from the Vastness Mountain, accompanied by several somber bodyguards dressed all in black.</p>

  <p>There was a time when Marco had actively sought to kill Zheng. He would have tried during the Seven Mountains Meeting, but had been stopped by Tacy. Moreover, Zheng later had gone on to defeat him in the competition, increasing Marco's resentment towards him.</p>

  <p>Upon his return to the Vastness Mountain, Marco had stewed in his own rage and bitterness until he couldn't bear it anymore. On an impulse, he had rounded up some companions and rushed over thoughtlessly to the Flow Sword Sect to challenge Zheng to yet another battle.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, we are both disciples of the Oneness Sky Palace. As your equal, I challenge you to fight me in a battle to the death! Do you accept?" Marco demanded loudly, glowering at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Zheng raised an eyebrow, looking coolly at Marco. But before he could answer, a slow and leisurely voice sounded from his left. "It's certainly permissible for a Vastness Mountain disciple to challenge a warrior of the Flow Sword Sect. But it's very bad manners not to follow the proper etiquette for such a challenge."</p>

  <p>Both Zheng and Marco turned to see who had spoken. It was Milo.</p>

  <p>Marco's face changed. "Milo, walk away now. This has nothing to do with you," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>"Zheng and I are both disciples of the Flow Sword Sect. We share with each other any honor or disgrace that befalls the sect. How can you say that this is none of my business? If you want the honor of fighting Zheng, you must win against me first," Milo said calmly.</p>

  <p>He lightly pinched his fingers in the air. A lovely butterfly, glimmering with its own gentle light, appeared in the air behind his head.</p>

  <p>The moment he saw the butterfly, Marco's pupils dilated, and he took an involuntary step backwards. He recognized the tiny, beautiful creature as a fearsome and deadly threat.</p>

  <p>Marco wore the expression of someone who had a sword pressed to his neck, not knowing if his attacker would slice his throat or pull away.</p>

  <p>"Leave now. I don't want to see you again in the Flow Sword Sect," Milo told him. He wore a look of utmost contempt. He did not respect Marco at all, regardless of his status as the son of the head of the Vastness Mountain.</p>

  <p>"What? You would dare to kill me?"</p>

  <p>Marco spluttered. Thinking of the strange killing methods of the Flow Sword Sect disciples, he broke out in a cold sweat. But he held his ground and shook his head at Milo. Marco would not leave. He still had his position as the son of the Vastness Mountain's head to protect him? or so he thought.</p>

  <p>There was a glint of light as a weapon swung rapidly towards Marco.</p>

  <p>Marco's mouth fell open as blood spurted out from a wound in his chest.</p>

  <p>Milo had stabbed him through the heart without a moment's hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Young Master Marco!"</p>

  <p>"Young Master Marco!"</p>

  <p>"Stop the bleeding first!"</p>

  <p>The bodyguards, a second too late, swarmed around Marco and tried to staunch the blood flowing from his chest. They were absolutely stunned.</p>

  <p>Like their young master, they had believed that Milo wouldn't dare to actually kill Marco.</p>
