  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng finished drawing his first meditation divine texture, he did not stop.</p>

  <p>The reason why he bought so many materials was to practice his skills of drawing divine textures. The materials were enough for him to make ten divine textures.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng did not want to waste these materials so he started to make his next one.</p>

  <p>Even a runic expert could not keep making runes without any rest as the strength of his soul was consumed during the process of making runes.</p>

  <p>When one's soul strength was not enough, one would feel tired and sleepy, and once the exhaustion hit, it would be difficult to concentrate.</p>

  <p>Having strong soul strength, Luo Zheng now could continuously make eight divine textures. Now he managed to finish the eighth one with great difficulty and before he could start the next divine texture, he felt uncomfortable all of a sudden. His head felt terrible as if it was about to explode. He could not focus his attention anymore. Out of sleepiness, he accidentally stroked a bad stroke with his brush pen, and the drawing wasn't perfectly completed.</p>

  <p>One should be careful when he made runes. With one tiny mistake, the whole rune could be ruined.</p>

  <p>"This is your first time making runes and you cannot consume too much of your soul strength. It will be a big loss if you use up your soul strength and damage your soul," the cyan dragon said. At his words, Luo Zheng felt a comfortable freshness in his head. Soon he felt much better.</p>

  <p>Because the cyan dragon had swallowed the flood dragon spirit and blood, he became more active recently and had more strength to help Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>When he heard the dragon's warning, Zheng's heart was tightened. He realized that it was really a haste for him to practice drawing the divine texture for such a long time. Nothing could be accomplished on the first try. Luo Zheng must stop now before it was too late.</p>

  <p>After that, Luo Zheng focused on his cultivation. Besides learning the skills of making the divine texture, he also had to face the disciples of the Elite House as usual.</p>

  <p>It became almost like a mandatory course for Luo Zheng. Every morning, Zheng's body was controlled by Morphens. He had to enter the gray building, where he battled against the disciples from the Elite House.</p>

  <p>In order to defeat the disciples from the Elite House, Luo Zheng had to use every skill he had learned. At first, Luo Zheng could handle this by his powerful body and the strength of the dragon scales inside his body. But as the mornings passed, there would be more and more disciples who would challenge Luo Zheng, and many would assess him for his weaknesses; they would be better and better at knowing how to defeat him. Luo Zheng felt much more pressured. There was an instance where Luo Zheng had to use his unique skill of Spiritual Thorn, and even once he had to call out his sword spirit, Lily, to help him fight.</p>

  <p>The disciples of the Elite House were also surprised. In their eyes, Luo Zheng was so tenacious that it was really a tough thing to defeat him. Each disciple who fought against Luo Zheng was stronger than the previous one, but Luo Zheng seemed always to have special skills to defeat them.</p>

  <p>The last one to fight against Luo Zheng that day was at grade six of the Illuminating Soul Realm. Although this disciple was not the strongest of all the disciples of his level, he was strong enough to defeat Luo Zheng as there was a very large gap between the level six of the Illuminating Soul Realm and the level five, the level of the precious disciple that Luo Zheng defeated. However, this disciple at the sixth level was still defeated by Luo Zheng in the end.</p>

  <p>After the three fights that day, Luo Zheng finished and went away from the building. He wanted to go to the market of the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>He had spent lots of cubic crystals buying the materials for making the divine textures. Now he wanted to know whether or not the divine textures he made could be sold in the market.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was unsure, and on his way to the market, he was riddled with uncertainty. After all, the meditation divine texture was just his first practice. He planned to go to the shop of the old man from the World Commercial Alliance. Since he had done a great favor to the old man the day before, he figured that the old man wouldn't turn him away even if his divine textures couldn't be sold.</p>

  <p>Tia, in the ice palace, felt dissatisfied with Luo Zheng. She was looking at Luo Zheng through the Picture Slab with her eyebrows knitted in confusion.</p>

  <p>"Why does he want to learn the skill of making runes? He doesn't cultivate himself for enough time. Why does he waste his time and energy?" Tia wondered aloud. Tia did not feel content. The reason why she helped Luo Zheng was that she had a plan in her head. But Zheng's cultivation was too low now and she could not carry her plan out. That was why she asked Luo Zheng to play against the disciples from the Elite House. She wanted Luo Zheng to improve as much as possible in the shortest possible time.</p>

  <p>In her eyes, Luo Zheng didn't yet have enough time to cultivate himself. And now that she saw Luo Zheng was spending a lot of time and energy on drawing the divine texture, she thought that he was wasting his time.</p>

  <p>In Tia's eyes, runes were too profound for Luo Zheng to learn in a short time.</p>

  <p>Many runic experts and magic array masters could only have great achievements after they spent a lot of time and energy learning it. Luo Zheng hadn't learned runes before and now he wanted to learn runes. It was impossible for him to succeed in such a short time, and Tia could not wait that long.</p>

  <p>Morphens, who was standing near her and heard what she said, laughed.</p>

  <p>"Lady, it is normal for a youngster to try something new. If he knows how difficult it is to learn runes, he will give it up naturally. Don't worry about it."</p>

  <p>"No," Tia said, raising her finely plucked eyebrows. "I cannot wait. Luo Zheng must enter the Illuminating Soul Realm. I don't think he has time to learn about the skills of making runes. He must stop it now."</p>

  <p>At her words, Morphens looked at her and internally gave a sigh. 'She is actually worried about herself. She has reached the last stage of her cultivation method, the Sutra of Empyrean Goddess. She should concentrate on her own cultivation. Even though Luo Zheng has good talents, he is too young.'</p>

  <p>But Morphens dared not speak out his thoughts. Everyone knew that Tia, the head of the Cloud Hall, was a person of strong mind and strong character. She did not change her mind easily.</p>
