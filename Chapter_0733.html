<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>All humans had a soft spot.</p>

  <p>Zheng's weakness was his younger sister, whom he tried to protect even at the cost of his life.</p>

  <p>Zheng's dream was to reach the peak of martial arts to explore the secrets of this world. His warrior spirit was so firm that no one could affect it adversely.</p>

  <p>However, Eden was different.</p>

  <p>His experience differed significantly from Zheng's experience. Zheng had lived a tough life and been mistreated. He persisted in his pursuit of martial arts for it was the only way to change his life.</p>

  <p>Eden's father was Eddie, who ranked first in the Central Region. As his only child, Eden was blessed with great talent, insights, and resources.</p>

  <p>Even Brent hadn't gotten as many resources as Eden did. Eddie had piled all his resources onto Eden, while Brent had access to limited resources.</p>

  <p>Ethereal Spirit Sect also had to provide resources to its other talented disciples other than Brent.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that Eden would surely become the master of a sixth-grade sacred place or a divine kingdom in the near future with regard to his talent and the resources his father had provided him with.</p>

  <p>That was why Eden, a cultivator at the Internal Elixir Realm, had the guts to propose to Yudie!</p>

  <p>He was confident that he would be among the top martial artists.</p>

  <p>Having grown up in that environment, Eden had developed a strong level of self-confidence. In his eyes, the elites of the younger generation in the Central Region were nothing but losers. He looked down on them.</p>

  <p>He was not afraid of any challenges. Since he was always confident, Eden had no trouble achieving great things in the martial arts field. Besides, no one among the young-generation cultivators in the Central Region could defeat him. If it weren't for Zheng, he would be the strongest cultivator in the near future.</p>

  <p>However, people like him had a fatal weakness— defeat or failure would come as a big blow.</p>

  <p>He was an excellent cultivator. The harder Eden cultivated, the more outstanding he became. But all his hard work was on the premise that he was superior to others. However, once a fellow appeared and defeated Eden, he would feel frustrated and doubt his capabilities and whether his efforts were in vain.</p>

  <p>Zheng was that guy.</p>

  <p>In terms of laws, Zheng had surpassed Eden. As for treasures, Zheng had two sacred weapons, which were better than Eden's weapons. Compared to his cultivation base, Zheng was at a lower level than Eden, and this was an insult to him. However, Zheng was more talented than Eden. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to defeat Eden.</p>

  <p>At this point, Eden was a dispirited mess. He derided himself for being conceited and arrogant. And his determination in martial arts had been shattered.</p>

  <p>Eddie, who had been standing on the platform, took a step forward and reached the field.</p>

  <p>Although Eddie was bulky, he was not tall. As he stepped forward, he looked determined as if nothing could strike him down.</p>

  <p>"Thu-ud! Thu-ud!"</p>

  <p>Eddie stepped onto the stage unhurriedly, fixing his resolute, cold eyes on Zheng.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Yudie walked onto the stage. With the icy fog around her flickering, she landed on the field and stood in front of Zheng.</p>

  <p>In terms of her current strength, she had difficulty protecting Zheng from Eddie. Despite that, she had chosen to come to her disciple's aid.</p>

  <p>At the same time, the three leaders of the World Commercial Alliance joined them. The three fat men had different expressions on their faces, but there was a serious look in their eyes as if they were about to fight with a fierce enemy.</p>

  <p>No one stood a chance to get the better of Eddie, who was the strongest man in the Central Region in single combat.</p>

  <p>The three fatties of the World Commercial Alliance could fight off Eddie, but they would pay a heavy price.</p>

  <p>In fact, the three men had no intention of getting involved in this. After all, Eddie was planning to confront Zheng, who was Cloud Hall's disciple. This matter, hence, did not involve the three fat men from the World Commercial Alliance. But they had hosted this Martial Arts Contest, and according to the rules, Zheng would not be held responsible even if he had taken Eden's life. However, all Zheng had done was destroy Eden's warrior spirit.</p>

  <p>"Eddie, you're not going to make a move on the lad, are you?" Dillon asked cheekily. His subtle message was that Eddie would be taunted if he fought with a young cultivator, who was only at the Illuminating Soul Realm.</p>

  <p>Eddie usually wouldn't attack a young cultivator in front of hundreds of thousands of cultivators for it would make him the laughingstock of Oracle City. However, Zheng had destroyed Eden's warrior spirit. All the old strong cultivators in the Central Region knew that Eddie had high expectations of his son.</p>

  <p>An eerie, defiant smile appeared on Eddie's face. He snorted at Zheng who was standing behind Yudie, "You are a bold fellow!"</p>

  <p>Eddie's eyes widened as an overwhelming aura extended toward Zheng.</p>

  <p>Yudie, who was standing in front of Zheng, felt the pressure and knitted her eyebrows. Instantly, she intertwined her fingers intending to display a secret technique to withstand the pressure Eddie had released. Yudie hadn't completely recovered yet, and even if she had fully restored her formal cultivation, she would still not match Eddie. But if she had mastered the Sutra of the Empyrean Goddess and made a breakthrough in the Virtual Tribulation Realm, she would stand a chance to beat Eddie. Hence, she was under higher pressure when facing a powerful opponent like Eddie.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Zheng grabbed her hand and pulled her behind him. Eyes sparkling with resolve, he whispered to Yudie, "I don't like being protected by women."</p>

  <p>He never wanted to see a woman risking her life to protect him.</p>

  <p>However, in his lifetime, many women had come to his rescue, such as Nina, Aura, and Yolande.</p>

  <p>Back then, Zheng was a weak cultivator, and he had to accept their help. But now he didn't want to see Yudie get in trouble because of him.</p>

  <p>Yudie had been so focused on activating her secret skill that she didn't expect Zheng to react that way. By the time she realized what was going on, she was behind Zheng, and her right hand was still in his.</p>

  <p>'He is holding my hand in front of so many people...' Yudie thought to herself.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Yudie had completely forgotten that they were in grave danger. At the thought that Zheng had taken her hand, she began to blush and her heart raced.</p>

  <p>The next second, she returned to her senses and realized that Zheng had to bear the enormous pressure from Eddie.</p>

  <p>'Although Zheng could beat a cultivator at the Internal Elixir Realm, he can't withstand the power Eddie has activated. After all, the latter is stronger than the cultivators of the Virtual Tribulation Realm.' At this thought, Yudie became extremely worried about Zheng's safety. "Be careful!" she reminded him.</p>

  <p>The pressure Eddie had activated was amazingly powerful. If a senior cultivator of the Virtual Tribulation Realm were in Zheng's place, his soul would get damaged, while a cultivator at the Internal Elixir Realm would be killed.</p>

  <p>The three fat men looked at each other and furrowed their eyebrows. 'Eddie didn't display a skill, but he is using his momentum to suppress Zheng. The lad is in a lot of trouble now. Perhaps he will lose his life, ' they brooded.</p>

  <p>"Is he pretending to be a hero? He even stands in front of Yudie! Does he really think that he is more powerful than a cultivator at the Virtual Tribulation Realm?" one man quizzed.</p>

  <p>"You're upset because he is holding Yudie's hand, aren't you?" another responded with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Although he has exceptional talent, Zheng is going to die. His soul will be crushed, and then he will live like the walking dead. He can't survive for three days without his soul."</p>

  <p>Many of the cultivators present had no idea what Zheng was thinking. 'If he hid behind Yudie, he would only get injured. He is lucky to be such an awesome genius. As long as he is alive, everything is possible. He could have improved his strength and taken his revenge one day, ' the crowd thought.</p>

  <p>Most of the cultivators knew how to endure, and they guessed that Zheng knew it as well. That was why they were confused by his decision.</p>
