  <p>
</p>

  <p>Everyone's eyes were focused on the die, their faces puzzled.</p>

  <p>It was strange that a six-sided die had appeared in this celestial tomb.</p>

  <p>The die had spun slowly as it appeared, but it gradually slowed down. It finally came to a standstill, floating in the air and not moving one bit.</p>

  <p>As everyone looked on in puzzlement, a ray of light shot out from the die. It was like a pointer, moving on the level curve and sweeping past everyone.</p>

  <p>It passed by the people of the Bloodwood Cliff, the Ethereal Spirit Sect, Luo Luo Zheng, Ning Yudie, and everyone else.</p>

  <p>The light rotated faster and faster, and when it reached a certain speed, it slowed down and finally stopped at the platform where an elder of the Black Mountain Sect stood.</p>

  <p>The elder became nervous, clueless about what was going on.</p>

  <p>"W-what is this?" he asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>No one could give him an answer. It was the first time that anyone who was present there had seen such a thing.</p>

  <p>As time passed, the light that had shot out of the die began to jump and its color began to change. It slowly turned from a bright yellow to red, and the two colors flickered alternately.</p>

  <p>The elder of the Black Mountain Sect began to panic at the change in the light beam. He looked at Raven, the sect head, and shouted in panic, "Sir, save me!"</p>

  <p>Raven was not far from the elder. The problem was that the emerald enchanted barrier surrounding the platform could not be broken. So Raven couldn't help him even if he wanted to.</p>

  <p>When the beam of light finally turned completely red, it shone bright, focusing on the body of the Black Mountain Sect elder. A horrifying amount of powerful energy erupted from the beam of light, instantly shattering the elder into pieces.</p>

  <p>The shock registered on everyone's face at this.</p>

  <p>Raven was wearing a mask, so it was impossible to see his expression. But he definitely had to be as stunned as everyone else.</p>

  <p>The energy contained within the beam of light was something that no one could resist and was extremely terrifying.</p>

  <p>Not to mention that the man who had just died was an elder of the Virtual Tribulation Realm. Even a Life and Death Realm expert wouldn't be able to block this beam of light.</p>

  <p>What the hell was this? It seemed that whoever the beam of light was directed at had to die.</p>

  <p>No one could answer this question. After the beam of light had instantly killed the Black Mountain Sect elder, it began to slowly spin again.</p>

  <p>Everyone prayed nervously, 'Don't let the light shine on me!'</p>

  <p>The beam of light started to slow down, sliding towards the Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>People from the other sects let out a sigh of relief as they saw this, assured that it wouldn't be them.</p>

  <p>However, it was a different story for Cloud Hall.</p>

  <p>Emanuel was ashen-faced as he looked at the beam of light that was slowly moving towards him. Only when the beam of light slowly flew past him did he heave a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>The beam of light then shot towards Morphens. He frowned as he stared at the beam that symbolized death, contemplating ways to deal with it.</p>

  <p>However, the beam of light did not stop at Morphens either. In the end, it swept past Imogen and slowly turned towards Ning Yudie.</p>

  <p>"Tia," Luo Luo Zheng said, his heart dropping.</p>

  <p>Just when everyone had begun to think that the beam of light was aimed at Tia, it shifted a little and landed on Luo Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Eddie smiled faintly, yet contemptuously. 'This little brat has been always lucky. It looks like his luck is about to run out today. Even a Virtual Tribulation Realm warrior couldn't withstand this beam of light. So this brat is doomed.'</p>

  <p>"Luo Luo Zheng!" Ning Yudie was very nervous.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's brow creased.</p>

  <p>When this beam of light turned red in a few seconds, it would kill him.</p>

  <p>There was a frenzy at the realization that not a single person was able to retain their composure.</p>

  <p>But Luo Luo Zheng looked abnormally calm.</p>

  <p>He still had a bit of support on his body, so he should be able to resist the red light. He was still carrying the protective talisman that the leader of the Dragon Abyss Palace had given him, which was also from the Upper World and was supposed to be able to help him resist the red light.</p>

  <p>Impatience was useless at this point. The most important thing was to think.</p>

  <p>No matter what the purpose of the Mist Celestial Tomb's design was, it should not have left behind such a death trap. As the beam revolved around, more and more people would die. Could it be that this beam of light was going to kill everyone here?</p>

  <p>'Calm down, calm down, ' Luo Luo Zheng kept telling himself.</p>

  <p>The giant die in the middle!</p>

  <p>It definitely had something to do with that die. The question was, how should he solve this mystery?</p>

  <p>Die...</p>

  <p>The problem must have been the die.</p>

  <p>Everyone had to face this one, though.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, the red light appeared again. The yellow and red light continued to appear alternately. Once the light turned completely red, it would kill Luo Luo Zheng in an instant.</p>

  <p>Some people like Eddie, who harbored nothing but enmity for Luo Luo Zheng, sneered.</p>

  <p>But most people were worried. Even if Luo Luo Zheng died, what would happen next?</p>

  <p>They also had to face the beam of light. How could they escape death?</p>

  <p>The red light jumped faster and faster. Luo Zheng's eyes fluttered and his life vitality surged. He punched in the air, and the shadow of his fist actually shot towards the die.</p>

  <p>Bam!</p>

  <p>The strange thing was that the emerald enchanted barrier in front of Luo Luo Zheng had not blocked his attack. The shadow of his fist went straight through.</p>

  <p>The die jumped up after Luo Zheng's punch, rolled a few times, and finally stopped with a number.</p>

  <p>"Two dots."</p>

  <p>The beam of light shining on Luo Luo Zheng gradually turned yellow.</p>

  <p>"Is everything alright?" This scene brought joy to everyone's hearts.</p>

  <p>Ning Yudie exhaled deeply. Luo Luo Zheng was indeed unusually lucky.</p>

  <p>"It turned out that the trick was to hit that giant die in the middle, but I don't know why."</p>

  <p>"That elder from Black Mountain Sect has died pointlessly."</p>

  <p>"It was his own fault. He was too stupid to know that he should attack the die in the middle!"</p>

  <p>Everyone was discussing these events among themselves. Although Luo Luo Zheng had survived, they still could not understand what exactly the purpose of the design for the Mist Celestial Tomb was.</p>

  <p>Right after the die showed the two dots, the emerald enchanted barrier before Luo Luo Zheng disappeared and two discs appeared in front of him.</p>

  <p>The answer dawned on Luo Luo Zheng as he looked at the two discs. "So that's how it is. Attacking the die in front of us will allow us to move forward based on the dots we have."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't hesitate. He stepped off the platform, onto one disc, and took two steps forward.</p>

  <p>He understood at this moment, and watching him step forward, everyone else immediately understood too. Now that they had an understanding and a plan, they became much calmer. They just had to attack that die and get a number. They could then take a number of steps according to the die to walk forward.</p>

  <p>They were relieved and when the beam of light began to spin again, they weren't as nervous anymore.</p>

  <p>After Luo Luo Zheng had taken two steps forward, the beam of light began to spin again. It spun continuously and finally landed on Brent, a disciple of the Ethereal Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>Brent smiled and punched the die, which rolled a few times in the air and finally revealed a number, six.</p>

  <p>Soon after, six discs appeared in front of Brent. As he stepped forward, he smiled at Luo Luo Zheng and teased, "It looks like I'm luckier than you."</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng laughed lightly, not minding it at all.</p>

  <p>Soon, the beam of light rotated for the fourth time, and it landed on an elder of the Mysterious Luna Hall.</p>

  <p>The elder smirked and also threw a punch. As a Virtual Tribulation Realm martial artist, he used 80% of his strength in this punch, sending the die flying high into the air. It fell down heavily, revealing a number, three.</p>

  <p>"Three, not bad!" The elder from Mysterious Luna Hall took three steps forward without hesitation.</p>

  <p>However, just as he stepped onto the third disk, the disk suddenly changed color from translucent to a fiery red.</p>

  <p>"Blazing Thunder Prison!" a faint voice said.</p>

  <p>Pop!</p>

  <p>A ball of intense flames suddenly exploded around the elder, and at the same time, purple lightning bolts descended from the sky, one after the other, with cracking sounds.</p>

  <p>The bolts of lightning were like mad snakes as they burned the elder down.</p>

  <p>After a long time, the flames and lightning finally disappeared. There was only charred coal left on the third disk.</p>

  <p>Everyone was horrified all over again.</p>
