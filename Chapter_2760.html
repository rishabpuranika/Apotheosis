  <p>
</p>

  <p>Large chunks of flesh fell from the sky, landing in the black water.</p>

  <p>Neither of the two Demi-holy Beings had a chance of escaping. Both their bodies and souls had already been killed.</p>

  <p>Samuel's hands maintained their previous posture as he stood above the black, flowing water, staring at Luo Zheng with an indifferent glare.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Luo Zheng's expression became rather gloomy all of a sudden.</p>

  <p>Of course, he was well aware that Samuel wasn't weak. That said, the method used was far beyond any of his expectations.</p>

  <p>Samuel had simply and casually released his strength, instantly killing two top-level Demi-holy Beings. It was absolutely incredible.</p>

  <p>It was safe to say that he just might be as powerful as Nicholas.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't have revealed my identity." Samuel stared at Luo Zheng calmly as a trace of killing intent began to form in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Nicholas is my enemy, too. I'll eventually kill him sooner or later. You shouldn't have sacrificed your daughters." Luo Zheng stared back at Samuel angrily. His aura was by no means inferior to Samuel's.</p>

  <p>Both of them had the same goal, to say the least.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, on his behalf, wasn't going to stoop to his level and wouldn't cross the line. There was no way in hell he was going to achieve his goal by sacrificing Liusu and Aleyna.</p>

  <p>On the contrary however, Samuel resorted to every other possibly conceivable means.</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to say I should place my hope in you?" The corners of Samuel's lips curled into a smirk and a look of mockery was quick to appear on his face.</p>

  <p>Samuel appreciated Luo Zheng, but he was clear on the fact that expecting Luo Zheng to rise and kill Nicholas was nothing more than a daydream.</p>

  <p>He himself had lived long enough to fulfill two lives. Thus, he knew that he couldn't trust anyone, at any time.</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, he stretched out his hand and grabbed at the air abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Divine weapon!"</p>

  <p>The space was immediately torn open by Samuel and the wide crack quickly began to condense itself, turning into a pitch black spear!</p>

  <p>Samuel grabbed the black spear in his hand, pointed its tip at Luo Zheng and said,</p>

  <p>"Everything I've lost will be paid back by Nicholas, multiplied by ten or even a hundred times. As for you, I'd better kill you first. In the future, whether I can bring you back to life or not will depend solely on my mood."</p>

  <p>As soon as he took notice of the black spear, Luo Zheng's expression changed at once.</p>

  <p>Here, in the Abyss Demon Region, the Space Law was prohibited in every way, shape and form. Apart from the space channels built by the fiends, even a Holy Being was completely incapable of using the Grand Teleportation technique.</p>

  <p>Despite such, Luo Zheng clearly sensed an extremely strong Space Law power emitting itself from Samuel's black spear.</p>

  <p>"Your spear has developed beyond the Abyss Demon Region's restrictions,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stated flatly, as he furrowed his brow.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! Like I've said before, you know absolutely nothing! Why would you even get involved in this matter?"</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Samuel launched his arm upward, his spear slicing through the air.</p>

  <p>As he performed this action, a black light also shot out from around the spear's tip.</p>

  <p>The black light gradually spread out in a narrow fan shape, zooming past Luo Zheng's ear and extending hundreds of thousands of feet away.</p>

  <p>When the fan-shaped space had extended far enough, both sides shut together instantly, like a huge pair of scissors. The space transformed into a thin black line right before their eyes.</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng had been standing within the fan-shaped space, his head would have been sliced straight off.</p>

  <p>"The Spear of Supreme Harmony should be at the top, even among the Abyss Demon Region's faith weapons," Samuel said as he looked at Luo Zheng's expression with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>For a long time, Nicholas had outshone him greatly, and in many different ways. The younger generation of the Floating Islands' powerful clans simply didn't take him seriously anymore.</p>

  <p>Now, he was trying his very best to get his dignity back, especially in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Faith weapon...</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes flashed as these words met his ears.</p>

  <p>Seeing the black spear had disobeyed the Abyss Demon Region's rules, Luo Zheng had come up with his own hypothesis, but in his heart, he didn't expect it to be true.</p>

  <p>"In my previous life, I obtained this faith weapon in the Abyss Demon Region, and I equally successfully escaped from this place. In other words, it's safe to say that I really have great luck." A crazy look flashed on Samuel's face, just long enough for Luo Zheng to notice it. "I need to control much more than just the Abyss Demon Region."</p>

  <p>As he finished his sentence, he disappeared in the blink of an eye, the Spear of Supreme Harmony still in his hand.</p>

  <p>"The Grand Teleportation!"</p>

  <p>Secretly, Luo Zheng was feeling very shocked. No one else could use the Grand Teleportation, but Samuel, on the other hand, was using it with ease. This was all too much for Luo Zheng to accept at once!</p>

  <p>Almost subconsciously, he sank deeply, in a sharp, straight line.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>In the open void, the Spear of Supreme Harmony suddenly thrust forward, sweeping past Luo Zheng's head and missing him by only a couple inches.</p>

  <p>"I must say, I'm impressed by your quick response. Can you really avoid it every time, though?"</p>

  <p>As soon as Samuel stepped out of the void, he stepped immediately into it again.</p>

  <p>Before he could fully enter the void, the spear attempted to stab Luo Zheng in the face, catching him off guard by coming from another direction.</p>

  <p>Such a method was actually rather mysterious.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>"The Eight Smoky Melodies!"</p>

  <p>Unexpectedly, Luo Zheng's body became unusually flexible, like a malleable piece of paper, floating against the Spear of Supreme Harmony.</p>

  <p>"What an interesting bodily movement skill. I've never seen anything like it before!"</p>

  <p>Jayden could easily figure out a way to defeat Luo Zheng's bodily movement skill, not to mention Samuel.</p>

  <p>As he turned his back to Luo Zheng, he tried stabbing him several times in a row once again. Each stab was futile, however.</p>

  <p>Each stab did nothing more than break through the void and appear around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>After twelve repetitive stabs, the spear's tip created several vertical and horizontal space cracks around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>It only took a split second for these space cracks to form a square space cage, completely trapping Luo Zheng inside.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha! I wonder how you'll escape this time, huh?" Samuel laughed mockingly.</p>

  <p>Trapped inside the cage's four walls, Luo Zheng didn't have any space to dodge anymore.</p>

  <p>That said, it didn't mean he could do nothing.</p>

  <p>In his hands, Samuel held the Spear of Supreme Harmony, and Luo Zheng had the jade seal, which could erase time.</p>

  <p>Despite its power, the jade seal wasn't enough to help Luo Zheng escape from the cage at this point in time.</p>

  <p>In fact, the jade seal could only erase a short period of time. If Samuel truly wanted to kill Luo Zheng, then he'd have to launch a complete saturation attack.</p>

  <p>If he attacked Luo Zheng without stopping in a short period of time, he'd successfully take Luo Zheng's life. In such a case, it would be impossible for Luo Zheng to turn the tables, even if he did succeed in erasing time.</p>

  <p>In spite of his unfortunate position, Luo Zheng still had the Wind Cloud Escape for use, one of the Latent Theurgies.</p>

  <p>Although the Space Law was prohibited in the Abyss Demon Region, the Wind Cloud Escape remained an extraordinary token. Luo Zheng genuinely believed that this technique would help him escape such a horrid place.</p>

  <p>"But... Why isn't the Wind Cloud Escape triggered?" Luo Zheng mumbled, questioning himself.</p>

  <p>As soon as Samuel thrust his spear out into the void, it headed directly for Luo Zheng in a dangerously straight line.</p>

  <p>Phew!</p>

  <p>Out of the blue, the once calm black water suddenly began to move, larger and larger waves crashing into each other.</p>

  <p>A sharp, thin line broke the black water's silence and slashed upward.</p>

  <p>Crack...</p>

  <p>Click!</p>

  <p>Without the slightest deviation, the thin line broke the space cage that was binding Luo Zheng immediately, and then landed directly on the Spear of Supreme Harmony.</p>

  <p>The thin line was so incredibly powerful that for a few moments, Samuel felt unable to hold the spear in his own two hands.</p>

  <p>"The Emotion Closing Divine Dao?" Luo Zheng questioned.</p>

  <p>For a while, he was utterly stunned. He was very familiar with the Emotion Closing Divine Dao's internal momentum. He couldn't believe his own two eyes.</p>

  <p>From within the line, Luo Zheng could feel the internal momentum hidden inside.</p>

  <p>This was true, even if his eyes were closed.</p>

  <p>What was more, the internal momentum was simply perfect. There was no other way to describe it. Obviously, it had come from a very advanced stage.</p>

  <p>Just like the black eyes' owner was shocked when he saw Luo Zheng use the Emotion Closing Divine Dao, Luo Zheng was also extremely shocked right now.</p>

  <p>As this emotion washed over him, someone came to his mind.</p>

  <p>Sword Chen practiced the Gods-intimidating Strike as well as the Emotion Closing Divine Dao. What was more, he had travelled to the Abyss Demon Region, but no one knew whether he was dead or alive.</p>
