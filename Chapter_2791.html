  <p>
</p>

  <p>In theory, a Holy Being was also a True God. But their strength, insights and reactions were far better than those of Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods.</p>

  <p>The alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands fought along the way.</p>

  <p>During the fight, they had lost many Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods, but none of the Holy Beings died.</p>

  <p>Thus, the level of difficulty to kill a Holy Being could be imagined.</p>

  <p>The woman had mentioned that to quell the anger of the True Demon Body, at least three Holy Beings were needed to be sacrificed. The thought gradually made Zheng wonder what kind of dangerous situation would those Holy Beings face.</p>

  <p>"It's not easy to kill a Holy Being. Are you sure of what you said?" Zheng asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>He might need to take advantage of the current situation to gather the secrets of this world of ice and snow. The more he would know about this world, the more chances there were for his survival. In the end, there might be a falling out between him and the woman at any point in time!</p>

  <p>The woman's eyelashes flattered. She stared at Zheng and spoke, "Of course I knew what I was saying. I'm so familiar with this place, and my judgments are always close to the fact. I remember that in my eight thousand and five hundredth attempt, I was able to deal with the True Demon Body's anger using Sword Chen's duplicate."</p>

  <p>The alliance of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands knew nothing about this world. As a result, they would pay a heavy price this time.</p>

  <p>Her valuable experience was based on her repeated failures...</p>

  <p>"Howl!"</p>

  <p>Roars once again resounded from the distance.</p>

  <p>Another wave of extremely cold energy spread out. The resounding roars were even louder this time as they got closer.</p>

  <p>"Looks like they are heading in this direction. The Holy Beings are very smart. They knew that they had to retreat when they couldn't defeat their enemy," the woman spoke flatly after hearing the roaring sound.</p>

  <p>She shifted her gaze and looked at the replica of a Holy Being.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being clone perceived the gaze in understanding and nodded. He knelt down on one knee, and his one hand patted the ground gently!</p>

  <p>"Boom!"</p>

  <p>An extremely powerful energy shot into the ground as it gave an explosion underneath.</p>

  <p>This Holy Being clone was skillful at controlling energy. The explosion he made was violent under the ground, but the effect was unseen on the surface. The ground had only trembled slightly!</p>

  <p>"Okay, I'm done," the Holy Being clone informed after making the move.</p>

  <p>A small hole had appeared in front of him. The hole was only wide enough for one person to pass through.</p>

  <p>"You all get in, and I'll guard the rear!" the woman then said to Zheng and Sword Chen.</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded. Without hesitation, he took the lead in stepping into the small hole, his body falling down vertically.</p>

  <p>It took more than a hundred feet before he finally landed on the ground. As his feet stepped on the ground, the area had turned bright in an instant.</p>

  <p>The huge space underground he fell into was the space created by the explosion the Holy Being clone made. It was safe to say that more than a thousand people could fit into it.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Zheng got in without any danger, Sword Chen and the replicas of the other Holy Beings followed one after the other.</p>

  <p>As everyone safely got in, the woman followed last but she did not descend directly. She still clung to the entrance of the small hole and looked up into the distance.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>A remarkable circle of white cold air that floated far away was quickly dispersed.</p>

  <p>Looking over, she had a faint smile on her lips. She gestured a gentle pat on the snow with her fingers and the surrounding snow gathered into a lump.</p>

  <p>She then proceeded to let go of the entrance and land in the space created underground. The small hole then completely closed and disappeared.</p>

  <p>She did everything in smooth order which made the group who were running over missed it in a beat.</p>

  <p>Over a hundred people were dashing over on the surface of the snow-covered plain. They were the members of the alliance of powerful clans on the Floating Islands!</p>

  <p>"Damn it! What the hell is that? When my energy gets close to it, it disappears directly?" a Demi-holy Being cursed with an unbelievable look on his face.</p>

  <p>As soon as he finished speaking...</p>

  <p>He suddenly felt a chill creep through his spine.</p>

  <p>His face darkened and he shockingly roared, "Heavenly Fire Prison!"</p>

  <p>"Sizzle..."</p>

  <p>A world of flames instantly spread out and shrouded him.</p>

  <p>The Heavenly Fire Prison was this Demi-holy Being's unique skill and was also a peak level theurgy beyond the Elementary Fire Godly Way. He had relied on this theurgy to become a Demi-holy Being!</p>

  <p>In terms of the understanding of Elementary Fire Godly Way, he was almost at par with Clark!</p>

  <p>The blazing evil fire roared and burned in the Heavenly Fire Prison.</p>

  <p>In the prison, there were countless creatures in the form of fire. If any of the prisoners was released, it could burn the whole world to ashes.</p>

  <p>When the Demi-holy Being was enveloped by the fire prison, the chill inside his body was immediately dispelled.</p>

  <p>But the Demi-holy Being was still upset.</p>

  <p>Outside the Heavenly Fire Prison, a circle of cold air had enveloped the prison. The white mist contracted and quickly broke into the fire prison!</p>

  <p>The big flames in the fire prison quickly quenched when they encountered the cold air. Countless fire creatures shouted and roared in the fire prison, as if the cold air was the most deadly poison and they would die when they touched it!</p>

  <p>None of them could escape the cold air.</p>

  <p>The range of the fire prison continued to shrink without any hint of stopping. It eventually made the hope in the Demi-holy Being's heart be shattered.</p>

  <p>When the cold air hit him, he felt that the blood in his body was frozen and even the internal momentum inside him had lost its vitality and dissipated quickly.</p>

  <p>"Phew!"</p>

  <p>His effort to fight it off was completely naught, making him completely frozen. He became an iceman and fell down in an instant from the air!</p>

  <p>"Crack!"</p>

  <p>Just as his frozen body fell into the snow, a big foot stomped heavily on him.</p>

  <p>As the foot stomped on him, the sound like that of tiles cracking was heard.</p>

  <p>His body naturally had become incredibly fragile under the low temperature after he was frozen. And just like that, his body had turned into powder.</p>

  <p>It was unbelievable that another Demi-holy Being had died! They had now lost six Demi-holy Beings altogether.</p>

  <p>The figure, who actually crushed the frozen Demi-holy Being, turned out to be a tall Demon Ice Sculpture.</p>

  <p>The scenario was already expected by the woman but the situation of the alliance of powerful clans was even worse.</p>

  <p>When they just broke into this world, it was calm and without danger.</p>

  <p>Their group was led by Nicholas as they flew towards one direction.</p>

  <p>They had not gone far when they encountered the Demon Ice Sculpture standing on the ice plain.</p>

  <p>There were no energy fluctuations nor any aura from its body. It looked like an ordinary ice sculpture.</p>

  <p>A Holy Being even got close to it just to observe.</p>

  <p>They were too loose on their guard that to everyone's surprise, as soon as the Holy Being got close, a stream of white cold air spewed out from the mouth of the Demon Ice Sculpture. It happened too sudden.</p>

  <p>The Holy Being was frozen in an instant. Then the Demon Ice Sculpture took the chance and slapped him.</p>

  <p>"Crack..."</p>

  <p>In mere seconds, a powerful figure had directly turned into ice pieces.</p>

  <p>No one had expected that such a thing would happen. Nicholas hadn't expected it either!</p>

  <p>The Holy Being was ranked in the middle among his peers. However, he was shattered into pieces merely by a slap, which shocked everyone.</p>

  <p>The Demon Ice Sculpture didn't stop but let out a roar. It moved its gaze to the rest of the group and started to advance towards them.</p>

  <p>Some Holy Beings and Demi-holy Beings held their stance and counter attacked.</p>

  <p>But no matter what method they used, it became useless once it got close to the Demon Ice Sculpture. Be it fire attack or thunder attack, the energy in their attacks would stop or slow down, and finally dissipate!</p>

  <p>During the fight, they lost another two Holy Beings and four Demi-holy Beings. They were being frozen and crushed to ashes.</p>

  <p>Realizing that they couldn't fight with the Demon Ice Sculpture head-on, they fled immediately.</p>

  <p>In the process of the escape, another Holy Being died.</p>

  <p>However, none of the consummate True Gods died. They knew that their strength was not strong enough and they tried not to bring trouble to the group the whole time. The reason why none of them had lost their lives was that they had already gone far away and run first to escape.</p>
