<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Xun had high hopes for Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>To be exact, she didn't just have high hopes, she had placed her entire faith in him.</p>

  <p>It wasn't because he was the only person in the universe who could help her. Xun knew well that she could contact her old subordinates once she ascended to the Upper World. She'd even be able to ask help from Supreme Lord Leroy.</p>

  <p>However, there was just that gut feeling inside of her that knew Luo Zheng would be the one to ultimately help her regain her throne.</p>

  <p>Opening the entrance of the underground palace might have been coincidence or it might also be another manifestation of Zheng's incredible luck.</p>

  <p>Xun remembered her own journey within the abyss of the underground palace in the past. She hadn't been able to pass the fourth round which was a great pity on her part. This underground palace in the Dark World held a lot of secrets, some even more special than others and she failed to uncover them at that time.</p>

  <p>That was why Xun added those words.</p>

  <p>However, all Luo Zheng did was nod and that was when she knew that her worries had all been unnecessary.</p>

  <p>She should know by now that Luo Zheng wasn't someone who gave up easily.</p>

  <p>She had not forgotten his trial back at the Killing Sword Mountain where each step was torture and took everything from him. However, even if Luo Zheng consistently reached his limit, he never backed down.</p>

  <p>He was someone who never gave up, someone who gave it his all and then some more. There had been no need to remind him.</p>

  <p>Xun was the Demon Night race's sharpest sword. She had led her entire race to conquer many supreme worlds. Each step she took was tinged with the blood of her enemies.</p>

  <p>She wasn't warm, far from it. Xun was cold and ruthless-a hardened killer but there was this sense of relief every time she shrank into Zheng's body. There was just this feeling of security she had with him.</p>

  <p>Falling into this Endless Abyss meant endless and unexpected dangers for all of them. A split-second distraction was all it took for one to lose his life, however, Xun did not feel the slightest bit of worry. And that was all because of him-Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The aforementioned young man wasn't aware of the things currently running through Xun's head. He was way too focused on his fall.</p>

  <p>The previous Blade Mountain Trap hadn't posed that much a threat but that only meant that things were about to turn up a notch soon enough.</p>

  <p>If he ever felt that the next round was too dangerous then he would urge Freya to activate the divine texture first. He didn't care about the others, only about those who chose to follow him like Freya so he would always prioritize her safety.</p>

  <p>Just as he decided on this, a cold chill came from below. "The temperature has dropped.</p>

  <p>This must be the extremely cold test," Xun said.</p>

  <p>True to what she said, the more they descended, the colder the Endless Abyss got.</p>

  <p>A couple of meters down, Luo Zheng noticed white frost appeared on the walls indicating just how frigid the temperature had gotten.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could feel his own body temperature decrease. The temperature had now dropped to frighteningly low levels and the freezing air that rushed past him felt like icicle claws scratching at his cheeks.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had no choice but to circulate his strength through his body, otherwise, his blood was sure to freeze! However, just as he initiated the circulation of his strength, he quickly realized that it wouldn't be enough to help him get through this icy test.</p>

  <p>How could he ever hope to pass it when even the air itself seemed to have frozen?</p>

  <p>Beams of milky white gas floated through the space, slowing everything down at an abnormal rate.</p>

  <p>First, it was the walls, then the air, now even their speed had been affected by the freezing temperatures!</p>

  <p>The air right now was extremely buoyant which made their descent slow down considerably.</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Not willing to die here in the cold, Luo Zheng quickly used his chaotic energy to summon a ring of flame around him.</p>

  <p>However, the effort was futile. As soon as the flames ignited, the white fog quickly wrapped around the fire and extinguished it instantly!</p>

  <p>"This chilling air…" Luo Zheng muttered, his teeth chattering from the cold.</p>

  <p>A single step had proven to be quite a challenging feat given his circumstances and the same could be said for his companions.</p>

  <p>A few had tried to use protective life vitality to shield their body from the elements, however, temperatures this low would prove to be too much to handle. These warriors could only watch helplessly as their protective shields froze and cracked, exposing them to the unforgiving chill of the abyss.</p>

  <p>After cracking, the life vitality that formed the shields would've normally dissipated into the air.</p>

  <p>However, that wasn't what happened. The life vitality simply remained solid and slowly embedded itself onto the white, frosted walls of the abyss!</p>

  <p>Realizing that their life vitality was useless, many of the warriors copied what Luo Zheng did and tried to activate their Fire Law in the hopes of wrapping their bodies in the flames for warmth.</p>

  <p>Zheng's flames, activated using chaotic energy, lasted only around ten seconds. The other warriors' flames burned for less than that - they were now truly at a disadvantage!</p>

  <p>What could they do now? Passing through this area wasn't going to be easy.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Freya seemed to be performing well. Perhaps it was because of her specialization with ice attributed cultivation methods, she didn't seem to have too much trouble with this area. She appeared to be even more relaxed than Luo Zheng at that moment.</p>

  <p>However, although the temperature was terrifyingly low, it was not a deadly threat to the warriors.</p>

  <p>There were two ways that the warriors identified to get through this: First, they could stimulate their life vitality and let it circulate through their bodies. It would maintain the blood circulation in their veins and maintain a certain degree of heat in their internal organs.</p>

  <p>Second, they could use their life vitality to condense flames. The flames only lasted for a couple of seconds at a time but it was enough to provide them a great deal of warmth. Since there were quite a number of them who were making this effort, they could share the flames together.</p>

  <p>This lasted for about an hour.</p>

  <p>By this time, even the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors were weak and pale. All of them looked like frozen zombies with their dark purple lips and sunken faces.</p>

  <p>A warrior could usually endure extreme environments but this was a whole new level of extreme. Those who really couldn't take it had used the divine texture to return. The potential of finding great treasure was tempting but temptation could only push one so far. Not many people were willing to risk their lives just for mere precious trinkets after all.</p>

  <p>For those that remained, they held onto the hope that they would soon pass through this area. However, just as they were thinking it was all going to be over, a diamond-shaped ice crystal with the size of a human suddenly appeared below them!</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The appearance of this huge diamond-shaped crystal caused Luo Zheng to feel as if his brain was about to freeze from the intense cold!</p>

  <p>His reaction time was much slower and it was only when the crystal was around fifty to sixty feet away from him did Luo Zheng realize what was happening! He quickly twisted his body and dodged the oncoming projectile!</p>

  <p>He was lucky to have avoided it, as did Lincoln and Freya.</p>

  <p>However, a human warrior had been too slow.</p>

  <p>An ordinary ice crystal wasn't too dangerous. Even one that was the size of a mountain wouldn't pose that much harm to a hardened warrior.</p>

  <p>However, this was not an ordinary crystal. The moment it made contact with the unfortunate warrior's skin, the crystal immediately froze him and smashed his body into pieces from the sheer impact!</p>

  <p>Clang!</p>

  <p>It was a terrible sound, like a piece of shattering glass or porcelain.</p>

  <p>The sight horrified many. Luo Zheng, and most of the warriors in the abyss sported grave expressions on their faces upon realizing the gravity of danger their lives were currently in.</p>
