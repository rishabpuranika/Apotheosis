  <p>
</p>

  <p>After Luo Zheng had completely mastered the Blood-controlling Method, he went to meet the Monkey Spirit King again.</p>

  <p>The latter was surprised to see Luo Zheng's coral blood sword. It was an unusual thing.</p>

  <p>However, as a monkey, he knew no more about the ancestry-level bloodline than Tearrag did.</p>

  <p>Even if he knew nothing about it at all, it wouldn't matter. All he cared about was whether Luo Zheng could grant him the blended bloodlines. He was not interested in the ancestry-level bloodline itself; not unless he could fuse with it.</p>

  <p>His past had been rather unfortunate. He was unable to fuse with the ancestry-level bloodline before his corporeal body got destroyed. He might have had a chance at that time. But now, he had become a Treacherous Being, which meant it was impossible for him to do so anymore.</p>

  <p>"Alas, I was under the impression that Kincaid had left the methods of merging bloodlines somewhere here," the Monkey Spirit King sighed.</p>

  <p>There was a look of regret and helplessness on his face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng cupped his hands towards him and said, "Don't worry. I am sure we can still find a way."</p>

  <p>"Really? Is there something you can do?" the Monkey Spirit King asked disdainfully.</p>

  <p>He admired Kincaid from the bottom of his heart.</p>

  <p>In his eyes, only Kincaid could help him in this world. Luo Zheng was nothing to him and he was only paying the man any attention because there was a slight chance Luo Zheng could help him.</p>

  <p>Besides, Luo Zheng, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess were all fake human spirits.</p>

  <p>The only reason the Monkey Spirit King hadn't chased them away was that they had saved his life. In any case, it was preposterous to expect them to come up with a way to merge the bloodlines.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng himself knew the Monkey Spirit King was rather arrogant. And to be honest, if he were the Monkey Spirit King, he would also have looked down upon the humans.</p>

  <p>However, he said in a tone that was neither humble nor pushy, "Although we are not human spirits, we still are sentient, intelligent beings. The Primeval Lord of Heaven managed to merge the source-level bloodlines even though there were only a few dozen of them. You should have noticed this before."</p>

  <p>Looking back, when the Monkey Spirit King had been trapped in the dream, he had felt the auras of the blended bloodlines, which had brought him a little glimmer of hope.</p>

  <p>"Is it true? Did you do that?" the Monkey Spirit King asked, staring at the Primeval Lord of Heaven.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the Primeval Lord of Heaven said.</p>

  <p>"Good job." The Monkey Spirit King suddenly complimented him with a laugh and then continued in a serious tone, "If you want me to give you some benefits, you can ask directly. Whatever you do, don't lie to me about blended bloodlines. Although I'm not good at studying, I'm not a fool! And I can easily spot a liar!"</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King suddenly began burning with anger. Luo Zheng, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess immediately felt a heavy stone-like pressure pressing down on their hearts.</p>

  <p>It was true! The Monkey Spirit King was not stupid, and neither were the Monkey Masters. In fact, they were extremely intelligent creatures, and their intuition was quite strong.</p>

  <p>Lying to them was impossible!</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had the ancestry-level bloodline in his body. If the Primeval Lord of Heaven really was confident about merging bloodlines, he would never have bargained in this vague way.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King knew this very well.</p>

  <p>"Please calm down, Monkey Spirit King," Luo Zheng called out, cupping his hands once again. "You misunderstood me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, really?" the Monkey Spirit King sneered coldly.</p>

  <p>He hated a lot of things but what he hated most was when others treated him as a fool. Kincaid was an exception.</p>

  <p>"From what we could learn and decipher from the stone tablets in the coffin, we can merge bloodlines, and the process is not difficult. However, it will take a long time, and we will need a lot of manpower as well as material resources," Luo Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>"I am patient! I can wait," the Monkey Spirit King replied as he waved his hand.</p>

  <p>The wind pressure he was exerting on the people in front of him was lifted. A noise like rolling giant stones could be heard in the hall when that happened.</p>

  <p>He had been waiting for countless years. He had all the time in the world.</p>

  <p>"You can, but the chaos cannot! And the Snake Masters and the Bird Masters can't either. They will definitely not be satisfied with this," said Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>"They can come if they want to. No one is blocking them!" the Monkey Spirit King replied indifferently.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit Sect was like the weapon of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>And the Monkey Spirit King himself was the strongest weapon in the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>Those birds and snakes meant nothing to him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, and the Snake Goddess fell silent when they saw his expression.</p>

  <p>They knew that the Monkey Spirit Sect had once been defeated by the Snake Spirit Sect.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King clearly realized what they were thinking about and said in a low, diffident voice, "Look! If we were in the main world, those snakes would have been torn to pieces by my hands. Even if Cornelius himself were to confront me, he would face no good end. But it is hard to say what would happen in the chaos."</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King had been completely invincible in the main world.</p>

  <p>"We are familiar with the chaos. As the continuation of human spirits, we will try our best to help you. But you must understand that it's difficult for us to fight them or stand against them. Please grant us the Blood-controlling Methods, and let us fuse with a few Treacherous Beings. That way, we will at least stand a chance against the Snake Spirit Sect. And we will fight alongside your sect."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng made a request again.</p>

  <p>The Ghost Mountain had once had several strict rules.</p>

  <p>Only the Great Ghost Priests were allowed to fuse with hatred-level Treacherous Beings.</p>

  <p>Among the human heroes, only four of them had obtained hatred-level Treacherous Beings, while the others merely had resentment-level ones.</p>

  <p>But the most important thing right now was the Blood-controlling Methods.</p>

  <p>They could increase the power of one's own bloodline by a factor of three, which was an extremely strong boost for the human heroes.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was trying his best right now, and saying whatever he needed in order to persuade the Monkey Spirit King.</p>

  <p>The human race didn't only need help from the Monkey Spirit Sect. They also needed the sect to treat them as allies, just like they had been allies with the Human Spirit Sect before. This was much more important than any help they could give.</p>

  <p>The Monkey Spirit King looked at Luo Zheng with his big eyes. He knew clearly what Luo Zheng was implying.</p>

  <p>But to him, Luo Zheng was like a child making an unreasonable request to an adult. It was ridiculous.</p>

  <p>However, the Monkey Spirit King had an intuition that he should trust this human.</p>

  <p>And that was only because of the ancestry-level bloodline.</p>

  <p>Kincaid knew the most about the ancestry-level bloodline. Luo Zheng's fusion with the ancestry-level bloodline was sure to have something to do with Kincaid.</p>

  <p>Kincaid's decision was always the right one.</p>

  <p>Thinking about that, the Monkey Spirit King felt relieved, and then put on a lazy look. "Tearrag, take them to fetch the Blood-controlling Methods.</p>

  <p>They can choose whatever Treacherous Beings they like in the Ghost Mountain."</p>

  <p>If he were to be honest, the Monkey Spirit King had a few measures he could use to control Luo Zheng. However, he had always trusted his instincts, and he was going to do the same today.</p>

  <p>Right now, he was treating these humans as members of the Human Spirit Sect, so he would not resort to those despicable methods.</p>

  <p>Very soon, Luo Zheng and the others left the Ghost Mountain and went to the grotto in the south of the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>As soon as Luo Zheng announced news of fusion with hatred-level Treacherous Beings, the humans in the grotto got excited.</p>

  <p>The Snake Goddess, Fuxi, Ying, King Ieuan and the three Eternal Realm Hunters looked at Luo Zheng with expectant eyes. They were wondering whether they could fuse with Treacherous Beings as well.</p>

  <p>After all, they had come from outside the Night View Island.</p>

  <p>Of course, Luo Zheng knew what they wanted. He smiled faintly and then set them at ease. "Everyone can choose a Treacherous Being and fuse with it.</p>

  <p>I also have another piece of good news."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" the Snake Goddess asked.</p>

  <p>"The Monkey Masters will give you the Blood-controlling Methods," Luo Zheng replied with a smile.</p>

  <p>"What are they?" Fuxi asked in a confused tone.</p>

  <p>"They are methods to activate the bloodlines of the Four Spirits Sect.</p>

  <p>They can improve your bloodline power," Luo Zheng explained.</p>

  <p>Chiyou asked curiously, "Really? How much improvement? I mean how much of a difference would it make?"</p>

  <p>"A lot! They can improve your bloodline power by about three times,"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied with another big smile.</p>
