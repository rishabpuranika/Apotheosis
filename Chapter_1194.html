<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Hearing what the girl said, Luo Zheng couldn't help but roll his eyes. Perhaps, he had met a mad woman.</p>

  <p>The good thing was that she did not immediately kill him, otherwise, with her strength she might be able to destroy his soul within seconds…</p>

  <p>The problem was that if he really was confined in here, the situation could get quite troublesome.</p>

  <p>As he was lost in thought, a spiritual wave suddenly came over him.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you seem to have run into some trouble." This wave had come from the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>The cyan dragon and the mysterious furnace were inside the head of his physical body, but Luo Zheng had already confirmed before that he was still able to communicate with the cyan dragon while his soul and body were separated. As for how the cyan dragon managed to know what Luo Zheng was up to, the latter had no idea.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is a little problem. I seem to have met a crazy woman," Luo Zheng muttered.</p>

  <p>"Crazy woman?" the cyan dragon asked in a strange voice.</p>

  <p>"Hmm…" Luo Zheng narrated to him everything that had happened in the cemetery.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng mentioned that the woman's pupils were golden, the cyan dragon interrupted him, "Are you telling me that this woman has a pair of golden eyes and was sealed within the crystal coffin?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Luo Zheng answered.</p>

  <p>"Haha, so that explains it." The cyan dragon's laughter rang through Zheng's ears.</p>

  <p>"What's so funny? You're a powerful figure in Genuine Dragon race.</p>

  <p>Don't you have some way of helping me out?" Luo Zheng asked, irritated.</p>

  <p>At this moment, the woman stared at Zheng's soul and asked, "Who are you speaking to?"</p>

  <p>This world within the woman's body had been created by herself. Even though Luo Zheng had communicated with the cyan dragon through his own perception, she still noticed that he was talking to someone.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pursed his lips and ignored her. The voice of the cyan dragon came through once again. "Luo Zheng, ask her if her name is Brianna Feng."</p>

  <p>"You know her?" Luo Zheng asked him.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," the cyan dragon replied. From his tone, it seemed that he was immersed in past memories.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng nodded. With a smile on his face, he spoke to the woman. "Someone wants to know if you are Brianna Feng."</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng said the name, the woman's body trembled. The earth and heavens of this world were shaking violently…</p>

  <p>Rumble…</p>

  <p>With a crash of thunder, the entire island vibrated. The life vitality sea roared. Huge waves with the size of small mountains swept toward the island.</p>

  <p>On the island, the aboriginal humans were in a state of panic. They were fleeing and murmuring something in a language that Luo Zheng did not understand. It had probably been created by this woman herself…</p>

  <p>This world was the woman's creation, so it reflected her state of mind.</p>

  <p>What Luo Zheng just said had obviously caused some sort of turmoil in her heart.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng saw the apocalyptic scene before him, he gasped. Confused, he wondered what the big deal was. Wasn't it just a name? Did she have to make such a fuss about it?</p>

  <p>"Who...who told you my name?" Brianna Feng asked, still staring at Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Before Luo Zheng could say anything, the cyan dragon spoke again, "Tell her that it's her grandpa Josh."</p>

  <p>Hearing this, Luo Zheng chuckled with amusement. "Really? She is your granddaughter?"</p>

  <p>Josh was a Genuine Dragon, but this woman wasn't. Luo Zheng had heard that after a legendary beast progressed to a certain level, it could take a human form. Luo Zheng wondered if it meant that Brianna Feng was a Genuine Dragon too.</p>

  <p>The woman stared at Luo Zheng with burning eyes and repeated her question,</p>

  <p>"Tell me, who is it?"</p>

  <p>"He said he's your grandpa Josh!" Luo Zheng laughed.</p>

  <p>Boom…</p>

  <p>Lightning flashed across the sky, silver sparks the shape of snakes crashing down into the sea. In the outside world, such lightning would perhaps not be as scary. However, in the world inside the woman's body, the streak of lightning was comparable to a large mountain. From the looks of it, it was quite frightening.</p>

  <p>Seeing this woman in a frenzy, Luo Zheng couldn't help but sigh, "Could you calm down a bit…"</p>

  <p>But the young girl's face betrayed her sorrow. She couldn't hold it any longer and finally began to wail.</p>

  <p>However, she was still in the form of her soul. Thus, when she cried, Luo Zheng only heard the sound but did not see any tears.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng felt even more helpless now. He did not know if he should remain quiet or pacify her. Although she looked like a little girl, she was in fact much older than some of the oldest masters.</p>

  <p>"Cyan dragon, what should I do now?" Luo Zheng could only turn to the cyan dragon for help.</p>

  <p>"Tell her to stop crying," the cyan dragon replied calmly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng could only convey this to the girl, "Your grandfather is telling you not to cry!"</p>

  <p>It worked. Just as Luo Zheng uttered these words, Brianna Feng stopped crying altogether and stared at Luo Zheng blankly. "Why is my grandpa Josh with you?" she whispered. "What about the other grandpas…"</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell her the truth?" Luo Zheng asked the cyan dragon.</p>

  <p>Up until now, Luo Zheng had never revealed the secrets of the mysterious furnace and the nine Genuine Dragons to anyone. Even the black flame within the furnace was to be used only as a last resort. The only other person who knew of the nine Genuine Dragons was Xun.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was understandably cautious and hesitant.</p>

  <p>"She's not an outsider, so you can tell her everything," the cyan dragon assured him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng shrugged and told her about the nine Genuine Dragons. He then added, "Looks like these nine Genuine Dragons are your grandfathers…"</p>

  <p>Brianna Feng nodded, her expression miserable. "I see."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng heaved a sigh of relief. He was glad that she was able to understand it. It seemed that this woman wasn't all that crazy after all. She too was one of them. If that was the case, then what he dealt with ahead would be easy to handle.</p>

  <p>If he had known that this matter could be resolved in such a way, he would not have wasted his precious time arguing with her.</p>

  <p>"Now that you understand, it's all good. Would you let me go?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>Brianna Feng blinked, her eyes seemingly vacant. "Why should I let you go?"</p>

  <p>"What? Do you still want me to stay with you and create this world?"</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng asked her crossly. This woman seemed to have a deep relationship with the nine Genuine Dragons, so she shouldn't make things difficult for him for no reason.</p>

  <p>"I am under the Soul Sealing Spell of the Soul Race, so my soul is imprisoned inside the world within my body. This spell cannot be broken, and I cannot control my own body," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng had noticed something strange in her before. Brianna Feng had been in chains and sealed in the crystal coffin, so her body could not move at all. It seemed that she had been locked up for countless years. A Spirit Supreme Realm warrior's life span was longer than that of a mighty warrior of the Soul Sea Realm. Her lifespan should still be of a hundred thousand years.</p>

  <p>However, from what Brianna Feng had said, she spent one hundred thousand years just creating the creatures in her world, and yet she hadn't entered the Five Aging Processes. Luo Zheng assumed that she had used some sort of technique to delay that.</p>

  <p>The technique, apparently, was the Soul Sealing Spell. But she wasn't the one who had imposed it on herself, it had been someone else!</p>

  <p>To a certain extent, the Soul Sealing Spell was able to delay the Five Aging Processes. In the Upper World, there were truly some powerful ones who could use this technique to extend their lifespans.</p>

  <p>However, the drawbacks of the method were obvious. Before anyone removed the Soul Sealing Spell, they would lose completely control of their body. Then their soul would be confined within their body. Except for creating their own worlds to kill time, there was nothing else that they could do then…</p>

  <p>Ordinary cultivators at the Spirit Supreme Realm could create a world in their cinnabar field using just a wisp of their souls. They did not need the entirety of their souls to enter the world.</p>

  <p>Brianna Feng had been deliberately put into a helpless situation. Her soul had been sealed into her cinnabar field by someone else.</p>

  <p>"I do not have control on my body, but if your soul has fused with the Soul Core, then I can help you control it!" Brianna Feng said, smiling widely.</p>

  <p>Could it work that way? Luo Zheng was speechless, but his face revealed his joy.</p>

  <p>Controlling her body had originally been Zheng's goal from the beginning itself. It seemed that he would be able to achieve his goal. However, he did not anticipate that the process would be so strange...</p>

  <p>He was fortunate that Brianna Feng and the cyan dragon were family. In the absence of this turn of events, he would have been in great trouble.</p>

  <p>Facing a soul of a master at the Spirit Supreme Realm, Luo Zheng would have had no way to survive.</p>
