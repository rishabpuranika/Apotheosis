  <p>
</p>

  <p>The passageway erupted into an uproar after the warrior of the Earth Tremor race was swallowed by the black snake. The Other Shore creatures at the front even began backpedaling non-stop.</p>

  <p>"It's the Evil Orochi!"</p>

  <p>"Could it really be?"</p>

  <p>"I know this time has not been ordinary, but why did an Evil Orochi have to appear?"</p>

  <p>They all fell deep into despair when they saw the black snake known as the Evil Orochi.</p>

  <p>Many Other Shore creatures had been studying the No-break Maze and the Eternal Scroll Painting diligently for many chaotic eras.</p>

  <p>Most were very clear on what beasts would appear in which part of the maze, the beasts' strength and how to deal with them. It was well established that the road chosen by the Three Eyes race was abundant in Poisonous Leeches and the path the Violet Cloud race often took possessed a large number of Devil Shadow Butterflies.</p>

  <p>There were usually powerful beasts guarding the end of the maze.</p>

  <p>They were few in number, but they were seriously powerful.</p>

  <p>Among them was the beast known as Worm Tapir. It had appeared on the first page before but often appeared at the end of the maze.</p>

  <p>Although Worm Tapirs were powerful and their movements were erratic, there was usually only one of them guarding the end of the maze, so it likely would not cause any devastation like that on the first page.</p>

  <p>There were also other beasts of different shapes and sizes that had appeared at the end of the maze.</p>

  <p>All were extremely powerful but had their weaknesses.</p>

  <p>For instance, Worm Tapir, due to its shape, couldn't enter the room with a hexagram array. The attack of another venomous beast was terrifying but it moved slowly...</p>

  <p>In addition to these common beasts, there were also some rare ones such as the Wall Ghost and Earth Monkey. If they came across these, all that could be done was pray for luck.</p>

  <p>The Wall Ghost and Earth Monkey were still not the most powerful beasts around though. Undoubtedly, the most powerful and the rarest, was this giant serpent before them, Evil Orochi!</p>

  <p>In recorded years, it had only appeared five times and when it did appear, none of the creatures had reached the Eternal Realm.</p>

  <p>When it appeared the first time, the Other Shore creatures that had entered the Eternal Scroll Painting did not know of its strength. As a result, almost all of them were killed.</p>

  <p>Things ended much better on its second appearance. Those who had entered knew they stood no chance against it and simply surrendered and were eventually kicked out of the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>From then on things continued in this way. If warriors were unlucky enough to meet the serpent, they chose to give up, which could at least allow them to escape with their lives.</p>

  <p>This was why when the Other Shore creatures saw the Evil Orochi this time, they all heaved heavily. They stood no chance and would have to give up.</p>

  <p>"It seems you are quite unlucky. You've encountered this beast on your first entry into the Eternal Scroll Painting," Egan said with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>The image of this giant snake flashing by replayed in Luo Zheng's mind. He frowned and asked, "Is it really as powerful as you say?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Egan firmly. "Not a single soul had managed to survive it."</p>

  <p>"We can't go forward. We'll just wait till the next time the Eternal Scroll Painting opens," said Kirk standing beside him.</p>

  <p>They weren't the only ones feeling this way; the other creatures were resigned to surrender as well.</p>

  <p>They had time to wait for their next opportunity. After all, they had been faced with the Evil Orochi, and there was no shame in leaving empty handed.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng would not back down so easily. Egan had said this giant snake was invincible but he still asked the Primeval Lord of Heaven for advice before he made any kind of move.</p>

  <p>"Its first appearance that the boy from the Three Eyes race mentioned occurred in the 83rd chaos, the 5th chaotic era after our human race entered the Grand Plain Stage," explained the Primeval Lord of Heaven. "Nine of the human race entered the Eternal Scroll Painting and none returned. If I had entered with them, I fear I would not have come back either."</p>

  <p>Back then, the human race's power in the Grand Plain Stage was not small and there were certainly a large number of human warriors strong enough to enter the Eternal Scroll Painting every time.</p>

  <p>And yet even the Primeval Lord of Heaven would have had no chance of coming out victoriously against the Evil Orochi. Luo Zheng made his mind up fast and decided to give up on entering the third page and would instead wait for the end of the Eternal Scroll Painting.</p>

  <p>Just then, as many Other Shore creatures accepted their choice to give up, a black light flashed from below their gaze.</p>

  <p>This left everyone stunned. 'Is this another gigantic snake?' they wondered.</p>

  <p>Once they had transformed into pictures, they couldn't look in all directions.</p>

  <p>From their vantage point, the end and exit of the maze were above the other parts. But the flash had come from below.</p>

  <p>"Is that... Another huge snake?"</p>

  <p>"T... Two snakes?"</p>

  <p>"Will it come in?"</p>

  <p>Some trembling voices spoke their fears.</p>

  <p>Encountering an Evil Orochi was already incredibly unlucky.</p>

  <p>The Eternal Scroll Painting had opened and closed countless times and the Evil Orochi only appeared five times. But there were no records in history of two appearing at once!</p>

  <p>Everyone discussed in shaky voices and then the Evil Orochi swept past them from below once more while another passed overhead. These two snakes now blocked off everyone in the passageway.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, they just passed by and disappeared in seconds.</p>

  <p>But even their shadows flashing past in the blink of an eye was terrifying for all the Other Shore creatures.</p>

  <p>"Do you think they can enter this passageway?" asked one of the creatures.</p>

  <p>With this question hanging out there, everyone's nerves rattled much more.</p>

  <p>They had not been told of any safe areas in the No-break Maze, but those who had been unwilling to rush forward would wait in this passageway, hoping it was safe enough.</p>

  <p>But was it really safe?</p>

  <p>"It... It should be safe here..." another creature replied, quivering in fear.</p>

  <p>"Well, generally, Other Shore creatures at the end of the maze won't come in," said Kirk confidently.</p>

  <p>"But that Evil Orochi doesn't come from the end," said Egan, frowning.</p>

  <p>Several abnormalities had occurred in the Eternal Scroll Painting this time and now the impossible seemed to be unfolding before them. Who was to say whether this passageway was safe or not?</p>

  <p>Egan's words shrouded everyone's hearts in an ominous dark cloud. "Shut up!" screamed Walden.</p>

  <p>Egan had long been displeased with the Violet Cloud race and replied coldly, "I was talking to my friends!"</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>Just as Walden was about to retort, the Evil Orochi swept across again from below. This time, halfway through, it suddenly drilled into the passageway.</p>

  <p>Their greatest fear was being realized.</p>

  <p>They had remained vigilant in the passageway; still and cautious. So the moment they saw the Evil Orochi rush into the passageway, they all rushed upwards.</p>

  <p>If they stayed there, they would surely die. Rushing to the exit of the maze at least gave them a chance at survival, even if only a small one.</p>
