<br/><br/>

  

  <p>After Geoffrey's brief talk with the little monster, he formed a general understanding of the situation in the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>The Deep Space was no longer as glorious as it had been in the past.</p>

  <p>Although these newly born creatures were fifth-grade creatures, they were not as strong as the Cinnabar race and the Fostering race.</p>

  <p>Moreover, most of the creatures were still in an extremely primitive state.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey had taken note of this in the tests.</p>

  <p>However, given enough time, any civilization could be capable of building itself slowly from ruins.</p>

  <p>Over the long years, some races had gained intelligence, established strong social structures, and expanded their territories. The little monster came from a race called the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>The Elemental race had not been considered a powerful race at first. In fact, they were quite weak, and had almost been annihilated twice in their history. There were countless minor races like the Elemental race that had been wiped out completely.</p>

  <p>When the Elemental race was in crisis, they met a human spirit— Elder Xue, who had been mentioned by Geoffrey.</p>

  <p>Although Elder Xue was an elder of the Bold Conjecture House and his strength was at the top level in the Abstruse Energy World, he was weak in the Deep Space. After all, the power levels in the Deep Space were different.</p>

  <p>However, Elder Xue possessed extraordinary wisdom. This was exactly what the members of the Elemental race lacked.</p>

  <p>He had won the trust of the Elemental race and joined them. He helped them escape from their original territory, led them as they slowly built up their strength, and taught them the way to enter the Sky Wheel City.</p>

  <p>Countless years had passed since Elder Xue joined the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>Now, after many generations of learning and growth, they had grown in power. These days, no one in the Deep Space underestimated the Elemental race.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning, the little monster had been extremely interested in Geoffrey. The reason was simple. He looked exactly like Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>"Since your race has grown so powerful, how did you get caught?"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey asked.</p>

  <p>"Get caught?" The little monster thought for a moment, then said, "I did it on purpose."</p>

  <p>The answer surprised Geoffrey. He had been caught by accident, so he thought that the other intelligent creatures here had also suffered the same fate. But as it turned out, that was not the case for everyone.</p>

  <p>The little monster pointed at the black ape not far away and said, "He and I came in out of our own free will."</p>

  <p>"Why?" Geoffrey asked.</p>

  <p>"The Sky Wheel City is the strongest and most powerful city. Whoever occupies it will rule the Deep Space," the little monster replied.</p>

  <p>In the Deep Space, there were a total of six powerful races like the Elemental race. They were constantly in conflict with each other, but none had scored a decisive victory over everyone else. This was why they had turned to the Sky Wheel City.</p>

  <p>They believed that this city, the legacy left behind by the most powerful Fostering race, contained the power to rebuild the Deep Space.</p>

  <p>However, ever since the extermination of the Fostering race, the relatively intact Sky Wheel City had shifted to a unique mode. It would kill any trespasser, and the only way to enter it was to be caught by the spiders.</p>

  <p>The creatures that were caught into the Sky Wheel City would then have to take many tests of intelligence.</p>

  <p>"These tests are endless. When will they end?" Geoffrey asked. His voice faltered slightly, for he was not fluent in Sanskrit.</p>

  <p>"No one has reached the end yet," the little monster replied.</p>

  <p>"Then..."</p>

  <p>"Most of the creatures here will die," the little monster said.</p>

  <p>His black eyes held a determined, grim look.</p>

  <p>"Most of them will die? So a small part can survive? Why?" Geoffrey asked.</p>

  <p>It seemed the Sky Wheel City was enacting a method of selection. If the creatures couldn't pass the intelligence tests, they would die, and only those who passed would survive. Thus, since no one had passed the final test so far, then all the creatures that had entered the Sky Wheel City should have died.</p>

  <p>The little monster shook his head. "You'll soon know."</p>

  <p>Geoffrey nodded, falling into a pensive silence.</p>

  <p>He thought that he had gotten very lucky, to have found someone so informative not long after entering the Deep Space. Not only had the little monster told Geoffrey much that he didn't know, he had even been a source of valuable information regarding Elder Xue.</p>

  <p>The only drawback was that he was now in a desperate situation.</p>

  <p>'I want to live!</p>

  <p>I want to get out of the Sky Wheel City alive!</p>

  <p>I want to return to the chaos!' he thought, and vowed that he would find a way out.</p>

  <p>There was a rustling sound as the spiders moved along.</p>

  <p>The three spiders patiently climbed up the stairs. Geoffrey had long since realized that these spiders were not living creatures, but puppets. They were simply carrying out orders.</p>

  <p>After they had been climbing the endless stairs for more than two hours, a wide exit finally appeared ahead of them.</p>

  <p>At the exit was a giant sunken square. A huge, thick chimney stood in the center of the square.</p>

  <p>With a swish, the teeth on the back of the three spiders retracted.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey, the little monster, and the black ape were all free.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was quite agile, and he somersaulted off the back of the spider, landing cleanly on the ground.</p>

  <p>The little monster and the black ape followed suit.</p>

  <p>The three of them looked around. Geoffrey's attention was caught by an enormous box on the ground, outlined by red lines as thick as his arm.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey raised his foot, about to step forward. The black ape beside him saw what he was doing and his lips spread in a strange smile. However, the little monster jumped up, grabbing his arm. "Don't move forward!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey paused, struck by how anxious the little monster seemed.</p>

  <p>Cautiously he asked, "What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Whoever crosses the line on the ground will die," the little monster said.</p>

  <p>Geoffrey was only one step away from the edge of the red box. As soon as the little monster spoke, he immediately took a few steps back. "What? It's so dangerous here!"</p>

  <p>"Follow me," the little monster said.</p>

  <p>They glanced behind them. The three spiders were gone. When they turned back to the box, it began to glow, and two green lines had appeared on the ground from the edge of the red box.</p>

  <p>The little monster waved his hand at Geoffrey and started to walk along a green line. Geoffrey followed carefully.</p>

  <p>The black ape stayed where he was for a while. Other green lines appeared on the red box, one after another. Each line obviously led to a different direction, and the black ape chose a path different from theirs.</p>

  <p>Soon the huge square was filled with the green lines. Following behind the little monster, Geoffrey finally arrived at the left edge of the square.</p>

  <p>Here, there was an oval building. Three members of the Elemental race stood at the entrance of the building.</p>

  <p>It seemed they had been specifically waiting for the little monster. When they saw Geoffrey, their expressions grew shuttered and wary. One of them asked the little monster about Geoffrey's identity.</p>

  <p>The little monster explained in a low voice. The three members of the Elemental race looked at Geoffrey with surprise and uncertainty, but they opened the door of the oval building and welcomed him in.</p>

  <p>There were another seven or eight members of the Elemental race in the oval building. Everyone communicated with each other in their own language. After several moments, they fell quiet and positioned themselves on each side of the room, leaving only one of them in the center.</p>

  <p>The man looked at Geoffrey keenly. With a smile, he asked, "So you are looking for me?"</p>

  <p>He was not speaking in the intricate language of the Elemental race, nor in the difficult speech of Sanskrit. He was speaking in the human language.</p>
