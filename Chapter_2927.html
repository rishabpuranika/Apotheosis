<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2927 Devour The Original Will </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The baby ran over to Luo Zheng, leaving huge footprints on the desert sand.</p>

  <p>Although it looked adorable and innocent, Luo Zheng couldn't help but shiver as it approached him.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you really don't want to be devoured by the baby, I can help you.</p>

  <p>To be honest, if we came here even two years after the original will was born, I wouldn't be able to do anything. Luckily for you, dealing with the original will in its infancy is a piece of cake for me," said No. 9527.</p>

  <p>"You can resist the original will?" Luo Zheng asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"How could that be possible? This is the will of the divine land. Even though it has just been born, it is impossible for me to contend against it. I am only going to guide it," No. 9527 said.</p>

  <p>This only confused Luo Zheng further. "Guide it? How?"</p>

  <p>"I will let it devour me, of course."</p>

  <p>As soon as No. 9527 said these words, a pale green soul floated out from Luo Zheng's chest.</p>

  <p>This soul was, in fact, only a small part of No. 9527, but it contained enough of its essence and its memories to do the job.</p>

  <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>

  <p>The baby was now only a few hundred feet away from Luo Zheng. The original will did not actually have a body. This was just the form it had taken.</p>

  <p>In this form, it was extremely sensitive to soul power, so No. 9527's soul quickly attracted its attention.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>No. 9527's soul turned out to be very cooperative. After swirling around in the air for a while, it flew into the baby's mouth, and just like that, the baby swallowed the pale green soul.</p>

  <p>The baby smacked its lips and looked at Luo Zheng hungrily. The soul was rather tasty and the baby wanted more.</p>

  <p>However, just as it took a step toward Luo Zheng, its huge body suddenly trembled, and a trace of green gradually appeared in its originally pure eyes.</p>

  <p>Slowly, it swaggered toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Realizing that he could move his body again, Luo Zheng asked in surprise, "What on earth did you do to the baby?"</p>

  <p>It seemed that No. 9527 had successfully tamed the baby.</p>

  <p>"It's simple. It swallowed part of my soul, so now, the original will is contaminated by me. However, there is only one will in the soul that it swallowed, and that is to let you devour it," No. 9527 explained indifferently.</p>

  <p>When Luo Zheng heard this answer, he was speechless. Could the original will of the divine land be tamed that easily? He couldn't believe it.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 understood what Luo Zheng was thinking and disdainfully explained, "I told you that you could just let the original will devour you. In the end, it would have still been you who survived. I just used another way, but the result will be the same."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng pursed his lips. No matter what No. 9527 said, he couldn't imagine allowing the baby to devour him.</p>

  <p>As the baby got closer and closer, its body began to shrink rapidly. At last, it turned into the size of a palm and flew toward Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng was still on high alert. Only after the original will entered his mind and showed no intention of attacking did he finally heave a sigh of relief. He was now sure that the original will had indeed intended to let itself be devoured by him. Luo Zheng no longer hesitated to suck it into his soul.</p>

  <p>Fusing two different souls was an arduous task. Even if one managed to integrate another soul with theirs, there would be a big problem. There was always the risk that the foreign soul would try to expel or even crush the original soul into pieces. As the saying went, one country could not have two queens.</p>

  <p>However, apart from the will of the fragment of No. 9527's soul, there were no other thoughts in the original will. It was very pure, so it was not difficult for Luo Zheng to devour it.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, devouring the original will of the divine land was not a task that could be completed instantly. After all, the divine land was large and powerful, and so was its will.</p>

  <p>Four hours later, a cross quietly appeared in the space between Luo Zheng's eyebrows. Then, it disappeared, buried in his forehead.</p>

  <p>Buzz...</p>

  <p>As Luo Zheng opened his eyes, the Mountain of Holy Beings, which had been floating steadily in the air, shook violently.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked at his hands and then glanced at the world around him. He immediately felt like everything had changed. His understanding of the divine land had been greatly enhanced, and some abilities and knowledge that originally didn't belong to him had come to him.</p>

  <p>This feeling of having control over everything was so peculiar that he could not get used to it.</p>

  <p>As he looked down, a sudden thought flashed in his mind. The colorful desert suddenly sprang to life. Grains of sand quickly moved and arranged themselves in an orderly manner, just like soldiers.</p>

  <p>Then, the desert itself disappeared and was replaced by a colorful staircase.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng climbed the staircase and made his way back to the passageway.</p>

  <p>Before, the maze had been full of twists and turns, and it had been impossible for him to proceed without the guidance of the Infinity Ruler.</p>

  <p>Now, however, the maze kept rearranging itself to show a straight path in front of Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the maze was still large, and the straight path seemed to stretch for thousands of miles. Luo Zheng took a deep breath and mentally prepared himself for the long walk ahead. When he took a single step forward, however, his figure vanished. The next moment, his figure appeared at the entrance of the maze, which was connected to the Mountain of Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>Inside the Mountain of Holy Beings, the competition among the Demi-holy Beings and consummate True Gods had come to the white-hot phase.</p>

  <p>Two of the three holy springs were still empty.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that they didn't want to continue challenging each other for the holy springs. But they had been fighting each other for so long that they were all like spent arrows. Every time someone tried to rush into the holy springs, they would encounter sneak attacks from their opponents. It was too much of a risk to take in such a weak state, so most of them chose to stay behind and watch.</p>

  <p>All of them wanted to recover to their best health in the shortest time possible, so they were pouring pills into their mouths one by one, as if these pills were free.</p>

  <p>By now, Luo Zheng had already passed through the plain and was heading straight for the holy springs.</p>

  <p>Although he seemed to be moving leisurely, the distance he was covering was astonishing.</p>

  <p>The Space Law seemed to have no effect on him. When he took ten steps, he covered the same distance that other people would only cover with a hundred steps. Usually, one would have to use the Grand Teleportation to achieve this effect. However, Luo Zheng wasn't using it. There wasn't even a trace of space fluctuation around him.</p>

  <p>One of the competitors noticed Luo Zheng and his strange movements.</p>

  <p>"Everybody, look, Luo Zheng is here again!"</p>

  <p>In view of Luo Zheng's terrifying power, no one dared to ignore him. They all stared at him in awe.</p>

  <p>"Why has he come back here?"</p>

  <p>"Is he planning to occupy a holy spring again?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe he will try it again!"</p>

  <p>These people immediately became nervous. They knew that even though Luo Zheng's attempt to bathe in the holy spring had failed, he would be unwilling to accept it.</p>

  <p>And if Luo Zheng chose to forcibly occupy a holy spring, they wouldn't be able to do anything about it. After all, none of them was a match for him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng hadn't planned to pay attention to these people at first. But when he heard what they said, he suddenly stopped.</p>
