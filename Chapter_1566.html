<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Zheng wouldn't hide anything from Amber.</p>

  <p>A faint smile hung on his face as he nodded in acknowledgment.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Vivian and the other Demon Night warriors followed behind.</p>

  <p>But Aurora's words had stunned Vivian for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Tianxing is Zheng…"</p>

  <p>He was the human warrior who had managed to trick and kill Supreme Lord Gunter.</p>

  <p>Vivian's family was a side branch of the Demon Night. Six Years ago, Maddox stood as the branch's leader and participated in hunting Zheng down ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>It was difficult to determine who was on the right side of that internal strife. But after confirming that Tianxing was Zheng, Vivian was astonished.</p>

  <p>Regardless of anything, since Zheng was Amber's friend, he could probably be trusted.</p>

  <p>With that thought, Aurora and Vivian felt a sense of relief.</p>

  <p>Something flashed slightly in Aurora's eyes before a bright smile appeared on her face. "I didn't know you are Amber's friend. I'm so sorry for offending you earlier. Thank you for helping us."</p>

  <p>With that, she waved her finger and a small, black tree appeared in her hand. The little tree went up to only four feet high, with its branches only as thick as her pinky finger. Not a single leaf was on it.</p>

  <p>As she pulled it out, the branches began quiver before leaves grew from the branches— it was a rather magical sight.</p>

  <p>In the blink of an eye, the bare black tree had turned into a small, fully grown tree. Only when she put it away did she look at Amber, with her situation in mind. When she saw Amber hesitate to say something, she put on a brilliant smile and said, "You two got to meet again, so you probably have things to talk about. Amber is in a predicament right now."</p>

  <p>"A predicament?" Zheng's eyes flashed as he stared at Amber.</p>

  <p>At this moment, embarrassment and uneasiness crept into Amber's demeanor.</p>

  <p>Back in the prison, she had thought of ways to spread the news of her imprisonment.</p>

  <p>But the universe was all too vast— it wasn't an easy task to find a certain man from among a hundred thousand supreme worlds.</p>

  <p>As for the Roaring Token, world lords couldn't even attain them easily, let alone a Soul Sea Realm warrior like Amber.</p>

  <p>Now that she had finally crossed paths with Zheng, it seemed like some kind of act of providence.</p>

  <p>But now that she stood before him, her mind came up blank.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Aurora could see through her nervousness, which made her bring up Amber's situation.</p>

  <p>"That's right. She's imprisoned and has been sentenced to the punishment of being burned and corroded. It's a punishment second only to the Punishment of Eternal Night. Her body has suffered under corrosive rainfall. After a few days of punishment, her eyes rot, her skin festers, and her muscles and bones end up corroded. Her body gets healed through life energy, but after recovering, she's subjected to the same punishment over and over again. It's such torment..."</p>

  <p>After she heard Aurora detail her suffering, Amber's face began to pale.</p>

  <p>For seven whole years, she had lived such a miserable life.</p>

  <p>To have endured such pain...</p>

  <p>Facing challenges in the Illusion Battlefield was one of Amber's best moments.</p>

  <p>There, she had befriended Aurora and some other Demon Night warriors, apart from being able to display her own strength and compete with the strong warriors of the universe.</p>

  <p>But the thought that she would soon have to return to the prison and continue with her punishment— Amber couldn't help but tremble with fear.</p>

  <p>Such torment to a warrior was inhuman.</p>

  <p>An ordinary warrior probably wouldn't have even held on for three years before going completely insane.</p>

  <p>Even if one had a firm will, once that was used up after a number of years, both their mind and body would collapse.</p>

  <p>Since Amber had grown up in the chaotic Sea God Continent, her mind and body were naturally much tougher than that of a warrior who had grown up within the safety of a sacred place. With her firm mind, Amber managed to bear the incessant, intense suffering for seven whole years.</p>

  <p>A trace of chill intent appeared in Zheng's eyes as he pulled a long face. "Is it all because of Yao? It's such a waste that I couldn't kill her that time..."</p>

  <p>That day, he failed to lock Yao in the Desperate Melee. If he had managed to trap her in it, she might've already perished.</p>

  <p>As Zheng said these words, the warriors of the Demon Night were stunned and silent.</p>

  <p>Apart from the upper-level warriors of the Demon Night, most of the other ordinary warriors were still unmovingly devout and loyal. If they weren't, it would've been impossible for the three queens of the Demon Night to accumulate so much Faith Energy.</p>

  <p>When they heard Zheng insult their queen, their notable reaction was no surprise.</p>

  <p>But Aurora remained calm and indifferent.</p>

  <p>Because her mother was a member of the Board of Elders, she naturally knew of the dispute among the Demon Night upper-level warriors. In actuality, many of the world lords were already rather dissatisfied with Yao.</p>

  <p>Zheng had scolded Yao through the Roaring Token— how he cursed her just now was nothing in comparison.</p>

  <p>And Aurora didn't blame Zheng for that, so that kept the other warriors of the Demon Night from taking any reckless action. They only looked at Zheng with hard expressions, holding some hostility in their eyes.</p>

  <p>To most of the members of the Demon Night, the dispute between their queens wasn't something they could meddle in. To them, the queens stood supreme— they were incomparable to anything. Every one of the warriors would defend their queens' dignity at any time, even if it meant sacrificing themselves.</p>

  <p>Silently, Amber nodded.</p>

  <p>Zheng knew all the ins and outs of the conflict. Naturally, he was aware of how Amber had offended Yao because of it.</p>

  <p>But not even he expected that Yao would bear such a grudge against Amber. Even being the supreme queen of the Demon Night, she poured so much hate into punishing a Demon Night member who had ascended from the Lower World— she was merciless.</p>

  <p>And Zheng knew from Aurora that being burnt and corroded was an extremely torturous punishment.</p>

  <p>The ice and indignation in Zheng's eyes grew stronger.</p>

  <p>Standing on top of the huge branch, Zheng looked at the vast and boundless white mist. Then, he turned his head and stared at Amber before exclaiming, "Three years! If you give me another three years, I'll definitely kill Yao and save you from all this!"</p>

  <p>Enduring another three years of punishment was no small feat.</p>

  <p>While she didn't want to bear it any second longer, hearing Zheng proclaim so confidently that he would save her in three years, she couldn't help but feel the anticipation growing within her.</p>

  <p>The loss of hope was everyone's fear.</p>

  <p>Amber's warrior spirit was strong and unyielding. So long as there was even a sliver of hope, she would take it as support.</p>

  <p>Three years was a blink in the life of a warrior.</p>

  <p>In others' eyes, to force a queen of the Demon Night to abdicate and kill her off within three years was merely wishful thinking.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Pool of Faith, Yao, who was fully armed, had become more powerful than a Supreme Lord.</p>

  <p>If there were any warriors in the universe who could possibly take her down, they would have to represent the most powerful forces in the universe.</p>

  <p>If they really wanted to defeat her, they had to consider whether or not their races could be attacked by the Demon Night easily.</p>

  <p>In the entire universe, Zheng was the sole person qualified to do so.</p>

  <p>He had once killed several Supreme Lords, after all.</p>

  <p>Four powerful Supreme Lords had perished at his hands.</p>

  <p>When Zheng said these words, the Demon Night warriors turned even more furious.</p>

  <p>But as their leader, Aurora said nothing. What could the other warriors say?</p>

  <p>But these warriors from the Demon Night were still unconvinced. It was very reckless for a Soul Sea Realm warrior like Zheng to kill their queen within three years.</p>

  <p>The gap between the Soul Sea Realm and the realm of the world lord was indeed wide. The Spirit Supreme Realm and the Spirit Transformation Realm lay between the two cultivation realms.</p>

  <p>To increase their cultivation base and match up to the world lords, some warriors would spend hundreds of thousands of years, even millions of years, to practice their cultivation.</p>

  <p>But Zheng had made a promise that he could bring Yao down in a measly three years.</p>

  <p>"I can endure it for three years," Amber responded with a nod, her eyes gleaming with hope.</p>

  <p>While she wasn't certain Zheng could manage to do it within three years, she was firm in deciding to keep on enduring the years of pain as, at the very least, he had given her hope.</p>

  <p>When Zheng was on the Sea God Continent before, he had already completed numerous seemingly impossible tasks— he was a miracle-maker.</p>

  <p>Rare were people like him.</p>

  <p>When he saw her expression, he couldn't help but feel guilty.</p>

  <p>After all, it was because of him and Xun that Amber was stuck in such an awful predicament.</p>

  <p>Zheng wasn't a savior— he wouldn't deliver all things from suffering or their troubles. But he wouldn't just stay out of the matter if someone he treasured was in trouble.</p>
