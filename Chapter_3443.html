<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's expression changed. There was a troubled look on his face when he heard King Manard's unfriendly tone.</p>

  <p>"Sir, they are both my friends..."</p>

  <p>He began trying to explain, but was interrupted when King Manard said,</p>

  <p>"Whoever they are, they need to show up. No one spies on me in secret!</p>

  <p>Show yourselves or you will force my hands!"</p>

  <p>If Luo Zheng hadn't been concerned in this matter, King Manard would have slain No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit without a moment's hesitation.</p>

  <p>The only reason he was restraining himself was that Luo Zheng was a human.</p>

  <p>Even so, the fact that No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit were spying on him in secret was an unbearably infuriating thought for him.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit immediately turned into two human shaped soul forms, one glowing with a cyan aura and the other one in brown. They put their hands together and bowed to King Manard.</p>

  <p>"We have been staying inside Luo Zheng's body for a long time, and never showed ourselves to anyone till date. We didn't mean to spy on you. Please forgive us," the Regal Jade Spirit humbly apologized.</p>

  <p>King Manard glanced at him and then suddenly smiled. "I'm familiar with your aura. You used to be in charge of this space. You were a Son of Truth of the Regal Jade Civilization. Have I got that right?"</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit nodded with a helpless smile. "You have supernatural power. I didn't sense you hiding here!"</p>

  <p>"If you could detect my presence that easily, I wouldn't be alive today,"</p>

  <p>King Manard smiled with a satisfied expression.</p>

  <p>This space worked in a mysterious way. Every once in a while, everything in here was destroyed for good. This place was often regarded as the garden of the Son of Truth. And no human would ever be allowed to live here!</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit replied, "The theurgies you utilized to break through the walls of the chaos and explore the outside void are impressive. If you could reveal the secrets of this void, we, the Regal Jade Civilization, would be happy to get along with you. That being the case, why would we consider you our enemy?"</p>

  <p>However, King Manard's expressions didn't change. "You might see it that way, but your civilization would still take me as their enemy. They might not share your thoughts. Things on the Other Shore are extremely complicated. You, as a lone Son of Truth, couldn't make that decision by yourself!"</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit didn't know what to say. And to be honest, if he really had sensed King Manard's existence in the past, he would have killed him!</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," King Manard took a long breath and continued, "What's important is that I have managed to survive. And now, even if some Sons of Truth have mastered the space truth, they are not the rulers in this space!"</p>

  <p>The Regal Jade Spirit was surprised to hear this. "Do you mean that even the Sons of Truth cannot control this space?"</p>

  <p>"Of course that's what I am saying," King Manard arrogantly confirmed.</p>

  <p>"The spaces they delete can be found here, but it's impossible to retrieve these spaces back. They can't even look at what's going on inside this space.</p>

  <p>I've deprived them of that right in here."</p>

  <p>His offhand way of saying that he had deprived the Sons of Truth their right was as if he were merely discussing the weather.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng, the Regal Jade Spirit and No. 9527 were extremely shocked when they heard that.</p>

  <p>This was a rule based on the truth. Who could break the truth of the chaos so easily?</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's eyes lit up. Although he was shocked, he also had an idea. "If you have deprived the Sons of Truth of their right, can you also send me out?"</p>

  <p>King Manard glanced at Luo Zheng and asked, "Are you in a hurry to go back?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Luo Zheng nodded, pursing his lips.</p>

  <p>King Manard knew very well that most of the creatures that had been sent into this space had somehow managed to offend the Sons of Truth.</p>

  <p>However, most of the opponents of the Sons of Truth were extremely strong creatures, and King Manard didn't believe Luo Zheng was strong enough to qualify for that.</p>

  <p>"Take your time," King Manard said. "Yes. I can help you find the time node. No matter how much time has passed since you got here, I will be able to send you back at that time node."</p>

  <p>"Locate a specific time node?!"</p>

  <p>Hearing that, the two inhabitants of Luo Zheng's body were shocked again.</p>

  <p>A small world was easy to control.</p>

  <p>If the world in question was someone's inner world, then as its omnipotent creator, it wouldn't be difficult for them to control the time flow rate and even use the Time Backing in that world.</p>

  <p>However, an inner world with messy timelines was not easy to control.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, nobody was ever willing to mess up the timelines of their inner worlds unless absolutely necessary. Time was a powerful entity and changing or editing it could cause chaos!</p>

  <p>In the countless universes, most of the Holy Beings, and even some of the world lords had the power to change time, or even adjust its flow rate.</p>

  <p>However, in the divine land, such abilities had become extremely rare and precious.</p>

  <p>In the Source World and the chaos, it was almost completely impossible to change and control time by directly practicing the theurgies.</p>

  <p>Almost no one could surpass the time truth unless they had the help of some very powerful Other Shore Tokens, which were extremely limited in number.</p>

  <p>As for the time truth, it was impossible for even the Chaos Ancient Gods to master it!</p>

  <p>Therefore, when King Manard said that he could locate a time node and send Luo Zheng back, they were all shocked.</p>

  <p>"That would be amazing!" Luo Zheng's face was filled with intense joy at the chance of possible return.</p>

  <p>King Manard glanced outside the cave. He returned alone this time. The twelve disciples kept on floating outside the chaos. He then said, "Let's go back to the palace first."</p>

  <p>Together, the group soon made their way to the palace that had been built on the Deleting Pillars.</p>

  <p>On their way, King Manard asked Luo Zheng a bit about the situation of the chaos, and the latter told him about the several human forces as well as some of the super forces in the Source World.</p>

  <p>When he heard that the Bearing race and the Divine Farmer race had joined forces to exterminate the Nine Li race, King Manard frowned. He sighed, "I didn't expect the human forces to kill each other!"</p>

  <p>In the time of the King Manard, the human civilization was a united group.</p>

  <p>As a ruling force, it occupied the entire chaos, and no internal conflict was even heard of.</p>

  <p>They had always been united, to the very last possible moment.</p>

  <p>And from the way King Manard detested the other races, it was crystal clear how much he cared about the human race. He had never expected that the newborn human race in the chaos would fall into such a complicated situation. It was heartbreaking for him to hear such news.</p>

  <p>"With your great theurgies, you will be able to end the dispute if you return to the chaos," Luo Zheng suddenly said.</p>

  <p>"Return to the chaos?" King Manard shook his head in a disappointed manner.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you tell us that you have taken complete control over this space and can retrieve everything from within it?" Luo Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>A trace of helplessness appeared on the face of King Manard. He pointed to No. 9527's soul and said, "This one can return to the chaos, and so can you."</p>

  <p>Then he pointed to the Regal Jade Spirit and continued, "But can he return as well?"</p>

  <p>Although No. 9527 and the Regal Jade Spirit had turned into human souls, they were still quite different from each other.</p>

  <p>No. 9527 was a real strand of a soul, while the Regal Jade Spirit had appeared in the chaos after Luo Zheng had merged with the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>In fact, his body was still on the Other Shore. He was in a descending state.</p>

  <p>"You mean..." Luo Zheng's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>King Manard pointed at the ruins in the distance and said, "The chaos that belongs to us has already gone. We can't return to the chaos. Even if we do return, we can only return in the form of an Other Shore Token. Or, to put it shortly, you can treat this space as another Other Shore."</p>
