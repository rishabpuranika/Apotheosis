<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The old man of the Sun Blind race didn't tell Zheng what had happened back then, nor did he tell him what the Emperor Resentment actually looked like.</p>

  <p>In fact, the Sun Blind members were people of few words. They ferried people on the Time Sea, but they seldom spoke with their guests.</p>

  <p>In other words, it was already pretty obscure for the old man to be talking so much with Zheng.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, the old man ended up inviting Zheng to his race in the Astronomical Transit Day.</p>

  <p>Zheng was curious about the Sun Blind race, and thus he accepted the invitation without a second of hesitation. He didn't feel anything strange in the moment, but when he arrived at the Floating Island, he realized that even the ordinary warriors on the Floating Islands had never been invited by the Sun Blind race before.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, the scenery around the boat vanished.</p>

  <p>From their point of view, it appeared as though nothing else existed between heaven and earth on the boundless Time Sea, nothing except the elderly man, Zheng and the boat.</p>

  <p>Unknowingly, Zheng began to fall into an extremely tired and sleepy state.</p>

  <p>He couldn't help but yawn continuously.</p>

  <p>In his mind, he then tried checking in on Master Evil's soul. To his surprise though, Master Evil was in deep slumber.</p>

  <p>Zheng was puzzled. The old man said flatly, "On the Time Sea, many people lose their time judgment. Although we are on the sea for only two hours, you probably feel as though your body has gone through a long passage of time. You'll be tired and that's normal. If you are, don't hesitate in resting."</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is..."</p>

  <p>The old man's words were like magic. Zheng felt his eyelids getting heavier, fighting to stay open and inevitably closing into complete darkness. He didn't even realize that he was falling asleep.</p>

  <p>Creak! Creak!</p>

  <p>Zheng didn't know how long he had slept, and he woke to the only sound of bone oars. When he opened his eyes, still in a daze, he saw nothing but giants filling the sky!</p>

  <p>"Those are the Floating Islands!"</p>

  <p>Zheng came back to himself in a flash.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Master Evil said lazily in Zheng's mind, "Well, those should be the Floating Islands of the wealthy clans. This is the first time I've actually seen them."</p>

  <p>The Floating Islands were extremely high in the sky above the Time Sea, and each of them was incomparably huge. There were no words to describe their sizes!</p>

  <p>The Floating Islands were like the Cloud Hall in the Central Region, but they were thousands of times— no, tens of thousands of times— larger.</p>

  <p>Each of them was a huge city, quietly floating in the air.</p>

  <p>These Floating Islands were not arranged in a line. Instead, they rose in spirals and extended all the way into the highest of skies.</p>

  <p>A few of the Floating Islands were so high up that they were surrounded by thick clouds. Zheng was unable to see exactly how high they reached.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we have arrived," the old man replied lightly, as though reading Zheng's mind.</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he rowed the boat to the center of the sea. In front of them was a huge disc floating in the air. Although it was hovering, it was only four feet high from the sea's surface. This disc was a public floating dock located just beneath the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>Standing at the side of the dock, Mae had arrived ahead of Zheng. Upon seeing him, she waved at him.</p>

  <p>The old man continued rowing the boat until he reached the dock. After expressing his thanks, Zheng leaped onto the dock and landed with a thud on the disc.</p>

  <p>The old man waved his hand toward Zheng and said, "If you want to come to our race's celebration on the Astronomical Transit Day, just wait for me right here when the day comes." And with that, he turned the boat around and started moving away in the opposite direction slowly.</p>

  <p>As Mae listened to this quick conversation, her bright beautiful eyes flashed a strange color and then, she stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>Her expression was confusing to Zheng. Although the woman was a top-rank True God and a senior, Zheng couldn't help but tease her, "Is there something on my face?"</p>

  <p>Mae shook her head. "Did I hear him wrong? Did he just invite you to their celebration on the Astronomical Transit Day?" she asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he did. What's wrong with that?" Zheng blinked and had no idea why Mae looked so surprised. After all, it was just a celebration in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh my God! How can that be?" Mae took a deep breath and looked at Zheng meaningfully. "I really don't know what kind of secret you're keeping. You've even been invited to participate in the celebration on the Astronomical Transit Day."</p>

  <p>As far as she knew, although there were no Holy Beings among the guests invited by the Sun Blind race, they were mostly major clan patriarchs. Even a few Demi-holy Beings would attend this famous celebration. Joy had once received an invitation as well.</p>

  <p>The Sun Blind race was a very low-key race, but they were the race that knew the most when it came to the Time Sea. The wealthy clans had been fighting with each other so many years, but they all chose to cultivate a good relationship with the Sun Blind race, and of course, they had a good reason to do so.</p>

  <p>Mae, on her behalf, was a mere top-rank True God. Although she was the closest person to Joy, she knew little about the Sun Blind race. She was very surprised that Zheng would ever be invited.</p>

  <p>"Let's go!" Noticing that Zheng still looked confused, she sighed to herself.</p>

  <p>As it stood, this time, she had made the right decision in helping her master bring Zheng back. She wondered what would happen to him once he entered the Floating Island.</p>

  <p>On the large, hovering disc where Zheng stood were also several smaller round discs, packed tightly together. After the two of them stepped onto one same small disc, which was no more than ten feet wide, the disc began to slowly rise and flew into the air.</p>

  <p>Zheng was interested in everything here. He looked around himself with his eyes wide.</p>

  <p>It wasn't long before he came close to the first Floating Island, which was also the lowest one. On the side of the Floating Island, the surname "Liu" was carved in giant letters. This island was easily a million feet high, a million feet wide, and incomparably huge!</p>

  <p>"The Liu Clan?" Zheng asked in a low voice as he noticed the word.</p>

  <p>Mae smiled at his question. If it had been any other proving godly warrior who had asked her this stupid question, she probably wouldn't have even bothered explaining a thing. She thought highly of this little guy though, so she explained patiently, "Yes. This is the Liu Clan's Floating Island. It's the weakest wealthy clan. It used to be one of the top ten wealthy clans. A huge change happened to the clan sixty divine eras ago, and it has thus fallen to this point. Today, they even face the risk of being squeezed out of the wealthy clans."</p>

  <p>Zheng nodded slightly. Even the strongest clan in the divine land wouldn't consistently remain in the front or always have the greatest advantage. In the river of time, if they didn't work hard to maintain their position, they would fall off the stage.</p>

  <p>The disc beneath their feet didn't rise fast, which gave Zheng time to look over it. There were many cities on the Floating Island, and these cities looked no smaller than the Six-Burden Divine City. That said though, the Liu Clan's Floating Island seemed to be rather old and dilapidated. More so, the entire Floating Island was covered with dust.</p>

  <p>Soon, Zheng's vision was filled with the second Floating Island.</p>

  <p>"The Xie Clan, a wealthy clan that ranks second to last. It has been one of the wealthy clans for a hundred and ten divine eras, but has always been ranked second to last. It hasn't gone up or gone down, ever," explained Mae before Zheng could utter a single question.</p>

  <p>The Xie Clan's Floating Island was completely different from the Liu Clan's. The entire island was covered in lush trees, and from the outside, Zheng couldn't even spot a single building.</p>

  <p>The disc continued moving upward.</p>

  <p>This time, Zheng found himself looking at a dark Floating Island.</p>

  <p>The Floating Island seemed to have been burned to ashes. The outside of the island was charred, like a chunk of pure black charcoal floating in the air. There was no trace of life on the island, but dead silence seemed to reign there. As for the large character carved on the outer side of the island, it was incomplete.</p>

  <p>A strange look appeared on Zheng's face. He looked at the blurry and incomplete letter and tried to distinguish it. "L? Is it the Ling Clan? Or the Lan Clan, perhaps? What happened to this Floating Island? Did someone set it on fire or something?"</p>

  <p>Mae smile. "No, neither. It's the Luo Clan. It used to be one of the top ten wealthy clans, but now, it has been destroyed. Every once in a while, the island will drop by one rank. There is no one on this island, and its ranking will keep falling. I believe that before long, it will fall directly into the Time Sea."</p>

  <p>What she said was unintentional, but the listener suddenly became more thoughtful.</p>

  <p>Zheng stiffened upon hearing her words.</p>

  <p>"The Luo Clan!"</p>

  <p>Master Evil exclaimed in Zheng's mind. "So this is supposed to be your father's Floating Island!"</p>

  <p>It was Master Evil's first time entering the Time Sea. And it was quite an eye-opener for him. Although he didn't know much about the disputes among the wealthy clans, he did know about Mike's "death." As a Holy Being, Mike had his own Floating Island in the Time Sea, but Master Evil never expected that the Luo Clan's Floating Island would be in such a state!</p>
