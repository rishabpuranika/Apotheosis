  <p>No wonder that Luo Luo Zheng and the others were confused.</p>

  <p>There was no specific cultivation method for the illusory sword intent.</p>

  <p>Some people were lucky enough to be able to comprehend the sword intent without help.</p>

  <p>Depending upon his great achievements in sword intent, Tianming could kill his opponents from any part of the world. He rarely found a worthy challenger during the All Peaks Competition. However, Luo Luo Zheng had defeated him at the All Peaks Competition. This was because like him, Luo Luo Zheng also had a thorough understanding about that sword intent, and they both mastered the consummate sword intent during the competition.</p>

  <p>Since two disciples with knowledge of consummate sword intent were seen during the All Peaks Competition, this showed that Akiba's successful sword intent meant nothing.</p>

  <p>In fact, one couldn't make great achievements in sword intent so easily.</p>

  <p>Grade two sects valued sword intent a lot. Even Cloud Hall attached great importance to cultivate disciples who understood sword intent.</p>

  <p>They encouraged disciples to learn even a bit of the sword intent. It was said that disciples who comprehended a bit of sword intent might not achieve consummate sword intent. Since learning such intents led to a higher likelihood of successful cultivation, all sects would support their members in their quest to learn sword intent.</p>

  <p>Streaks of sword intent were produced on Akiba's Dragon Sword. At this sight, Akiba forced a complacent smile as he pointed his sword tip at Tianming and said, "Unsheathe your sword, and let me take a look at your swordsmanship!"</p>

  <p>Upon hearing Akiba's words, Tianming responded with a small smile. His Blood-corroding Sword trembled a little. Likewise, sword intent hovered around his sword like cyclones. As time passed, the sword intent became more evident. The hidden sword intent had been presented in perfect shapes. In addition, streaks of thunder and lightning were emitted.</p>

  <p>This was called the Extreme Thunder Sword Intent!</p>

  <p>As Akiba saw perfect sword intent hovering over Tianming's Blood-corroding Sword, his eyes widened, and his mouth twitched. Soon, he blurted, "This, this is... perfect sword intent..."</p>

  <p>"Could I be mistaken? He is ranked third in Cloud Sect, and yet he has comprehended and mastered the perfect sword intent! Are some special thunder attributes hidden in the sword intent?"</p>

  <p>"No, that's incredible. Where did Cloud Sect find such a talented disciple?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, I am wrong. I could be mistaken. It is possible for Cloud Sect to achieve good results. But, I still cannot believe that this guy ranks third in Cloud Sect! He should be the top-ranked disciple at Cloud Sect!"</p>

  <p>Eddy was also greatly shocked. He never thought that Tianming's sword would have streaks of perfect sword intent. Since Tianming was ranked third at Cloud Sect, the disciples in the first two ranks would have inconceivable skills and strength! Where did such extraordinary men come from? How could it be possible for Cloud Sect to have so many outstanding disciples?</p>

  <p>Kenneth burst into laughter when he saw the expressions on their opponents' face. He was very satisfied with the result as it was as per his expectation.</p>

  <p>Three years ago, Evan's accident had made Kenneth the laughing stock for others. At that time, Eddy had teased him mercilessly. Today, Kenneth finally re-gained his reputation to a certain extent. Thus, he couldn't help laughing.</p>

  <p>Akiba fixated his gaze on those wisps of perfect sword intent. He was overwhelmed as complex emotions coursed through him. Then, he stated, "This perfect sword intent is not ordinary. It also exhibits certain attributes of divine thunder. If your life vitality does not condense divine thunder, then how have you integrated it into your sword intent?"</p>

  <p>Tianming didn't need to tell lies or cheat. Thus, he replied flatly, "I have comprehended consummate sword intent. I also washed my sword in the Sword Washing Pool. I then mixed the sword intent with a thunderbolt, thus contributing to the formation of the Extreme Thunder Sword Intent."</p>

  <p>"Sword Washing Pool..." Before Akiba could finish his sentence, the corner of this mouth twitched.</p>

  <p>Every swordsman dreamed of going to the sacred places for swordsmanship. This Sword Washing Pool was a rare, semi-sacred place.</p>

  <p>Since such a place was extremely rare, Akiba would be willing to wash his sword in the Sword Washing Pool even if it cost him half of his life.</p>

  <p>Akiba sighed at how lucky Tianming was, and he strongly felt that God was unfair.</p>

  <p>Tianming laughed when he noticed Akiba's reaction. He was not sure if Akiba would faint upon learning that Luo Luo Zheng had visited the Killing Sword Mountain, the sacred land for swordsmanship.</p>

  <p>"You are really awesome. You have been able to comprehend perfect sword intent at such a young age. I admire you a lot. You are also lucky to be able to cultivate sword intent at the Sword Washing Pool.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, you are behind me in terms of cultivation levels. I will still be able to defeat you even though I am no match for you in sword intent."</p>

  <p>Akiba, who had endured many mental sufferings, made a move at last.</p>

  <p>"Streaming Swordsmanship!"</p>

  <p>As he wielded his Dragon Sword, ripples continuously diffused in the sky. Akiba lunged his sword forward, forming perfect curves in the sky and giving people a strange illusion.</p>

  <p>It seemed as if he could stab Tianming to the point and defeat him by this sword move.</p>

  <p>Tianming and the audience saw that Akiba's sword was aimed at Tianming.</p>

  <p>Tianming's mind was affected for a short period. However, when a tiny streak of thunder and lightning flashed before his eyes, Tianming's mind became clear as before.</p>

  <p>"The Streaming Swordsmanship takes advantage of the characteristics of flowing water so that people will believe that what they see or hear is true. This is really awesome, but... your sword can't compare with my Heavenly Sword!"</p>

  <p>After Akiba's attack, Tianming took a Sword Step by dodging left and right.</p>

  <p>"Sword Step... This guy has mastered it as well," mumbled Akiba.</p>

  <p>Seeing that Tianming had easily escaped from his Streaming Swordsmanship, Akiba became more agitated. He now truly believed that God seemed to have blessed Tianming unfairly.</p>
