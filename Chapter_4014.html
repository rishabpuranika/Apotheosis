<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A flash of passion was quickly revealed in everyone's eyes.</p>

  <p>However, they had just arrived at this completely strange place. They must be careful about possible powerful restrictions in the stone pillars. They couldn't be rash, so they decided that it wasn't the time to make drastic moves.</p>

  <p>After they sized the stone pillars up for a while, their gazes fell once again on Zheng.</p>

  <p>He was still standing like a statue with a spear in his hand.</p>

  <p>At the same time, they perceived that the aura of the Treacherous Being in Zheng's body was gradually becoming weaker. It meant that the uncomfortable sensation that they were feeling was being slowly alleviated.</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Being's aura has weakened a lot. Can you drive it out from his body now?" The Snake Goddess turned and asked the leader of the black-robed men straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>"I also think that this is the perfect opportunity to do it," the leader affirmed.</p>

  <p>He then turned to his men, selected two from them, and quickly went to Zheng's location.</p>

  <p>The two black-robed men stood on Zheng's sides. Each of them took out a small black mirror and began chanting some indistinguishable words.</p>

  <p>Immediately after, black light shot out from both mirrors.</p>

  <p>When the Snake Goddess and the others saw the black light, they instantly raised their eyebrows, knowing that it was the Dark Region.</p>

  <p>It was known that nothing in the Dark Region could be brought into the Light Region. If they were brought and entered the Light Region, these things would quickly melt like ice sculptures placed under the scorching sun.</p>

  <p>Then, the leader of the black-robed men walked towards the black light. As the leader was completely enveloped with the light, he raised his left hand and gently patted his wrist with his other hand. At the same time, he whispered, "Come out, little fellow. Don't be afraid. It's safe here."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, a small gecko emerged from the sleeve of his robe.</p>

  <p>The gecko's body was completely dark, but its eyes were brightly shining with a golden light. It stayed at the leader's palm as it spat out a dark-red tongue.</p>

  <p>The two small mirrors reflected the Dark Region. People from outside the region wouldn't be able to see the gecko's body, but its two golden eyes would be perceived as two golden dots in the darkness.</p>

  <p>When all their preparations were ready, the leader of the black-robed men ordered, "Give him a Darkness Fruit."</p>

  <p>The gecko was a very fragile creature, and it was only suited for the Dark Region. Since it could only stay in the Dark Region, Zheng had to be the one to enter it. Because of that, he needed a Darkness Fruit.</p>

  <p>However, when one of the black-robed men beside Zheng was about to take out the Darkness Fruit, the Snake Goddess informed their leader, "Zheng is the ruler of Stage Thirteen. You should not worry about the erosion caused by the Dark Region."</p>

  <p>"Ruler of Stage Thirteen?" The leader of the black-robed men was surprised as he looked at Zheng.</p>

  <p>As far as he knew, the stage rulers were all creatures on the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>That was why he couldn't believe that Zheng was actually a ruler of one of the stages.</p>

  <p>"Well, don't bother then," the leader of the black-robed men said as he waved his hand. He then gestured his subordinates to aim the small mirrors directly at Zheng. As the black light enveloped Zheng, the leader approached Zheng's body and put the black gecko beside his ear.</p>

  <p>The gecko seemed to have immediately sensed something and jumped onto Zheng's head. Then it drilled its long tail into his ear.</p>

  <p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>

  <p>The golden light in the gecko's eyes continuously flickered. Then, the light passed along its back, all the way to its tail, and went inside Zheng's body through his ear.</p>

  <p>Despite the gecko's fragile physique, it could actually exorcise all kinds of evil spirits.</p>

  <p>However, the Treacherous Being couldn't be simply defined as a soul, so there was no assurance that the gecko's light would be effective. But the moment the light entered Zheng's body, the Treacherous Being acted up. It was disgusted with the golden light, so the light could drive it away.</p>

  <p>The leader of the black-robed men knew how powerful the Treacherous Being was. So in order for the gecko's power to succeed, he waited until the Treacherous Being's will was extremely weakened.</p>

  <p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>

  <p>A few moments after the golden light entered Zheng's body, his eyes started to flicker with the same light.</p>

  <p>When the leader of the black-robed men saw the golden light in Zheng's eyes, he was kind of relieved. He believed that they were on the process of successfully driving the Treacherous Being out of Zheng's body.</p>

  <p>After a short while, Zheng's body slightly trembled and his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>The leader approached Zheng's body and let the gecko jump back into his sleeve.</p>

  <p>Then, the two subordinates gradually removed the Dark Region, and retreated beside their leader.</p>

  <p>Everyone was expectant as they stared at Zheng.</p>

  <p>After a few seconds, his eyelids trembled and his eyes opened slowly.</p>

  <p>His eyes went back to normal, and they were abnormally calm.</p>

  <p>"Did it work?"</p>

  <p>Eastern Emperor Taiyi and the others were already cheering for Zheng's return.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng was strangely quiet. He just looked at the crowd with an emotionless face. It was as if his eyes were looking at inanimate objects.</p>

  <p>Immediately noticing that something was still amiss, Fuxi asked, "Zheng, is that already you?"</p>

  <p>Then Zheng frowned and whined, "Waah? Waah?"</p>

  <p>The sounds he produced were kind of deep but not aggressive.</p>

  <p>However, everyone instantly realized that this was not Zheng, but still the Treacherous Being.</p>

  <p>"What happened? I thought it would work?" Fuxi asked the leader of the black-robed men in a frustrated tone.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. This is the first time that it failed. The Treacherous Being should have left by now." The leader couldn't also believe that Zheng's body was still possessed.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, are you there? Can you respond to me?" Eastern Emperor Taiyi tried to communicate with him through his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Although Zheng wasn't able to control his physical body right now, his soul should remain in his mind, so he should still be able to communicate through his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>However, there was no response even from his soul.</p>

  <p>Everyone present looked at each other with anxious eyes. Their problem remained unsolved, and there was a possibility that it became even worse.</p>

  <p>While they were still at a loss, the Wing King suddenly said, "We have to go now."</p>

  <p>"Why? What do you mean?" the Snake Goddess asked. "We're in a bad situation right now.</p>

  <p>Zheng sent me a message through the Civilization Artifact. He said that the sounds his body just made were warnings from the Treacherous Being," the Wing King explained.</p>

  <p>"Warnings? About what? And why can't he communicate with his soul?" the Snake Goddess asked again as everything was unclear at the moment.</p>

  <p>"The Treacherous Being has truly awakened, and it has imprisoned Zheng's soul. That's why he wasn't able to answer through his spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>He has instructed me to let all of you know that this place would be very dangerous. So, we have to get out of here as soon as possible," the Wing King explained further.</p>

  <p>After the Heavenly Obsession Civilization deciphered the Treacherous Being's words, Zheng immediately asked the Regal Jade Spirit to deliver his message to the Wing King through the Civilization Artifact.</p>

  <p>"Then we have no choice. We have to go now," Peterson said with a frown.</p>

  <p>"So that means we have to leave Zheng here alone?" the Snake Goddess asked, letting out a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>No one answered as they knew how the Snake Goddess felt about abandoning Zheng in his current state.</p>

  <p>And while everyone was still hesitating to leave, a sound of bones crushing suddenly resounded from a distance.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at the direction where the disturbing sounds were coming from. Then, they saw a monster with a big head and a small body emerge from the darkness.</p>

  <p>Upon closer inspection, they saw that the monster was chewing something.</p>

  <p>A pair of legs hung from its mouth, and they were shocked to notice that the clothes of the person being chewed matched the clothes of the black-robed men.</p>

  <p>"W-what kind of monster is that?"</p>

  <p>"Is it eating one of our men?!"</p>

  <p>"There's indeed someone missing!"</p>

  <p>The black-robed men were standing farther at the back, so they didn't notice that one of them had been already missing.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. One more person is missing. Where is Brock?" a black-robed man said as he finished with the headcount.</p>

  <p>Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>

  <p>On the other side of the crowd, another big-headed monster emerged from the dark. They also saw a man's body hanging from its mouth, and he must be Brock.</p>

  <p>When the Night Being race's special robes were broken, their bodies were quickly eroded in the Light Region. However, the speed at which their bodies were eroded was far slower than the rate at which the monsters chewed their prey.</p>
