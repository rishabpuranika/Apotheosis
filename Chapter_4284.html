<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 4284 The In And Out Holes </b></h2>
<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched warily as the white hole formed rapidly, the needle drilling out from within it.</p>

  <p>The needle itself still continued to extend at incredible speed.</p>

  <p>The distance between the Burial Land and the Source World was not too big, and the needle steadily approached the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>From the jadeite platform, Luo Zheng projected this shocking scene, so that everyone could see it.</p>

  <p>"Is this a space channel?" Kendrick asked, his eyes widening with shock.</p>

  <p>Everyone could tell that the black hole and the white hole were two ends of a space channel.</p>

  <p>It was relatively simple to construct a space channel, but it definitely was no easy feat to build a space channel big enough for the needle to pass through. This space channel was so large that it could fit the entire Source World!</p>

  <p>"They are the In and Out Holes built from the Hyperspace Extreme Form," Luo Zheng explained calmly.</p>

  <p>The black hole swallowed everything in its path, whereas the white hole served as the exit for everything that entered the black hole.</p>

  <p>Once the needle entered through the black hole, there was nowhere else for it to go but the exit through white hole.</p>

  <p>"What an incredible method!" the Snake Goddess praised, beaming with awe.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how the downgrader will deal with this. The needle is moving so fast!" Kincaid said excitedly.</p>

  <p>The Evil God had built the In and Out Holes right in the nick of time, and the needle was now approaching the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>It would've been fine if the downgrader had prepared in advance. But now, since it was so sudden, it was difficult for him to change the direction of the needle.</p>

  <p>Three hundred miles.</p>

  <p>One hundred miles.</p>

  <p>Ten miles.</p>

  <p>One mile.</p>

  <p>The needle was so close to piercing the Burial Land...</p>

  <p>Suddenly, the needle abruptly stopped in its path. It was as though a giant hand had grabbed it with force.</p>

  <p>In the Burial Land, the plate in front of the downgrader had turned a dark red. In the face of danger, he had chosen to forcefully stop the needle. A trace of anger was revealed in his six pairs of eyes; he never expected that the Evil God would master the Hyperspace Extreme Form, much less that he would fall into such a trap.</p>

  <p>The Burial Land had almost been destroyed just now.</p>

  <p>Everyone on the jadeite platform was shocked at the turn of events.</p>

  <p>"Why did the needle stop?"</p>

  <p>"The needle isn't long enough to reach the Burial Land?"</p>

  <p>"No," the Snake Goddess said, her eyes growing misty. "The needle is controlled by the downgrader, and the Source World is the first target chosen by him."</p>

  <p>The other people exchanged surprised glances. What the Snake Goddess said was logical.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, from the sentry Evil God's perspective, his eyes almost popped out of his head when he saw what happened.</p>

  <p>His real self's expression darkened. He immediately arrived at the same conclusion as the Snake Goddess. "So it's true. The needle is really controlled by the downgrader! I won't stand for this!"</p>

  <p>Since the needle stopped in its tracks, it just stood still, a mile away from the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>After a while, a black dot appeared on the surface of the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>Quickly, it grew to be a large black hole.</p>

  <p>In a matter of seconds, a black hole had been built by the downgrader by using the Hyperspace Extreme Form. After he had created the hole, he did something to the plate in front of him, and the red color that lingered on the plate disappeared. The needle once again began to move forward.</p>

  <p>Swoosh!</p>

  <p>Using the exact same technique, the downgrader turned the tables on them. As the huge needle plunged into the black hole, another white hole appeared above the Source World. Once more, the needle was steadily advancing towards the Source World!</p>

  <p>The needle had ended many rounds of chaos, and every time it could do that in an instant.</p>

  <p>No matter how powerful an Other Shore Token was, no one could change the needle's course.</p>

  <p>By now, the direction of the needle had been changed four times in a row.</p>

  <p>Yet, it continued to plough forward through the distorted space.</p>

  <p>As he watched the needle rush towards the Source World, the Evil God found that he no longer felt indignant. Instead, he felt quite excited.</p>

  <p>He figured that the downgrader viewed him as insignificant, since he dared attack his Source World first. With a sinister smile, the Evil God vowed he would make the downgrader regret choosing him as a target.</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>As he waved his hand slightly, the Hyperspace Extreme Form was activated once more.</p>

  <p>The power of the Deep Space was incredible, but it consumed too much energy each time.</p>

  <p>Building a set of In and Out Holes for the needle was extremely taxing to the Evil God, since he needed to continuously draw power from the Source World.</p>

  <p>But now that he was in high spirits, he no longer cared about how much it cost.</p>

  <p>A new set of In and Out Holes appeared. The black hole and the white hole appeared at the same time, sending the needle back.</p>

  <p>Soon, the third set of holes appeared.</p>

  <p>Once more, the needle was heading towards the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>Seeing the needle being sent back again, the downgrader sneered. He saw the Evil God's message loud and clear? he was being challenged.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how much Extreme Form energy you have mastered, but is the energy of the Source World enough to defeat me?</p>

  <p>I'll just keep returning the needle to you!"</p>

  <p>Buzz!</p>

  <p>The downgrader built yet another set of holes, reverting the course of the needle back to the Source World.</p>

  <p>The downgrader smiled confidently. Since the Evil God built several holes in such a short time, he figured the energy of the Source World would be depleted rapidly. Ultimately, once the energy was used up, it would collapse.</p>

  <p>The downgrader was so sure of this, so he chose to deal with the Source World first.</p>

  <p>In comparison, Luo Zheng was much more difficult to deal with, because his ancestry-level bloodline could provide endless energy.</p>

  <p>Seeing that the needle was sent back again, the Evil God frowned slightly.</p>

  <p>Turning around, he stared at the primitive land floating nearby.</p>

  <p>"Luo Zheng, you idle fool. Don't just watch the battle from afar. Come help me!"</p>

  <p>Once he'd finished speaking, the Evil God abruptly whipped around to build the fifth set of holes.</p>

  <p>Once again, the black hole swallowed the needle, but this time, its white hole was facing Luo Zheng's primitive land!</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on the jadeite platform, everyone had been focused on the movements of the needle.</p>

  <p>The needle that had changed its direction so many times in a row looked like a big snake that was coiling around the space. Seeing such a huge thing moving rapidly, everyone was both anxious yet transfixed.</p>

  <p>This was the needle that would end the chaos!</p>

  <p>It was a terrible weapon that had annihilated over a thousand civilizations.</p>

  <p>However, now it was being practically toyed with by the Evil God and the downgrader!</p>

  <p>"Ah, the white hole!"</p>

  <p>Geoffrey cried when he saw the white hole appear facing his father's primitive land.</p>

  <p>Everyone wore a nervous expression as they eyed the needle steadily approaching.</p>

  <p>If it wasn't stopped, the needle would crash into the primitive land in a matter of seconds, crushing the Li Shan mountain, the Ruin Graveyard, and the other places.</p>

  <p>"Of course, the Evil God wants us involved," Luo Zheng said, as though he had been expecting this.</p>

  <p>The Evil God knew perfectly well where Luo Zheng's position was, so he had shifted the needle's target to his primitive land.</p>

  <p>However, Luo Zheng was well prepared, so he didn't panic. As he pointed a finger to the skies, an avatar slowly floated up. A ball of energy floated above his head; it was the Hyperspace Extreme Form.</p>

  <p>The sixth set of holes were created by Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>As usual, the black hole swallowed the needle in one gulp, but Luo Zheng didn't return it to the Evil God. Instead, the white hole faced the Burial Land.</p>

  <p>Once again, the massive needle was charging towards the downgrader.</p>
