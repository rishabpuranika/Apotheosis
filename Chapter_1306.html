  <p>In fact, both of them had never seen a life vitality jade before.</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Force Sacred Place did not treat the warriors who flew to the Upper World very well. They just set up an enchanted barrier around the mine and threw the warriors in, treating them like locked up prisoners.</p>

  <p>If the warriors wanted to get out, they had to hand over one hundred life vitality jades. It was no different from robbing them.</p>

  <p>The only good thing about it was that it made the warriors from the Lower World stop longing for the Upper World. It made them realize how helpless the Soul Sea Realm warriors would be once they ascended to the Upper World.</p>

  <p>The stones were exuding with life vitality, so they were most likely to be life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>However, it was not easy to take away the life vitality jades, which were placed not far away from a twelfth-level fierce beast.</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng's current strength, he could fight a Soul Sea Realm master.</p>

  <p>However, this twelfth-level fierce beast was equivalent to a Spirit Supreme Realm master, and the lifespan of a beast was often longer than those of humans. Besides, the Nine-head Snake was probably regarded as a legendary beast, so even if Luo Luo Zheng fought it, he could not defeat it.</p>

  <p>As for Freya, she had only just broken through to the Soul Sea Realm.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she thought that she was stronger than Luo Luo Zheng, but Luo Luo Zheng didn't think much of it.</p>

  <p>The two of them stared at the cluster of life vitality jades as they observed the sleeping Nine-head Snake. They were hesitant about reaching out to get the life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>Still, they did not want to give up. However, they were afraid that they would risk their lives if they tried to take away the jades.</p>

  <p>At the moment, Freya smiled faintly. "I have a hidden treasure and with its help I can hide most of my breath. This Nine-head Snake is still sleeping. I should go and steal those life vitality jades."</p>

  <p>Hearing Freya's words, Luo Luo Zheng did not utter a word. It would be good if she could successfully take them away. There was great risk in it, but the benefits they would reap were not small. Therefore, he nodded solemnly.</p>

  <p>Freya took out a light green muslin robe. The robe was as thin as a cicada's wing. As Freya casually put it on her body, Luo Zheng's face betrayed a trace of surprise.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it was just as Freya had described. Once her body was covered in the muslin robe, a large portion of her breath was concealed. Even with Luo Zheng's incomparably keen sense of perception, it would have been difficult for him to detect her existence if he had not been paying attention to her. Of course he could not sense her through his perception, but if he observed with his eyes, he could see the noticeable green hue.</p>

  <p>However, the purpose of this kind of magic treasure was to conceal the breath. Moreover, this Nine-head Snake was still sleeping. Since she was able to conceal the breath, the muslin robe was suitable for this current dilemma.</p>

  <p>'Judging from its use, this magic treasure could be considered a divine weapon, ' Luo Luo Zheng thought to himself.</p>

  <p>Freya blinked at Luo Luo Zheng, and after nodding, she walked toward the Nine-head Snake.</p>

  <p>Although she tried her best to suppress her emotions and keep calm, Luo Luo Zheng could still see that she was very nervous. He wanted her to give him the robe so that he could go and fetch the life vitality jades himself, but after seeing that she had already taken a few steps forward, he gave up on that idea.</p>

  <p>Freya's nervousness was inevitable. She came from a prestigious clan, but after ascending to the Upper World, everything had been different from how she had imagined it.</p>

  <p>She had thought that her own uncle would come and pick her up. Then she would join the Spiritual Force Sacred Place to continue her cultivation...</p>

  <p>However, ever since she had ascended to the Upper World, not only did she not meet her uncle, but she took such risks in exchange for her freedom. She was still a Soul Sea Realm warrior, so she had the courage, perseverance and willpower of the same. She decided she would not be flustered and helpless like a weak young lady whenever she got into trouble.</p>

  <p>The Nine-head Snake might have been sleeping in this place for countless years. Vicious beasts tended to sleep for a relatively long time.</p>

  <p>Before it could advance to a higher level, it would often sleep for hundreds of years, even a thousand. Snakes even had the habit of hibernating.</p>

  <p>'This thing won't wake up...'</p>

  <p>Freya kept comforting herself silently. At the same time, she moved toward the life vitality jades with light footsteps.</p>

  <p>With her cultivation base, she could control almost every inch of her meridians and muscles with incomparable coordination. Thus, from beginning to end, she was like a nimble cat as she walked toward the treasure.</p>

  <p>At this time, another voice came from the above.</p>

  <p>"Amritpal, I'm not hiding from you. Once I've mastered the Energy Returning Incarnation, you can obediently wait for death in the Autumn Mountain World!"</p>

  <p>This voice was like thunder as it traveled through a hundred thousand supreme worlds and spread through the universe. The voice could still be heard clearly in the deepest parts of the earth and in the deepest depths of the oceans. Every warrior and every living being could hear it.</p>

  <p>This was how overbearing the Roaring Token was...</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng and Freya could hear it, and the sleeping Nine-head Snake could also hear it.</p>

  <p>"Heh..."</p>

  <p>However, since the snake had been asleep for far too many years already, it could not be woken up by the voice. It just turned one of its heads over, let out a moan, and then fell asleep again.</p>

  <p>Freya was very nervous at first. When she suddenly heard the sound, she got even more nervous, her heart racing twofold. As she saw one of the Nine-head Snake's heads move, her body trembled. Her originally nimble steps became disorderly. One of her feet landed on a palm-sized rock. As the rock rolled, there was a loud rumble.</p>

  <p>The sound echoed clearly in the cave.</p>

  <p>Freya's entire body froze on the spot, and so did Luo Luo Zheng. At this moment, both of them seemed to stop breathing.</p>

  <p>"Heh, heh..."</p>

  <p>When two snake heads heard the sound, they slightly raised themselves as if trying to figure out the source of it. Fortunately, they did not open their eyes. Perhaps they were too tired. The two heads lay down on the floor again.</p>

  <p>Up until that moment, Freya felt that she was going to get herself killed, but after seeing the Nine-head Snake's reaction, she let out a long, deep breath and turned around to smile at Luo Luo Zheng before continuing to walk toward the life vitality jades...</p>

  <p>Once Freya successfully approached the cluster of life vitality jades, her eyes emitted a ray of light.</p>

  <p>With a casual glance, she determined that there were thirty-nine life vitality jades hidden there. She didn't know what the life vitality jades were. They could clearly be considered ores, but each of them was like the 'fruit' of a plant which grew here.</p>

  <p>Freya reached out and was about to pick the fruits one by one.</p>

  <p>But as she went to grab the life vitality jade, she was astonished when her complexion changed suddenly. She was unable to take out the life vitality jade!</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng, who had been observing from afar, also frowned. Freya was a Soul Sea Realm master and for a woman, her strength was great. How could she not pick the life vitality jade?</p>

  <p>Freya gently circulated her strength. This time, she used thirty percent of it, but the jade in her hand did not move at all, nor did the milky white branch, as if the pair of them were made of steel and inlaid there.</p>

  <p>Even if it was an iron tree, it should not be able to withstand Freya's tugging. It seemed to her that it would not be so easy to take away the life vitality jades.</p>

  <p>Freya took another deep breath. This time, she used sixty percent of her strength, but the life vitality jade still did not move at all...</p>

  <p>Finally, she tried to make use of ninety percent of her strength.</p>

  <p>Freya's face was red with anger, but the life vitality jade was still hanging onto the branch.</p>

  <p>At this time, she understood that she would not be able to pick it with just her strength alone.</p>

  <p>She turned her head and looked at Luo Luo Zheng helplessly. She could only give up and return to his side.</p>

  <p>"I can't take it down..." Freya's face revealed a trace of anger. She had just been about to succeed, but then she discovered that she could not pick the life vitality jade after all. Naturally, she felt dejected and disappointed.</p>

  <p>The Spiritual Force Sacred Place was the one to blame for all of this. If there was a shortage of life vitality jades there, they would send Spirit Supreme Realm masters to dig for the life vitality jades in the various mines of the sacred place. Usually, because of their abundant reserves, the Spirit Supreme Realm warriors could not be bothered to take action.</p>

  <p>Besides, if they went out to look for the life vitality jades, it would not only take them a lot of time, but also pose them great risks.</p>

  <p>If one wanted to obtain life vitality jades, they would usually make use of some kind of a tool to dig them out. It had to at least be a divine weapon!</p>

  <p>The life vitality jade had absorbed a vast amount of vitality between heaven and earth before slowly being created from the grounds. How could it be so easy to pluck it out?</p>
