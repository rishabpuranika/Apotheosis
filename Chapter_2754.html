<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 2754 The Truth </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>The consummate True Gods were also unwilling to give up.</p>

  <p>But they had no choice but to step down as their elders had given the order.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Luo Zheng was far more powerful than them and they were no match for him.</p>

  <p>In the end, Rachelle had no choice but to go back.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>A purple fire sword streaked across the black water and shot towards Luo Zheng explosively.</p>

  <p>Liusu was launching consecutive attacks on him.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng twisted his body abruptly but the purple fire sword still followed his movements.</p>

  <p>As he lifted his body upwards, the purple fire sword brushed across the black water as it lost its target.</p>

  <p>As the unearthly purple fire touched the black water, it immediately went out and disappeared.</p>

  <p>"The black water..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng watched the scene unfolding in front of his eyes and grew more cautious.</p>

  <p>He knew perfectly well how deadly the unearthly purple fire from Liusu was. It could burn almost everything.</p>

  <p>Especially after Liusu's cultivation base had improved greatly, it could not only burn the Nine-head Snake, but even light up the lava sea in the Abyss Demon Region.</p>

  <p>But yet it got put out after touching the black water.</p>

  <p>What was that black water? How could it put out the fire?</p>

  <p>Just as Luo Zheng was considering the question, a cold voice rang from behind him. "You have been to the Reincarnation Land, haven't you?" asked Liusu.</p>

  <p>As Liusu, Aleyna and Pascal had combined as one, they could fly faster than Luo Zheng, and the distance between them and Luo Zheng was gradually shortened.</p>

  <p>"Yes. So what?" Luo Zheng replied coolly.</p>

  <p>"What did you see in the Reincarnation Land?" asked Liusu.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng turned his head and looked indifferently at Liusu who was not far away. "Why should I tell you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh?"</p>

  <p>Liusu's face hardened with a trace of coldness and she pinched her fingers together slightly.</p>

  <p>Next to her, Aleyna and Pascal activated the huge array in the center at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Whirl!"</p>

  <p>The unearthly purple fire branched out like vines in the air and turned into a large purple fire array which shrouded Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's instinct was to dodge, but it happened too fast for him to do anything.</p>

  <p>"Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!"</p>

  <p>With Luo Zheng trapped, Liusu, Aleyna and Pascal separated from each other and stood on the three important positions of the purple fire array.</p>

  <p>"Even top-level Demi-holy Beings can't get out of this Dragon Trapping Array with my preternatural purple fire," Liusu sneered. "Now you have plenty of time to tell me."</p>

  <p>The preternatural purple fire from Liusu was so powerful that even Holy Beings had to dodge once it burned.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt or denying that the three of them could use this preternatural purple fire array to trap Holy Beings.</p>

  <p>The most important aspect of the Dragon Trapping Array was to lock up the space. Once the top-level Demi-holy Beings were trapped in it, they could not make use of the Grand Teleportation technique. Furthermore, the Grand Teleportation technique was forbidden in the Abyss Demon Region, which was to their advantage.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng stood still in the middle of the Dragon Trapping Array and remained calm. He examined the fire array closely and asked, "Is this Dragon Trapping Array created by Samuel? I have to say that it is really exquisite."</p>

  <p>"Yes. So what?" There was a hint of pride on Liusu's face.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng looked directly at Liusu and continued, "You have controlled the three of them, so they can make such a mysterious array. And the person behind all this is you, Samuel. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Liusu glared at Luo Zheng and said, "It has nothing to do with you."</p>

  <p>"You have been a Holy Being for two lifetimes. You are a person with great luck. The divine land treats you well. But is it really worthwhile to sacrifice your children just for the sake of vengeance? Think about it," Luo Zheng said.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Liusu's face darkened at his words.</p>

  <p>"Do I need to spell it out for you? Holy Gregorio?" Luo Zheng couldn't help blurting out the truth.</p>

  <p>What he said greatly stunned Liusu, Aleyna, Pascal and Samuel on the Desperation Plain. They all wore exactly the same expressions of shock.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's other deductions didn't matter at all to Samuel.</p>

  <p>After all, people often wondered how his three children became consummate True Gods, but he didn't bother to explain to them.</p>

  <p>But Luo Zheng had revealed his biggest secret. There was nothing he feared more than someone finding out his secret.</p>

  <p>More than twenty years ago, he had regained his memories from his previous life. He had been trying to approach Nicholas since then.</p>

  <p>However, Nicholas was very alert to the Han Clan, so he had never had a good chance.</p>

  <p>He was determined to find a good time to take actions on this trip to the Abyss Demon Region. He was going to destroy the whole Dongfang Clan and even the whole union of the powerful clans on the Floating Islands.</p>

  <p>But if Nicholas found out his true identity, the consequences were hugely undesirable.</p>

  <p>"How did you know that? Did the Stone Mouse tell you?" Liusu asked sullenly.</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng replied with a shrug, "Yes, and no. It just told me its owner was Gregorio. I managed to figure out everything else by following Gregorio's memories."</p>

  <p>"So that's how it is." Liusu nodded slightly. A faint smile appeared on her gloomy face. "It really comes as a big surprise to learn that you have found out my identity, but unfortunately you'll have no chance to tell others about it. Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>As soon as she finished her words, the purple flames roared in the Dragon Trapping Array around Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>Samuel was determined to kill Luo Zheng inside the array.</p>

  <p>Staring at the blazing flames, Luo Zheng shook his head slightly and said, "It seems that you don't care much about Liusu."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Liusu frowned and asked.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't Liusu told you that her purple fire can burn everything except me?" Luo Zheng smirked.</p>

  <p>"Don't be stubborn!"</p>

  <p>Samuel refused to believe his words. On the Desperation Plain, he ordered Liusu to activate the Dragon Trapping Array.</p>

  <p>The flames from all directions swarmed towards Luo Zheng, completely engulfing him and burning crazily.</p>

  <p>Even Holy Beings found it troublesome to deal with the unearthly purple fire condensed by Liusu. Luo Zheng, however, was only at the consummation of True God Realm.</p>

  <p>"Splash..."</p>

  <p>Luo Zheng's body drifted slowly in the unearthly purple fire. When he came out, he was unharmed.</p>

  <p>His body was shining with golden light, making him look like a Buddha statue plated with a layer of gold foil.</p>

  <p>Despite being in two different locations, Samuel on the Desperation Plain and Liusu standing right opposite Luo Zheng, both had the same reaction, which was to stare with wide eyes. They were dumbstruck by the impossible scene.</p>

  <p>Only then did Samuel vaguely remember that Alfredo had once reported to him that Luo Zheng seemed to have a body that was unaffected by fire, but he hadn't taken it seriously as Luo Zheng was merely a low-rank True God at that time.</p>

  <p>He had chosen to control Liusu, Aleyna and Pascal because Liusu had the unearthly purple fire.</p>

  <p>He had made use of the power given to him by the Stone Mouse to urge the three of them to reach the consummation of True God Realm. After that, they could even kill the top-level Demi-holy Beings if they worked together with the help of Liusu's unearthly purple fire.</p>

  <p>But now they met this man who was unaffected by the unearthly purple fire at all, and their biggest advantage was gone.</p>

  <p>"Swish!"</p>

  <p>After rushing out the purple fire, Luo Zheng went straight to Liusu.</p>

  <p>Liusu reacted quickly and only took a step back, while Pascal and Aleyna took a step further. The three of them used the Dragon Trapping Array to fight against Luo Zheng.</p>

  <p>However, what made their array so powerful was the purple fire. Since it didn't work on Luo Zheng, they could do nothing to trap him.</p>
