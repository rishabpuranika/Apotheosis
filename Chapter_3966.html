<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>Shoes roughly scraped off the ground, as Zheng and his group continued to head north of the Flaming Maple Forest. The leaves of the Flaming Maple Trees on both sides glowed green along their way and emitted a soft, friendly aura.</p>

  <p>When they got out of the Flaming Maple Forest, the branches even waved goodbye to Zheng even if there was no wind.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you're the first one to get this treatment," said King Ieuan beside him.</p>

  <p>It dragged a hill-like package behind it, wrapped up in a patched-up skin of a tamed cat. It was not convenient to use the space ring in the Flaming Maple Forest, so it had to use such a primitive method to carry their things.</p>

  <p>"I'm also sure that the Flaming Maple Forest never wants you to come back," Fuxi chimed in.</p>

  <p>In general, Zheng was perhaps one of the few people who could safely walk out of the Flaming Maple Forest, even though he had used energy within it.</p>

  <p>There used to be some particularly special cases, but none of them was the same as his.</p>

  <p>He looked back at the Flaming Maple Forest and asked, "If we head west and go upwards along the Divine River, can we enter the Supreme Pure Realm and the Jade Pure Realm?"</p>

  <p>A smile graced King Ieuan's lips at the question.</p>

  <p>"Of course not!" it answered. "Why?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>Theoretically speaking, one could reach the Jade Pure Realm by walking along the Divine River since the source of the Divine River was in the Jade Pure Realm.</p>

  <p>King Ieuan pointed at the west and said, "It seems that this direction will lead us to the Supreme Pure Realm, but that is only true in theory. We speculated that the Three Purities Stage was originally made up of three independent worlds.</p>

  <p>However, these three worlds are connected through a precise dislocation of space." "Then, I suppose there are very few entrances, and they are similar to the star rings and the Stage End Passage?" Zheng asked again. "No," the Snake Goddess answered.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, there are many entrances, but very few can walk through them alive..." she explained.</p>

  <p>Most of the warriors at the Eternal Realm who entered Stage Thirty-three stayed in the Grand Pure Realm, which was in the outermost part of the Three Purities Stage. Very few of them had gone into the Supreme Pure Realm. Simply put, it was truly hard to enter the Supreme Pure Realm successfully.</p>

  <p>"But we already have a way to enter it. You don't have to worry about that," said Fuxi as he untied the bag on his waist. Then, the Augury Dog came out from the bag.</p>

  <p>The Augury Dog's talent lay in his ability to detect danger in his surroundings. He could do so by scanning the area using a special energy field, which would activate the maple leaves in the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>However, he could not stop once he started to detect things. Therefore, Fuxi had put him inside his spirit beast bag before they entered the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>Like the Sumeru Space, the spirit beast bag wouldn't trigger the power of space as long as it was not used in the Flaming Maple Forest.</p>

  <p>As soon as Fuxi released the Augury Dog, he turned around and barked twice at the Flaming Maple Forest. "What's wrong?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Ever since Zheng exhibited his powers in the Flaming Maple Forest, no one dared to chase after him and cause him trouble.</p>

  <p>"Someone is following us," the Augury Dog said.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing those words, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, Yasamin, and the others all narrowed their eyes.</p>

  <p>Zheng had finally solved the problem in the Flaming Maple Forest. They just had to deal with the package first, then find a safe place to retreat from the Other Shore.</p>

  <p>Still, if someone with ill will always followed them, everything would be more complicated.</p>

  <p>After all, it was easy to find a member of the Gear race, like Norris. If someone dragged them back to the Other Shore from the chaos, they would be attacked off guard.</p>

  <p>"Let's lure them out of the Flaming Maple Forest first," the Snake Goddess suggested.</p>

  <p>In turn, King Ieuan hurriedly unwrapped the package while these Eternal Realm warriors activated their own Sumeru Spaces to absorb the things inside the package.</p>

  <p>After they divided up all the things inside it, they continued to walk north.</p>

  <p>As they advanced, King Ieuan flicked the ground constantly.</p>

  <p>They suddenly stopped after about twenty miles of travel. King Ieuan turned around and shouted, "Let's see how you can hide!"</p>

  <p>As it spoke, it stretched out its hands and quickly raised them.</p>

  <p>Multiple cyan beads that glowed with a faint cyan light appeared on the ground in the distance. Although the light was dim, it illuminated the area within a few miles around it.</p>

  <p>Then, the outlines of two winged figures became visible in the cyan light.</p>

  <p>"Humph!"</p>

  <p>Without any hesitation, Zheng kicked hard at the ground.</p>

  <p>The earth cracked, then he flew swiftly like an arrow and grabbed at the figures with lightning speed.</p>

  <p>However, his hands only passed through the two figures, and he grabbed nothing.</p>

  <p>He even heard the pair of shadows sneer at him as if mocking his ignorance.</p>

  <p>"Zheng, come down. You can't hurt them," Eastern Emperor Taiyi said.</p>

  <p>In the end, Zheng only frowned and slowly descended to the ground.</p>

  <p>"They are Shadow Warriors who serve the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>Their real bodies are not here," said the Snake Goddess.</p>

  <p>The Shadow Warriors weren't very strong, but their race's theurgy produced a shadow that was resistant to almost anything, which made them the perfect stalkers.</p>

  <p>If the Element Spirit Civilization needed to track specific targets, they would just send out the Shadow Warriors.</p>

  <p>"It appears that they won't let us return to the Source World so easily,"</p>

  <p>Yasamin scoffed coldly. "So we can't get rid of them?" Zheng asked.</p>

  <p>"It's difficult," the Snake Goddess said and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Could they possibly enter the Dark Region?" he asked again. The Snake Goddess immediately understood what he meant and said, "The Shadow Warriors shouldn't be able to enter the Dark Region, but the Dark Region of the Grand Pure Realm is in the northwest.</p>

  <p>I'm afraid..."</p>

  <p>Since the Element Spirit Civilization had sent out the Shadow Warriors to keep an eye on them, they wouldn't possibly let them escape that easily.</p>

  <p>"Then, let's try. Masters, please climb up on my shoulders first!" Zheng announced.</p>

  <p>He crouched down to let them ride on his broad shoulders, since his body was still about eighty feet tall.</p>

  <p>Fuxi, the Snake Goddess, Eastern Emperor Taiyi, and the others agreed and jumped up.</p>

  <p>Once they were settled down on his shoulders, he rushed forward and headed north again.</p>

  <p>The two faint shadows in the sky had never disappeared. They seemed to be completely isolated from the world. Like the moon and sun, they always followed him at a steady speed.</p>

  <p>At that moment, the two Shadow Warriors projected the scenes that they saw on an ice piece.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, three white balls floated on one side of the ice piece.</p>

  <p>Hot flames burned steadily in the center of one of the white balls. Not long after, a young girl's head appeared. It was none other than Claire.</p>

  <p>The moment Claire took shape, thunder and lightning cracked inside the white ball beside her and outlined a burly human figure. It turned out to be Les, the second of the three backbones of the Element Spirit Civilization.</p>

  <p>"A human boy actually defeated the Grandmaster of Heaven! Ha-ha-ha!"</p>

  <p>Les laughed in a hoarse voice.</p>

  <p>"My instincts never fail me," Claire said seriously, "though it's a pity that such a talent can't work for us."</p>

  <p>"So, he could only die…"</p>

  <p>This delicate voice came from the last white ball, which contained a strange-looking life form.</p>

  <p>The creature looked like a cold armor but had a pair of long light wings on the back.</p>

  <p>He was the last one of the three backbones of the Element Spirit Race, Slade.</p>

  <p>Les and Claire were both pure Element Spirits, and they had quite simple forms.</p>

  <p>However, Slade was different. He was made up of countless members of the Element Spirit race, who formed a world of their own inside his body. They controlled everything he did.</p>
