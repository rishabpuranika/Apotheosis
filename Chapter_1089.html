  <p>
</p>

  <p>In the Star Field Divine Kingdom, there were a total of six talents who managed to enter the first tier.</p>

  <p>Despite Titus' defeat, a lot of warriors were still ready to fight. After all, those six warriors didn't include people from the royal family of the Star Field Divine Kingdom. The likes of its kingdom's crown prince had a sure spot in the first tier rank.</p>

  <p>The Harlen Divine Kingdom, which Luo Luo Zheng happened to be a part of, was weak compared to the others. Apart from Randy and the crown prince Bram, only Gregory and Edwin were most likely to enter the first tier. In addition, Gregory had already been defeated. Technically, they only had Edwin left who could fight the battle.</p>

  <p>Of course, that was what the other divine kingdoms thought about the situation of the Harlen Divine Kingdom. Luo Luo Zheng had only made an exhibition of his abilities in the Jade Martial House, but he did not reveal too much of his strength. The other three divine kingdoms didn't even know of his existence.</p>

  <p>Under the command of the crown prince of the Star Field Divine Kingdom, the martial artist named Willard Yue showed up to battle.</p>

  <p>If Willard Yue was to be defeated by Logan, then the Star Field Divine Kingdom had lost to Logan twice after Titus.</p>

  <p>As someone whom the crown prince of Star Field Divine Kingdom had highly recommended, Willard had to win. If he was to lose again, then the reputation of their kingdom could suffer.</p>

  <p>However, the martial artists from the Star Field Divine Kingdom seemed to be very confident in Willard's strength. After he rushed up to the enchanted barrier in the sky, his fellow warriors were once again seething with excitement and hope.</p>

  <p>The warriors from Wisteria Martial House were the most pumped. Even Willard wasn't exactly from their house, they had great expectations for him. As someone who came from the same kingdom, he could help save the Wisteria Martial House's reputation if he defeated Logan.</p>

  <p>"Willard, you just need to avoid his sword. That guy only has his sword to rely on. He's got nothing else!"</p>

  <p>"Right, make sure not to get hit by his sword. With your speed, you can make it," the warriors in the audience suggested.</p>

  <p>Speed was definitely a pride of Willard. Everyone knew of his impeccable ability. He nodded to the crowd who encouraged him from below then turned to Logan. "Please," he said, gesturing for him to start.</p>

  <p>Since Logan had already drawn out his Space Chopping Sword, there was no reason for him to take it back. He held up three fingers towards Willard and said, "Three strikes. It will only take me three strikes to defeat you!"</p>

  <p>The warriors yelled once more, "You're too arrogant! If you really have the guts, Logan, come down here and see if you can avoid getting crushed into meat paste!"</p>

  <p>"Show us how you dodge those three strikes, Willard! If he doesn't defeat you in three strikes as he said, then he's a joke! It would be so fun to look at his humiliated face!"</p>

  <p>Many of the warriors from the Star Field Divine Kingdom resented Logan even before. His words were like gas being poured into flames, making them all the more furious than they already were.</p>

  <p>It wasn't something that bothered Logan, however. Truly, there were a lot of warriors at the Virtual Tribulation Realm in the four divine kingdoms.</p>

  <p>The warriors at the scene were basically at the first or the second tier, and most of them had the divine- level talent. But ultimately, only dozens of them could fly up and battle.</p>

  <p>To Logan, they all were nothing but a joke.</p>

  <p>The powerful Soul Sea Realm warriors on top of the steps turned a deaf ear to the commotion in the plaza. The heated atmosphere was good for competition. As long as those warriors didn't fight against each other physically, then they didn't step in.</p>

  <p>Amidst all the noise, Logan decided to launch the initial attack.</p>

  <p>He waved his Space Chopping Sword and took a step forward. He was able to come near Willard in just one swift move. It was like he traversed through space and not anyone had noticed. To everyone's surprise, the transparent sword in his hand was already slashing at Willard's head.</p>

  <p>That method of traveling through space was something Luo Luo Zheng was very familiar with. It could cause the opponent to not see what was coming and get caught off guard.</p>

  <p>It shocked Willard to see how fast and brisk Logan was. Truth be told, he had already lost his confidence the moment he found out he was going to fight against Logan. His strength was similar only to that of Titus. They had competed against each other for lots of times, and results always varied. However, Titus' victory count was more than his.</p>

  <p>Even so, Logan had defeated Titus, so it could mean that Titus' strength wasn't enough. How possibly could Willard stand a chance to win him?</p>

  <p>But it was the order of the crown prince, and he was left with no other choice but to put up a fight.</p>

  <p>If the strength of two martial artists was at the same level, then it was often the strong-willed one won. If one lost his confidence and momentum, he had nothing.</p>

  <p>When he heard about what the martial artists from the Star Field Divine Kingdom in the crowd had said, he also made a plan in his heart. Since Logan had boasted that he would defeat him with three strikes, then he needed to avoid those first.</p>

  <p>So instead of facing Logan's first strike, he chose to escape.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Since he was well-known for his speed, Willard had extraordinary bodily movements, too. Logan's first strike was only able to cut a little piece from the hems of Williard's robe, nothing more.</p>

  <p>Then, he began to spin in high speed inside the enchanted barrier. His intention was obvious. It was to avoid Logan's Space Chopping Sword.</p>

  <p>Seeing this scene, Luo Luo Zheng couldn't help but slightly shake his head. As the saying went, "A brave hero always wins the most fierce competition." If one didn't even have the courage to face the enemy head-on, then how could he win? Could it be that this fellow expected that Logan would let him go after three strikes? He was too naive.</p>

  <p>The three strikes that Logan mentioned were only to show off his power and to give Willard a little bit of pressure. Furthermore, he didn't mention that he would admit defeat if he failed to take Willard down after three strikes.</p>

  <p>"Whoosh!"</p>

  <p>Despite Willard's rapid movements, Logan was quite seasoned in Space Law. He only needed to take a single step to catch up with Willard and strike him with his sword.</p>
