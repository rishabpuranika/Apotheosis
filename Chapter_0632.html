<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b class="calibre3">Chapter 632 A Dilemma (Part One) </b></h2>
<b class="calibre3"><br/><br/></b>

  <p>
</p>

  <p>A runic expert was considered a money-making machine these days. The cost of becoming a runic expert was high, but it was worth the investment because it could guarantee great returns. Hence, being a runic expert had brought many riches to Felix' pocket. However, ten supreme crystals were still an extremely large expense to Felix despite having huge savings.</p>

  <p>Lasseter who was richer than Felix was unwilling to buy it at such high cost, as this meditation rune could only be used to soothe the nerves when cultivators practiced themselves but was useless in combat. Its value was not worth its price.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the source of this meditation rune posed a big mystery to everyone. They wondered where Luo Luo Zheng could have gotten such an expensive rune.</p>

  <p>Generally, the most expensive runes known to all cultivators were drawn by Arnold, the Son of Runes. Although the runes he had drawn already lost their value, they could still be sold at a sky-high price in auctions. It was because those are the last runes Arnold had drawn before he drew his last breath. His death put an end to such talent in the Central Region and no one had taken his place being a talented rune expert ever since.</p>

  <p>The last runes he had made were considered collector's items and had become quite expensive.</p>

  <p>But the rune before Lasseter and Felix appeared to be still useful which indicated that the person who drew it was still alive. It might not be considered a collectible yet, but because of the existence of this rune expert, even Arnold's last runes could lose their "collectible" status and their prices would crash.</p>

  <p>The value and price of a rune could soar high if the person who drew it had died. That was the case for Arnold's runes. However, this runic expect with such great talent could be a treasure to any sect. It would be a shame to let such a talented runic expert go to waste.</p>

  <p>Considering all these, Lasseter found it difficult to eventually give up.</p>

  <p>"Fine! I'll take the ten supreme crystals then!" Luo Luo Zheng said with a slight smile.</p>

  <p>When Luo Luo Zheng agreed to the price, Felix immediately took out ten supreme crystals from his space ring and handed it over. Luo Luo Zheng was so delighted to see the ten supreme crystals full of pure life vitality in his hands. But he had to play it cool, so he tried to hide the excitement on his face. These ten supreme crystals were equivalent to 10 million cubic crystals. But that was based only on general equivalent exchange. Considering the market price of each supreme crystal, Luo Luo Zheng could exchange them for a total of 20 million cubic crystals!</p>

  <p>In the past, Luo Luo Zheng thought that refining heavenly essence was already profitable business. If given ample time, he could make a lot of money with his heavenly essence. But in the Central Region, Luo Luo Zheng realized that the money he was making out of refining heavenly essence was nothing.</p>

  <p>After handing the payment over to Luo Luo Zheng, Felix took the divine texture from Luo Luo Zheng. He was holding it delicately like a baby and was totally absorbed in the bliss of divine intoxication. Felix had once seen the Perfect Brushwork on the sect protection array of Ethereal Spirit Sect, and he fell in love with it at the first sight. He was captivated and stunned to see it for the first time, but never really considered owning one. But now, he finally got himself a rune drawn with Perfect Brushwork. Though it was only a meditation rune, he was still fascinated by it.</p>

  <p>Lasseter just stood there and watched as Felix got the rune from Luo Luo Zheng. He was also a collector and had once seen the authentic work of Arnold. But as a merchant, he must always remain calm and not let his emotions drive his purchase. Lasseter was also keen on this rune, but he was hesitating to spend ten supreme crystals on it.</p>

  <p>Lasseter then looked at Luo Luo Zheng carefully. He was trying to comprehend how Luo Luo Zheng could have possibly gotten this meditation rune. It was highly unlikely that Luo Luo Zheng had drawn it himself. But if Luo Luo Zheng had acquired it from someone else, he should know where the runic expert was.</p>

  <p>Lasseter couldn't keep his mouth shut. He was eager to know where the said rune came from. So, he washed the suspicion off his face, smiled, and asked, "Mr. Luo, where did you get it?"</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng was still immersed in the joy of getting the ten supreme crystals. He heard Lasseter's inquiry and sensed the suspicion in the latter's tone, but he didn't care. He just laughed and said, "I have told you several times that I drew this rune myself. I even bought the painting materials from you yesterday."</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, Lasseter thought that Luo Luo Zheng just didn't want to tell the truth. But he was not the type to just give up, so he continued, "This is no time for a joke." The expression on Lasseter's face changed, but he tried to keep his cool. He continued, "Mr. Luo, if you know this runic expert, please introduce me to him. I'd like to personally meet him and buy as many runes as I can from him directly."</p>

  <p>"Sure! I still have seven runes here. If you really want them, I can sell them to you!" Luo Luo Zheng smiled broadly. Without looking at Lasseter, Luo Luo Zheng took out other seven meditation divine textures from his space ring and casually tossed them on the table.</p>

  <p>Felix was still overwhelmed with his newly acquired meditation rune. He thought that it was the most precious rune and no one else could have it aside from him. But when Luo Luo Zheng tossed seven more of the same runes, he was speechless.</p>

  <p>How could that be possible?</p>

  <p>When Lasseter saw those runes, a smirk crossed his face. The old clich? was proven true: Elderly people are more experienced. When Luo Luo Zheng first offered the meditation rune, Lasseter kept his calm and stopped bidding for it in time. He understood the power of waiting, and now he believed it was a wise decision after all.</p>

  <p>In this world, the worth of an item depended on its amount or number.</p>

  <p>When an item was rare and unique, its price would certainly soar and only the richest person could afford it. But as the number or amount of the said item increased, its worth would be lesser. Lasseter also took this into consideration earlier that was why he didn't bite into Luo Zheng's bidding.</p>

  <p>"Are they still useful?" Lasseter asked as he examined each rune carefully.</p>

  <p>Luo Luo Zheng didn't respond. He just poured seven rays of life vitality from his wrist into these seven divine textures. Instantly, the textures lighted up, filling the whole room with cyan light glow.</p>

  <p>Lasseter's eyes gleamed at the sight of the glowing runes. He couldn't believe his eyes. His heart felt like exploding, but he regained control over his emotions. He must remain objective. He finally said,</p>

  <p>"Interesting. I will take them all. But the price?" He looked at each rune again, carefully assessing its market value. He didn't want to pay ten supreme crystals for each rune. After all, their value had already gone down due to the increased numbers.</p>

  <p>"Your runes are likely to be of a new kind, and because they are drawn with Perfect Brushwork, their efficacy will be 30% higher compared to the normal ones. But as you know, meditation runes are of limited use.</p>

  <p>So, how about five supreme crystals for all the seven runes?" Lasseter grinned. He was haggling at a very low price. He gave Luo Luo Zheng the impression that his runes wouldn't cost more than one supreme crystal each. It was a "take it or leave it" deal.</p>
