<br/><br/>

  

  <p>
</p>

  <p>One white stone and one black stone falling on the Heaven Earth Board signified the start of one round of battle.</p>

  <p>An ordinary board would have a 19×19 grid of lines, containing 361 points. And there were 181 black stones and 180 white stones.</p>

  <p>So in theory, 361 battles should be enough to occupy the entire board.</p>

  <p>However, this Heaven Earth Board had a 36×36 grid of lines, which meant that there were a total of 1296 points.</p>

  <p>Until now, 290 elimination battles had ended, but the number of normal battles far exceeded the number of elimination matches. In total, 803 battles had been fought so far.</p>

  <p>But even after these 803 battles, the situation on the Heaven Earth Board was still unclear!</p>

  <p>This had not happened in the last grand era.</p>

  <p>In the last grand era, the mysterious girl had also played Go with herself, and it had ended soon. After only 726 battles, the white stones had already had an irreversible advantage.</p>

  <p>The clearer the situation on the Heaven Earth Board was, the easier it would be to predict the outcome.</p>

  <p>Currently, the situation of the black and white stones was still in chaos.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Lords that had analyzed the situation of the board so far already had their doubts.</p>

  <p>There were only five battles left between the remaining ten people, and one of them didn't need to fight. Then, out of the six people, there would be another three battles.</p>

  <p>Although there had been many victories and defeats, the remaining battles were insufficient to fill up the entire Heaven Earth Board.</p>

  <p>That was when the mysterious girl activated the round-robin system.</p>

  <p>When this rule was announced, Lone shot into the sky with his sword and landed on a stone.</p>

  <p>He slowly came to reason and looked at Zheng. He was still in a daze, as if he didn't know what had happened just now.</p>

  <p>"We Lost," the broken sword said to Lone.</p>

  <p>"Lost! I am eliminated..." Lone's face darkened.</p>

  <p>"We still have a chance..."</p>

  <p>"All right!"</p>

  <p>The relationship between Lone and the sword was like the relationship between a person's lips and teeth.</p>

  <p>Lone treated his sword as his teacher, and his sword treated him as a family.</p>

  <p>Even if he was occasionally controlled by his sword, he didn't mind. He was clear that if it wasn't for this sword, he wouldn't be as powerful as he was today.</p>

  <p>"What a pity..." Tianming gently shook his head.</p>

  <p>He knew that Zheng had other ways of resisting the sword, but he had still managed to pull off a trick.</p>

  <p>However, Zheng hadn't done anything wrong. It was a tactic to conserve his strength as much as possible before the final battle.</p>

  <p>It was not only Zheng who was doing this; every other Godly Genius present was doing the same thing.</p>

  <p>Round-robin battles could more accurately determine the differences in strength, and at the same time, lessen the psychological pressure on everyone.</p>

  <p>Then, the next battle was decided.</p>

  <p>The huge hand lightly landed on top of Shania's stone while the other hand picked up Lucille.</p>

  <p>It was a battle between these two ladies.</p>

  <p>"It's finally Lucille's turn to fight..."</p>

  <p>"Rumor has it that she still hasn't completely mastered the Five Elements Godly Way. Her current power should be slightly inferior to Lawson's, right?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care who wins and loses. I'm just here to see a beauty!"</p>

  <p>The name Lucille Ji was extremely famous in the Thoughtless Minds.</p>

  <p>After all, she was half a Godly Genius of the Ji Clan. Of the four great clans, the Ji Clan was second only to the Xuanyuan Clan. In addition, Lucille's appearance and figure were perfect, making her the dream woman of countless martial artists.</p>

  <p>However, most of them had only heard rumors. Lucille had spent most of her time cultivating in the Ji Clan, so most martial artists hadn't actually seen her before. Now that they'd finally seen her, they couldn't take their eyes off of her.</p>

  <p>At this moment, Lucille slowly stepped down from the stone. Her almond-shaped face had a pair of cold eyes that seemed to be able to freeze one's soul. She was emitting a graceful and magnanimous aura.</p>

  <p>The men who were looking at her through the Illusion Space couldn't help but have vulgar thoughts in their heads.</p>

  <p>However, when they sensed her temperament, their hearts trembled, and all their dirty thoughts disappeared in an instant.</p>

  <p>And anyway, it was true that Lucille was a beauty, but Shania was just as beautiful.</p>

  <p>Shania had wavy hair hanging down past her shoulders, and her entire body was exuding a vigorous vitality. Her every move seemed to emit a strong life force. Her dark green leather armor was wrapped tightly around her body, accentuating her impressive figure.</p>

  <p>The slim and graceful Lucille stood still, but after Shania got off the stone, she walked straight to Lucille.</p>

  <p>Her knee-length leather boots clicked on the board as she walked. Her round face had a trace of an elegant smile on it.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Lucille, right?" she said.</p>

  <p>Lucille tilted her head slightly as she stared at the woman of the Demon Night race in front of her.</p>

  <p>'Shania?' she thought.</p>

  <p>She had never heard of such a Godly Genius in the Demon Night race, and it seemed as if this Shania had appeared out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Shania's gaze made her uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>It was a gaze that only someone who had been in a position of power for a long time would have.</p>

  <p>She'd seen this kind of gaze only from the elders of the four clans, or even the patriarch of the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm Lucille," she replied coldly.</p>

  <p>Shania smiled. "You're a good sapling. Your base of the Godly Way is very stable. If you really enter the Five Elements Godly Way, you might grow rapidly in a single day. But…"</p>

  <p>"Thanks for the compliment, we can start now," Lucille interrupted Shania in a cold voice. She didn't like the way that Shania spoke to her, as if she was inferior to her.</p>

  <p>"I'm not done yet. You're being rude," Shania said as she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" Lucille snorted.</p>

  <p>With Lucille's proud personality, how could she listen to the words of this woman? She was the first to take a step forward.</p>

  <p>Whoosh!</p>

  <p>A sharp chill was emitted from Lucille's body.</p>

  <p>The Five-element Finger Chain in her hands began to glow with the light of the laws of the five elements. As she rushed forward, her slender fingers turned into sharp claws that swept toward Shania!</p>

  <p>"Five Elements Supreme Claw!"</p>

  <p>This Lucille was completely different from the Lucille that Zheng had met that day.</p>

  <p>At that time, Lucille had split herself into two bodies, which had greatly reduced her power. But now, she was at her peak.</p>

  <p>The moment she attacked, she used ultimate technique of the patriarch of the Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>A ear-piercing tearing sound came from the space next to Shania.</p>

  <p>Like a piece of paper, the space was torn apart by the Five Elements Supreme Claw, and from that hole, a claw extended toward Shania.</p>

  <p>If Shania were to be hit by this claw, she would be torn to pieces.</p>

  <p>However, Shania only smiled at Lucille.</p>

  <p>Her smile was like the blooming of a water fairy; it had the ability to captivate anyone who saw it.</p>

  <p>Then, she stretched out a single finger in front of the Five Elements Supreme Claw.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>The claw instantly disintegrated.</p>

  <p>Lucille's expression immediately changed. She lightly tapped the board with her feet. Her dress fluttered slightly and her body moved to the side.</p>

  <p>Instead of faltering, she once again used her claw to strike down from above.</p>

  <p>This time, Shania looked up and raised her hand above her forehead, as if she was blocking out the sun.</p>

  <p>Then, she extended a single finger to block Lucille's attack once again.</p>

  <p>Not only did this scene sour Lucille's mood, but it also agitated the entire Ji Clan.</p>

  <p>"The Five Elements Supreme Claw... Even Nathan cannot block it so easily!"</p>

  <p>"Who on earth is this Shania?!"</p>

  <p>"Due to the internal strife within the Demon Night race, they haven't produced any amazing talents. How did this one appear out of nowhere?"</p>

  <p>In the past few years, although the competition between the two queens of the Demon Night race had not affected the foundation of the entire race, it had definitely affected their prosperity. What was most obvious was that the number of geniuses had drastically decreased. When the world of chaos had arrived, the geniuses of all the races had turned up, but the Demon Night race had been an exception. Their talents couldn't compete with those from other races at all.</p>

  <p>But this time, much to everyone's confusion, a talent from the Demon Night race had suddenly appeared.</p>

  <p>"I told you, I wasn't done yet. Are you ready to listen now?" Shania stubbornly repeated, as if she wasn't going to make a move before she finished her words.</p>

  <p>Lucille's forehead was slightly creased. She stared at Shania and asked,</p>

  <p>"What do you want to say?"</p>

  <p>"That's more like it." Shania smiled. A plant rapidly grew on her palm, and from it bloomed a blood-red rose. "Your aptitude and future are limitless, but now that you've met me, it's better to surrender as soon as possible. In any case, this is a round-robin battle; if you surrender, you won't be eliminated. Although warriors can't die in this Illusion Battlefield, crushing the mind and body of such a seedling would be a sin on my part."</p>
